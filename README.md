### Introduction:
Have you ever seen a movie so bad or so great that you wondered what others felt about it? well, that is the story behind this project, personally, ***Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness*** wasn't all that good. So, out of curiousity, I decided to know what others felt about the movie, and that is why I took on this Project.


### Data Source:
Looking at this Repo, you will see two ipynb files namely ***"review_scrapedfile"*** and ***"Sentiment-analysis.ipynb"***. looking at the reviewscrapedfile, the reviews which were used for this analysis were scraped off of Imdb's website with this link https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9419884/reviews?sort=helpfulnessScore&dir=desc&ratingFilter=0. The Analysis were carried out in the second ipynb file.
