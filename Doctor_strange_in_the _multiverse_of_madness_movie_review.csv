"This was Wandavision 2, not Doctor Strange 2",
"Well, it was shiny and colourful",
Not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness,"Sam Raimi definitely put a splash of horror in this action film. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is darker & more violent than any previous MCU movie, which could be considered a strength. However, I felt like there was not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness. Despite the entertaining visuals, the plot is fairly chaotic, and the acting & dialogue are inconsistent. This movie is an entertaining ride, but it's a little too messy to stand on its own."
"Scarlet Witch: The Movie, ft: Sorcerer Supremes",
"Terrible plot and script, boring and pointless","I always had some issues with MCU films but now they aren't even entertaining? Oh Raimi, what a disappointment. I honestly only liked the horror elements and being able to see some blood in a MCU film. Nothing else.

The plot is super weak - the worst of the film - but the script is also very erroneous with some strange and unexplainable writing decisions. There are some interesting shots - some Dutch angles and POV are cool - but this feel stupidly long for a film that is just 2 hours long. It's like watching the action going from setpiece to setpiece in a very inorganic way while travelling between boring universe with a lot of cringe dialogue. I don't even get the point of all this story for the entire universe and even the score - surprisingly considering that is Elfman - is super generic.

I won't lie: I had much more fun watching Eternals, Captain Marvel or Wonder Woman 1984 than this one. Said it."
"Convuluted story, just like the multiverse",
"somewhere in the multiverse, there's a better version of this movie that exists.","The overall pacing is relentless and the sequel shows its hand a lot earlier than you'd expect. There's been endless speculation from fans about the villain, which i won't spoil here, but it's revealed surprisingly quickly.

You can't help that feel somewhere in the multiverse, there's a better version of this movie that exists."
Seems Rushed For A Two-Hour Movie,
Very uninteresting,
Time to retire the MCU,"After months of hype, we are left with a mess of a story that is mostly just CGI blobs, some light shows and some boring dialogue. I loved the first Strange movie, it's my second favorite after Captain America Winter Soldier. So this was extra disappointing.

Firstly, you're not going to have any idea what's going on with the main antagonist unless you watched the Disney+ show Wandavision. Even though I did watch it, it had been months, and I didn't remember all the details, so her whole backstory fell flat. This movie was less about Strange and more about her.

There's also a subplot involving Strange's old flame, but since we only saw them as exes in the previous film, it Didn't really feel that impactful.

There's also an obligatory teen sidekick, which I guess is now standard in the Phase IV fully Disneyized MCU. She might have been interesting, but she's just there as a macguffiin and has no real personality.

There's also random cameos from other Marvel properties, I'm beginning to see these bits of crossover fan service are the sole purpose of having a multiverse.

Seriously, I don't know why I keep giving my money to this franchise. Black Widow, Eternals, Shang Chi and now Dr Strange 2, have all been dull, uninspired CGI crap fests, that rely entirely on cameos and fan service to keep people coming back. Let's just face it, Hollywood milked all they could from Marvel. It's time to give the franchise ( and maybe all superhero movies)a good 10-15 year rest and reboot it after audiences grow nostalgic."
Pretentious nonsensical hokum,"Richard Burton wasted his talents on alcohol. Let's hope Benedict Cumberbatch doesn't waste his talent on Marvel. What does it take, time wise, for him to make one of these derivative, adolescent wastes of cinematic energy? How many real films might he make, how many plays might he contribute to, were he not involved in this childish pablum?"
Scooby Doo Meets Ghost Busters in nonsense fest,"I rolled my eyes at this film in disbelief.

This is just a fan service film , an absolute nonsense 'fan mash up'.

Incoherent from start to finish, at best the plot was non sensical, at worst non-existant.

What makes it more bizarre is the cast of such good actors in such an appalling film.

Do not waste your money.2/10

If this wasn't enought the CGI was shockingly bad and make up appalling and make up prosthetics amateur.

I gather they did multiple reshoots of the film at the last minute, clearly this has been a disaster."
Disappointing,"I can't believe I am writing a bad Marvel review but I can't lie, this movie was really disappointing. A couple of surprises but I was expecting way more after watching No way home.... Didn't mind the horror side of the story, actually made me laugh. As for the music , I am a huge fan of Danny Elfman but even the music was bad.

I won't watch this one again. Marvel we are used to greatness please don't do that again!"
Multiverse of... Something-ness,"Doctor Strange 2 is the MCU's latest balls-to-the-wall crossover event, and it's noticeably not as well done as everything else was in Spider-Man: No Way Home. The effects and action are nice, but the story squanders a palpable script in favour of frustratingly fragmented (which multiverses can suffer from when stories don't address all the inherent issues of multiple worlds directly interacting with each other) fan-service and even more sequel-fodder with its abrupt cliff-hanger ending (pre-post-creds mind you, but still).

Doctor Strange 2 covers its concept of multiverses instead of telling a re-inventive character-driven story like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse had. Doctor Strange 2's got splashes of self-aware humour here and there, but it's gonna have to take some magic to become a film comparable to the MCU's stronger entries.

The most notable thing about the film is how many opportunities it squanders with its many supporting characters introduced and then never really getting utilised in the story (except for one). It teases endless narrative possibilities courtesy of the last Spider-Man movie doing so with its lead, but Doctor Strange 2 teases fan service only to deliver shortcomings instead of going all the way with its promise of 'madness' in the title. The good stuff IS there; it just doesn't have enough story-breathing-room in the film.

Doctor Strange 2 is definitely a noble attempt at something 'new' for the MCU, and it's sure as hell more confident than Eternals, but it suffers the same character-squandering issues as it.

With a universe as vast as Marvel's, not every entry in the MCU was guaranteed to work. At least it tried."
Cannot explain my disappointment,"I could have actually cried watching this. Dr. Strange is one of my favourite Marvel movies but this was just plain awful. 1 hour in and I was debating leaving. Marvel are losing their touch, and ever since Endgame, it just hasn't felt the same, apart from NWH. Sam Raimi messed up big time."
"Another failure by Disney, Big Fail!","Let me say that it just doesn't follow any of the original Stan Lee Marvel Comics.

Possibly the Worst of all the Movies made this far.

I feel terrible for Dr. Strange and The Scarlet Witch for having their characters so discombobulated.

If you can just buy anything that Disney shoved down your throat, than you will love this movie.

Just Ughfull."
Hugely disappointing mess,
Dr Stupid in the Mashed Potatoes,Really!@#$ Can you make a more stupid film? Were the writers stoned and when they wrote the script? It's just one silly scene after another. Did I mention the terrible acting? Did they get paid for this? If it weren't for the great special effects this film would be completely worthless.
Dr strange 2 More like WandaVision 2,"I really miss the old MCU movies where it was making a stand alone super hero movie is simple, But after (End game) thing changed for better or worse.

-During watching the movie I kept wondering, whose movie is it?

-Sam Raimi did a great job.i liked the fight scene , the horror elements he adds to the movie it was creative,But it wasn't enough.

-The writing was bad and very cheesy.

-Where is (Vision ,loki ,TVA ) ??



-Don't watch it with high exceptions."
What A Mess! I Want My 2 Hours Back!,"This definitely wasn't what I expected. It started out good and I was thinking: All Right, Here we go. But that didn't last very long. Then it got so chaotic and scattered. It went everywhere and nowhere. Because you couldn't follow it in a meaningful way. I won't give any spoilers. I'll just say that I was highly disappointed. And once I got past the half-hour mark, I actually considered walking out. This film deserved a better script and a more appropriate director. Raimi wasn't the best choice for a Doctor Strange film. Other stuff he's directed, I love. But this was a Hot Mess!"
Unfortunate decline in story,
Terrible,"This was by far the worst marvel so far. The plot was all over the place bringing in all these characters that had no purpose. I wish they would just stop trying to create avengers within avengers, just ruins it."
Massively improves on a second viewing,
Oh boy its bad...,"Lets clarify: Of course all Marvel movies have great production and usually established actors and actresses, BUT.... After seeing a couple dozens now, the writing is just taking a nose dive, especially in this one.

There is not one memorable line or a joke or something in this movie. Its even emotionally dull and boring. You know pretty much what will happen form the start. The writing is lazy at best and for a 200 million dollar poduction or whatever it was its actually scandolously bad. I'm surprised the actors are not bored out of their minds with these kinda stupid dialogs.

The good you would ask? Spectactular CGI... and i mean really award winning type of stuff. The rest...belongs where your toilet is.

Its the same thing boiled up over and over like your last bad of green tea."
Greedy Disney's going to wreck our favorite movie franchises!,"They obviously believe in the ""quantity vs. Quality"" business theory, and seem quite content to continue pumping out these mediocre entries in the Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar brands, until their formerly dedicated audiences finally cry ""enough!"", and just...walk away, shaking their collective heads at how sad it was, the day The Mouse bought the rights to these storied franchises. My only remaining hope is that they'll pump the breaks and not try to over saturate us with the two best remaining storylines - those being the wonderfully heart-filled Ant Man and Spider-Man series, which are the only ones (so far) they haven't managed to ruin. MFF/Honolulu 7-23-22."
One of the worst superhero movies out there,"Dr. Strange here was absolutely weak and cringy throughout. His forced jokes, same expressions and annoying SFX were too much to handle. There were some good action sequences, but it felt like the movie was made for under 14-year-olds as adults would've a hard time enjoying it. Yes, the multiverse theme was enticing, but a poor antagonist with a disappointing ending doesn't just cut it.

Dr. Strange doesn't feel like a superhero but a mediator. Not an enjoyable experience and dialogues were just awful."
Some Bald Guy Once Said: Keep Your Expectations Low and You Will Never Be Disappointed,"So thanks to watching some early reviews on YouTube saying this is more of a Doctor Strange and Wanda movie than a Multiverse movie, I adjusted my expectations and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.

And you might say, ""well it's literally called Multiverse of Madness, how do you expect me not to expect a Multiverse from this movie"", which I agree with. I had the same expectation when I first heard about the name of the movie and saw the trailers. But trust me, the whole thing revolves around the Multiverse And there is a lot of Madness, but not in a way you're thinking of. Naming this movie Multiverse of Madness was a real double-edged sword and it really shows, by how people reacted to it.

First of all, I gotta say that this is probably the most different and unique movie of MCU, at least in the aesthetic department, or should I say the most different-looking. And you already know it's exactly because of Sam Raimi and the horror and creepy aspect he introduces in this movie. And I loved it!

About the runtime, I remember seeing people argue that 2 hours is not actually bad and Sam Raimi movies are always more or less 2 hours and we are the unreasonable ones to think 2 hours. And I and many others thought ""well how is a movie about the multiverse is gonna be only 2 hours? We need at least 3 hours"". Which weren't wrong, because after watching the movie I can say that it definitely needed at least 20 more minutes. The pacing is really on and off, it kinda lingers in some scenes and it fast-forwards in some scenes that needed more time, especially the ending. I think they just need to hire better writers because once again, this didn't ""feel"" a movie, it felt like an episode and a teaser to the real thing, but I still really enjoyed it and had fun with it.

And it is really weird too because the last movie they released was literally 2:28 hours and they've already seen that the longer runtime still sells like Infinity War and the 3-hour Endgame which are like in the top 5 of all time sellers in BoxOffice. I don't know why they cut scenes or why they didn't let some scenes linger more. Was it because of the writing? Then why not hire better writers or a team of writers like Markus and McFeely who knew what they were doing and gave us 4 decently written movies? I hope now that they're delving into the multiverse stuff, they actually get more creative writers and work on the script a lot more before releasing the movie.

It would be interesting to see a director's cut of the movie or even a Scott Derrickson version where he actually continued the first movie and not mainly WandaVision (which is an understandable problem people have with this), but we'll never see just like we'll never see Edgar Wright's Ant-Man. If I were in Feige's, I'd just go crazy with every movie and give 100% freedom to directors to make whatever tf they want and go nuts with it and have a different MCU next to the main one. And even now is the best time to do it, why not let Edgar Wright make an Ant-Man movie and call it something like What If Ant-Man...? This is the perfect opportunity for them to go crazy with the multiverse stuff, but I guess making movies is hard and expensive, but I doubt these movies won't sell. Just give directors full control and hire better writers and writing teams and the word of mouth and the good reviews do the rest, just like Everything Everywhere All at Once.

For people that are concerned about cameos and think this is gonna be a cameo galore and fanservice, don't worry. The cameos are fairly short, they are great and serve the plot, and are not just there just to be there, and they have some of the most brutal scenes I've seen from MCU. There was one particular scene that you know when you see it, that trod the line between PG-13 and R, and was so brutal that if you showed me the clip of it without context and without telling me anything, I would assume it was a scene from The Boys season 3. Yeah, that level of brutality!

Danny Elfman did the score and it fit the movie and the gothic vibe beautifully and there was a certain battle that I'm not gonna even hint at, but you'll know when you watch the movie, that was just audio-visual delight. I am a little disappointed and sad that they didn't use the amazing Doctor Strange theme Michael Giacchino did, and I think he would've done an amazing job if they kept him, but I guess Danny is Sam's blue-eyed boy. But the score is still good, just wish his iconic theme was used more in this movie.

The visuals were amazing too, although it still had some that looked really bad, and it seems like Marvel has been lacking with CGI in this phase more than before, even in the tv shows.

But the thing about the visuals is that even though they are great and a joy to witness, I kinda miss the reality-bending we got in the first movie and No Way Home, I wish they used it here too and went crazier with it.

And as for the direction, I gotta say it's pretty good and it's obvious Sam Raimi directed it as it has his fingerprint all over this movie and I loved it. It seems like Marvel is getting a little more open to having visionary directors take the helm and give them freedom. It's obvious that this movie is not given to Sam with 100 percent freedom, but I think they're getting a little bit better and I hope this freedom becomes bigger in the next projects. Sam Raimi does a great job with all the creepy, horror scenes, and the jump scares and this movie is more about witchcraft than it is about wizardry and spells. I really hope they keep doing these different genres and don't just stick to action-comedy as they've been for a long time. It's a breath of a fresh air seeing this being a different kind of superhero movie.

I also really liked that he actually used a good color grading and that the colors and environments are alive and that they don't look like another bland Marvel movie.

I don't think I need to talk about the acting because you already know they all do an amazing job. But surprisingly Wanda is the star of this movie and some people have a problem with that? I get that it's called Doctor Strange and this movie kinda lets Wanda outshine him, but did you also have a problem with Infinity War being more of a Thanos movie, or The Dark Knight is more of a Joker movie? I don't get that people say Doctor Strange had less things to do or even less cool things to do than Infinity War, because it felt to me that they both had more of or the same amount of screen-time and Doctor Strange had obviously more screen time.

And America Chavez is a really interesting and a great addition to the MCU and Xochitl Gomez did a good job of portraying her.

Some reviews said that Christine Palmer was again underutilized, which I guess? But I don't know what more they could've done with the fast pacing of this movie and I thought they did a decent job with Palmer anyway. Obviously, and as I said before, this movie could've benefited from some breathers and 20 extra minutes, but it was still fine.

We also get Ashley Williams of course! And Bruce Campbell is great as ever. You can't have a Sam Raimi movie without Ash!

I also heard some people say that they liked the first one better, which it's ok I guess? You could argue that the pacing of the first movie was better and Stephen Strange had a good development in there, but since the villain sucked in that movie, I cannot say that the first one is better. The villain and ""their"" motivation in this movie were far better in this movie, and I guess they had some movies and shows to get more development and it's kinda unfair to compare and say this one had more development because duh. But even if this was their first appearance, they still had a better motivation and were a better character anyway. (I'm using ""they"" to not spoil who the villain is but I think it's obvious for anyone who that is)

In conclusion, this movie might not be what you think is going to be, so manage your expectations. The acting is great, the direction and Sam Raimi's touch are great and so is the cinematography, the music is good but disappointingly there is little to no use of Doctor Strange's iconic theme, the villain is good, the visuals are great but it needed more visuals and reality-bending from the first one, the horror aspect is fine and gives a fresh look to the MCU, but it's ultimately rushed, the pacing needed some work and needed extra time. I also forgot to say that there are some loose ends left from the first movie that they didn't deal with for some reason and it's not really a continuation of Doctor Strange as it is more a continuation of WandaVision, and in that case, people are kinda right if they think this wasn't that much of a Doctor Strange movie and more Wanda's.

Maybe I'm just a little carried away and I'm giving it an 8 impulsively, and I am doing it as I've done times before, and watching it a second time will show me its flaws better, and yeah it's not a full 8/10 but more like a 7.5 leaning towards 8 and I liked this one more than the first one.

Update: Watched it a second time and I think I like it a little less and noticed more problems with it, but I still like it, so I'm changing it to a 7 here."
Utterly disappointed,
A Puzzle No One Cares To Solve,"Oh director Sam Raimi is up to his ""Army Of Darkness"" ways. What with the cameos from Bruce Campbell, a spell book, slapstick snap zooms at canted angles and the Pontiac Delta 88 hovering in a muddled universe. This is a very sloppy slapping together of an intricate storyline of wish fulfillment...if only the bad gal wasn't so into being...a mother? Yeah, that is at the core of the conflict. Wanda the Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) wants the life of domestication versus being shunned as a witch in her own world. Therefore, she must harness the power of a teenager who has this gift.

Okay.

Unfortunately, what she also has IS the power to live the other woman's life (it's really her, if you think about it) in small doses. And only if she uses some spell book. Who knows. The entire thing is this dense. Meanwhile, Doc Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is lamenting about his own life. Losing Christine (Rachel McAdams) to a different suitor because it would be safer for her. Such is the life of comic book heroes. A tired trope actually. So he is saddled with that question...in any other universe, would he end up with the love of his life. I shrug here, because all of this is really inconsequential since it never is addressed in the movie anyway. And they have the chemistry of a brother and sister. So I don't get her appeal.

Yeah, I think this is an above average flick. Only because I do miss the old Raimi style. This brought back those memories. Other than that, I found myself dozing at parts. The special effects, while really well done, are oftentimes nauseating. Anyone with vertigo should be warned. And, well, it seemed very empty when all was said and done.

To me, the multiverse is a fascinating question. One that was wonderfully realized in ""Everything, Everywhere And All At Once"" Here it seems to be a non-issue. And it aggravated me that in every universe they visit, it seems this crew don't address the chaos and mayhem they inflict on the people of the city. I mean, some of the damage to property should closed the city down. In this film, you see teen America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) eat a torta a scene later. Ugh.

The biggest nagging thought is how unnecessary this installment was. Why? Why was this made? Made no sense in the grander future schemes. Perhaps Marvel nerds can answer this.

It is also much more adult. Which was a pleasant surprise. I can tell that the kids who went to see this got very lost. Their silence said it all. And for that, I am grateful."
The worst marvel movie to date,"Fell asleep multiple times through this mess. Seemed low budget with cheap fx. Bad green screen throughout the entire movie. The character ""America"" is very unlikeable. Her bad acting from her annoying screaming, and her same annoying expression the whole movie. She shouldn't of been casted. Hopefully she's a one off because she has no on screen presence. Stupid ""woke"" trash in the movie. Pride flag pin on her jacket and she has 2 lesbian mothers. Like give me a break Disney.... Glad I didn't watch this trash in theatres."
What an absolute let-down,
"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Mundane Mediocrity, More like.","The Good: Literally ONLY the 1st 40 minutes, fantasy gore and violence, morally ambiguous characters, and cameo appearances.

The Bad: Unnecessarily Woke AF, paper-thin plot, and tame family-friendly horror (More ""The Addams Family"" than ""The Evil Dead"", but for a PG-13 it could have done with more surrealist visuals, like Mysterio's nightmarish illusion sequence in ""Spiderman: Far From Home"").

The Verdict: After a promising 1st act, this film descends into what is essentially a triple-bill of WandaVision episodes (The price you pay for seeing a theatrical feature written by a TV writer is you pay for a TV movie). It just feels flat and a missed opportunity for both Raimi and Marvel. Not a patch on the 1st ""Doctor Strange"", and nowhere near as cinematic. Hell, even season 2 of CW's ""The Flash"" handled the Multiverse better. Way better. And no, I'm not biased-- I gave ""The Batman"" 1/10. Both films are awful. This is marginally more entertaining."
A Seriously Superb and Creative Concept Executed Blandly,"Sometimes alike but also usually unalike most of the Avengers superhero movies in the MCU, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a giant mess. It's especially disappointing since its 2016 predecessor was surprisingly a blast; it featured a talented neurosurgeon who lost the ability to use his hands properly after a car crash, following towards some solid drama and his entertaining journey to becoming a superhero. The Multiverse of Madness understandably isn't that, and shouldn't just be a sequel that watches the first film before its new story, but its just too chaotic.

You would probably find the film a lot more enjoyable if you properly read and understood what it was actually about, because the trailer was just convoluted and the film is actually about Doctor Strange opening a portal to the multiverse that includes alternate versions of himself, other people and lifestyle. Even for a 2 hour movie, this film feels very rushed, overly pacy and it just ends up convoluted in the way the multiverse works and what happens. It's definitely entertaining and really engages you, but you probably need to go and break down the story to understand it.

The action battle between Doctor Strange and the octopus-alien monster really gets you engaged, but all of the action is very loud and too rushed. It's alike Marvel movies for using the same predictable basis Marvel creates for superheroes, meaning big fans of Marvel will probably really enjoy it. This movie mostly deserves points for its new characters and the whole idea of Doctor Strange entering the multiverse (of madness). The characters are executed well and wisely use the talents of a brilliant cast, but the concept is just too rushed and could use some times to stop and take a breath. It's also worth noting that Sam Raimi uses lots of horror scenes and jump-scares throughout this movie, so it's much scarier than other Marvel blockbusters.

If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."
ugh,Same old boring story the first one had something different but this one is just dark with terrible marvel jokes can't believe i wasted money on this trash this movie doesn't deserves review it is that level of crap and garbage.
A movie that does what many don't,
Buried my fandom in a shallow grave,"Garbage movie with no redeeming qualities. About as subtle as a Michael Bay film, with none of the plot intricacies. Wastes Wanda Maximoff's years of character development. Only one of three movies I've ever wanted to walk out of."
Does this film belong to Dr. Strange? NO!,"The main story, being quite absurd and ordinary, focuses so much on Wanda and America that Dr. Strange ""strangely"" gets sandwiched in between them. It almost feels you are watching a Wanda film rather than a Dr. Strange film. This was a huge negative as he leaves barely any impact. Majority of the impact is left by Wanda only who puts up a near Civil war like situation with Strange.

This is a VFX heavy film. Lots and lots and lots of special effects like any other Marvel film but here, to mask the poor story has been used. It is only this that make the film enjoyable. Often certain fight sequences also make the film enjoyable. Humor also works wherever present.

Overall, watch only if you are a die hard follower of marvel series (both films amd web series). If not, then Requesting not to watch just due to peer pressure as many things will go above your head and you will only end up enjoying the vfx nothing else."
Profit mongers,I'm glad only have one cineworld unlimited card for both of us to use with 2-1 movies. Every time a Marvel film comes out they bin everything else to maximise profit. Was Nic Cage film I wanted to see but gone after 1 week.oh yeah the film boring.zzz.
Should we call for #ReleaseTheRaimiCut?,"I don't know, man. The movie felt like a 126 minutes long teaser for... something. They should've let Sam Raimi do his thing and release the actual cut of the film. Raimi himself said his version was around 160 minutes, which is necessary for a movie of this scope.

This is why I think the MCU should've hit the brakes after Avengers: Endgame. I know it was a bit disappointing, but was an ending nonetheless. Not every single Marvel comic book out there has be filmed."
Don't worry spoilers won't spoil this movie,
This is a mess (I did like the first Dr. Strange movie),"The evolution of the superhero movie. Things started out with the original Superman and Batman movies. Then came the Marvel and DC universes.

Now this is where we are at. Take a few well known characters and just throw everything into the sfx stew and stir it up. Super Smash Bros. On nonstop steroids and meth. Jackson Pollock would say this is too much.

It is time for a superhero mass extinction event."
I doubt this a marvel movie,
A very 'Meh' movie,"It had some really cheesy parts in the script. Ended poorly, was built up to be amazing, it wasn't. It had some great jump scares though. Go in to the film with no expectations on cameos, you will be disappointed."
Is this a parody?... So embarrassing,Wtf?... This is like a generic superhero movie that was made before 2010...wake up Sam Raimi.. It's not 2005 anymore.. Superhero movies didn't come up just yesterday.. I can't believe this is a phase 4 marvel movie.. And what's up with marvel after Endgame?.. After the cheap eternals movie..the snooze-fest called Spiderman NWH.. A bunch of mediocre streaming shows.. And now this !... Marvel is just selling out at this point...the MCU is dying...
Little bit of nothing,
Wrong title,"This movie has the worst title ever, even though the plot manages to be compelling.

Misleading title aside, the story of this movie manages to be compelling, especially in the second act, which is amazing being totally different from anything Marvel has done in the past, this second act is terrifying and very shocking, but the third act ends up being the worst of the film, it doesn't even seem like it's a Doctor Strange movie, and there's an emotional moment that doesn't go deep, something that a previous Marvel production already did. The main character doesn't manage to have a change to what we've seen before, the new characters don't impact much, but the cameos are amazing. The special effects are good most of the time and the photography manages to give us good shots in action scenes.

It complies as a superhero movie by giving us something different from what Marvel has accustomed us to, despite its not-so-surprising script, but at a certain point the third act ruins the intentions of this movie, it is a passable and enjoyable movie to distract you."
"Forget the ""cinema"" debate - this barely felt like a movie","How is it possible to be overstimulated and bored at the same time? There are glimpses of fun - some visuals, Raimi camera work, Benedict is good as usual - but at no point did I connect to characters or feel like stuff wasn't just being made up as it went along. Why is Wanda in this? Why does strange trust her at all? Why did the Illuminati scene feel like an advert for highly detailed adult ""action figures""? Is this what we get excited about now, casting and licensing? Bad."
Sam Raimi Doing What He Does Best,"While this film has a more grim tone than its predecessors it's still a Marvel film at heart. Of course it would take Sam Raimi to find the perfect blend of comic-book-movie, horror, fantasy and slapstick. He might be working with a massive budget now, but the man stays true to his roots and sticking with what he knows pays off.

The pacing may seem disjointed or fragmented at times, but I feel that only reflects the complex nature of the multiverse within the film. Maybe it's not like other groundbreaking MCU films, but ultimately this is an entertaining feature."
"Odds are this movie has a much better story in other universes, oh, and of course, the food is free!","It's not that I don't like Doctor Strange, I loved the first movie and his appearances in other films, but this I didn't enjoy at all. Directing was not the issue, acting wasn't the best, but again not the problem, it was clearly the script. As a fan of Wandavision it didn't even deliver on that front. Like others have said, I was expecting a whole lot more multiverse and less madness. Halfway through I thought maybe the ending would save it for me, it did not. I hate to say it but I think it's a pass, I would MUCH rather sit through Morbius again. I think they wasted an opportunity to make an amazing multiverse movie, opening alternative paths to future movies and TV series. Disappointing."
Really disappointing,"No character development, weak plot and cheesy dialogue. A big disappointment overall. They did Scarlet Witch dirty when the arch had so much potential. Her motives were just not convincing. The whole story is overdone and Marvel could have done something much more unique. Trash."
Marvel meets 80s style horror,"This won't be a fan favourite but mixing the marvel cinema experience with a splash of ""old school"" horror hit the target for me.

It's weird, but id go as far as saying that a marvel movie was the best horror flick I've seen in over a decade.

Dark, creepy and visually epic.

The plot was pretty basic, but i had fun watching.

I like that they're mixing it up."
Darkest marvel movie yet!,"Whatever your thoughts are about Marvel you have to give them credit for their worldbuilding and character development. Wanda and Dr. Strange are both very unique and gray characters which makes them fun. The actors also do a great job portraying their characters.

Marvel has never been this dark before. I'm honestly surprised it hasn't got a higher age limit. But it's great with darker content. Marvel has for a long time felt too childish but this feels more real and got a stronger effect.

The multiverse is a very confusing subject and it can ruin movies, but it can also make them more fun. This movie did a good job not making it too confusing while also utilizing it and creating fun fanservice.

Like the previous Doctor Strange movie, the visual effects are spectacular and breathtaking. There are some scenes which are not quite as believable but it doesn't take the viewer out of the movie.

The problem with these powerful magic characters is that they are too overpowered. There's a lot of plot armor, but it's almost impossible to avoid when you're playing with these powerful heroes. The magic can be a bit convoluted at times, but just remind yourself that it's a movie. Don't try poke holes at every plothole or stupid decision. Just have fun because it's a fun movie."
"The first MCU project that manages to break free from the ""Marvel formula""",
Felt more like Disney +,
I really wanted to like this movie but....,
Multi-waste of time and talent,"Here we go into the multi-verse! A note that will effort my review of this movie... I gave up comics when the multi-verse first showed up from the look and feel of this more noise than story, I will probably do the same with Marvel/DC movies now that that seal has been broken. Love Cumberbatch, Wong, and will watch Ejotor anytime but pretty much done with twin. Nice scenery as always, hated the musical fight (very Disney), the Capt. P. - Fantastic 4 scene ridiculous waste of time and talent. All in all this movie will not be add to my collections... not ever as a bad example of a series ran dry of story and wide on special effects."
Unbearable and Forgettable. I could've done better,"Literally the moment I left the theater I tried to reconcile at least one scene but I couldn't. This is a blatant cash grab that has no business being made. Sam Raimi is, if we're all being honest, a terrible director and this is by far at his worst. Again, I cannot visualize, quote, or remember a scene from this trash.

I'm not even trolling or whatever. This is perhaps the worst movie ever made. ALL of the sets and characters are just these same ugly CGI meshes exactly like literally every other Marvel movie.

There is genuinely nothing appealing or good about this. Again, this movie is probably like 98% animated, but the animation is the exact same disgusting fantasy-real life hybrid garbage. I will not be seeing another Marvel movie in the future, theyre all the exact same yet critics and especially audiences just eat it up like candy."
"Oh, Wicked Wanda & Somewhat Doctor Strange",
WOW THIS WAS TRASH,"Ok DISNEY..... I am offically done with you. Selling my stock in your company too. You have DESTROYED the Marvel universe - it's over. COMPLETELY.

Wow this was soooooo bad there are no words to decribe it. One liner garbage lines, bad script overall, bad CGI villains, bad LITERALLY everything.

And btw PATRICK STEWART as Professor X is a COMIC MOVIE ICON. And you tried to do to him, what you tried to do to LUKE IN STAR WARS. BUT in the end, the fans are going to do that to you!

I cannot believe I am saying this but I officially dislike Disney and Kevin Feige as of today!"
SAM RAIMI IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS.,"Sam Raimi brought a new tone to the MCU, and it felt so different and good. It was handled so differently from all the other MCU movies but felt through and through like a really good comic book adaptation. It is so unique, weird, scary, and gory that it's one of the best MCU movies, in my opinion. What I do think could have been better was the run time. It could have given us more time to breathe and process what happened between scenes. But overall, this movie was such an experience!"
the poorest storyline in all marvel movies,"The plot is not convincing at all, very poor, I don't know who approved this poor plot.

There's some good fights and that's all.

And Wanda is tooooo OP.

And the trailer if full of lies."
Entertaining but expected more,
meh - full theater was underwhelmed,"Never a big fan of the comic. This reminded me of the first, OK but I won't buy it. Disney pushed their agenda with one couple in the whole movie, a pair of moms. Extra star for the cameos of the Illuminati (in the preview). It was fine but seemed very long. Only so many ""let's grunt and turn up the magic"" moments before I start to yawn."
Stan Lee we miss you!!,"This film just proves how important was Stan Lee and his ingenious story telling was critical to Marvel.

Marvel just spent millions of dollers to show a dodgeball match between Wanda and the rest of the cast with a Halloween backdrop.

It is no wonder the makers had to rely on over the top VFX as there is absolutely no coherent story to weave.

Money down the drain...dont even watch if someone shows it to you for free...."
Fantastic visuals and captivating story,"This film really has fantastic visual effects. The story is very good too, because it has got touching elements of family and love. The story also contains many surprises, and a few laughs too. I enjoyed this captivating journey right from the beginning to the end."
Avoid at all costs.,"This is probably one of the worst mainstream block-buster movies I've seen in my life (and I've seen a quite a bit). Occult fighting occult, with lot of magic, nonsense, non-logic and non-cheering for anyone (except the girl America Sanchez). By far the worst Marvel movie, after surprisingly excellent Multiverse flick ""Spiderman No Way Home"". Also, a lot of scary/gore/bloody scenes for a 13 year old to watch, this should be R rated. Unlike other Marvel or most action movies that makes you leave theater feeling satisfied, or just cozy, or just neutral, this one will leave you sorry for spent time and money. My 15 year old daughter who went to see it because she likes Marvel, resented herself why she didn't leave the theater during the movie (and I stayed for her sake)."
A New Low,"It seems that each Phase 4 project in the MCU is competing to be the worst project yet! The plot was pushed forward by contrivance after convenience. The characters were stupid when they weren't being self-contradictory. The action was devoid of stakes, as the film makers selectively made up and forgot magic powers to suit the visuals rather than the story. The theme falls flat on its face as the story seems too preoccupied with cameos and side characters to really focus on it. Aside from Elizabeth Olsen's stellar performance as Wanda/Scarlet Witch, there was nothing to enjoy in this film. Just cheap cgi visuals which often seemed undercooked. I can't blame director Sam Raimi, as the credits stated that it was a ""Kevin Feige production."" What happened to the MCU I loved?"
"Mad Cameos, Mad Fan Service, And Missing Full Story Magic","LIKES:

The Acting: When it comes to the performances, so many solid pieces came together to bring another solid performance in this Marvel installment. Ejiofor, when he is in it, enjoys a nice reprieve of his role, adding the same honor, mystery, and values that we got in the first, only with a little twist. He is funny, he makes a great banter, and he is timed well when he is used, leading to a great inclusion. Olsen hits hard in the emotional feels of this movie, taking what we loved in WandaVision and adding some more layers to help flesh it out, Olson takes the Scarlet Witch to new heights. Fans should enjoy the character development components with it, while relishing in the abilities that the strong character wields. The way she delivered the lines, the emotional flair, while also really bringing that edge to the combat skills. As for Cumberbatch, he's the man, and I really enjoyed the take he brings to Stephen Strange in this second installment. He's witty, he's elegant, and can be vulnerable, and he manages to bring all of it in a nice balance that we love to see in our characters. Strange is very interesting, relatable, but still holds the qualities of the comic character keeping true to the direction Disney took with him long ago. Everyone else hits their roles well, and there is fantastic chemistry amidst most of them to win my two thumbs up, but... there are better moments to this movie.

The Music: Danny Elfman always brings character to his work on movies, and this film is no exception. Strange's second feature has solid scores and remakes of Marvel themes and music you love to hear as they appear on screen with big reveals and moments. Props to whoever elevated the score to be utilized more than just background noise though, as the creativity with this music is top notch in how they take an already master score and make it have even more quality to it. That's all I can really say, so let's move on to.

The Fan Service/Revelations: If you are part of the Marvel fanbase, one of the biggest things that get you stoked is when your favorite references sneak their way into the movie. Good news, the movie is loaded with stuff that fans will go ape for, in their introduction in this film, none of which I can reveal without ruining the movie. Regardless, the movie opens up the potential for a lot of things to come in our Disney verse in the near future and I for one enjoyed what the Multiverse has brought with this film, and I can only wonder what other films will work their way into the next Phase of the film line up.

The Character Development/Emotion: It would not be Disney without some form of character moment put into the film, and again they succeeded in helping evolve the characters in their game of superhero tag. Strange himself has plenty of new avenues to explore, working towards the goal of growing in to a better person and sorcerer as he handles his ""demons."" While I did not tear up, I have to say there were some relevant arcs in this film that I respected, and enjoyed seeing those moments come to life in those deeper moments of the film.

The Action...To Some Degree: For fans like me, action is a big part of the movie and Strange managed to bring some awesome moments to take their place in the hall of MCU fame. Raimi elevated the stakes and the tone of these fights, and delivered some amazing moves that will have fans clapping in excitement. As mentioned in the music section, the spells offer new levels of magical chaos to partake in, and they make for some wicked bouts of spellcasting, at least in some of the fights. Strange certainly dips into the pools of strategy and creativity, using a lot of things for weapons as he combats the obstacles that are put before him. It's fun, it's exciting, and it works well to spice up the usual tactics to fighting we've seen in the other films, while still sticking to the comic books that we as fans enjoy. A solid bout of work there.

The Visuals By far, the best thing were the visuals and Strange's world once again really bringing the fantasy world to life as the journey through the dimensions unfolds. I'll admit, it's a bit CGI heavy, but Disney's budget has continued to help craft things we only dream about in mind or drawings with a decent realism to it. Want to see Strange portrayed in lots of artistic styles? You've got it in this film when they are going through the montage of Multiverse transitions. Want to see demons and monsters appear with their own horrific style? Again, this movie has managed to craft some great textures and animations to fight with. Want to see spells warp their way around in colorful arsenals and bend the fabrics of onscreen reality with some nice styles? I think I've made my point. In addition, the costumes, settings, and makeup they do at times are the thing cosplayers dream of owning, looking awesome as they once again bring our comic book worlds to life. A solid use of the technology and props, strange has loaded the MCU with plenty of service to animation and design to really get the cinema experience coming to life.

DISLIKES:

The Action to Some Other Degree: I like lots of the action, but I won't lie that there were some moments built up that did not deliver the punch I thought was coming. Dr. Strange had several fights with that suspense setting, the dark tone promising for fights that were going to have us on the edge of our seats. And yet, these moments sort of dropped to simple resolutions or kind of just dropped off, rather than hitting those sequences the first film did well at times. With the arsenal of spells at their fingertips, and the wisdom these fighters have, I had expected a little more time, dedication, and planning to unleash the full potential I wanted to see in this film. Not the worst, but certainly more fine tuning to really maximize on the MCU adventure.

The Visuals a Little Over CGI: We know that it takes a lot of computer power to make these worlds be realistic and often they succeed in keeping the balance between fake and real. However, the CGI was a little too heavy at times for this movie that the illusion was a little more separated than what we have seen. The worlds and spells take a little more of the too smooth or too perfect movement, that it approached the phony levels we sometimes see. Not the worst at all, but again, some more time smoothing elements out to really give it that finesse.

Some Characters Get to Shaft: You know from previous reviews that several big characters need to have their due if they are going to be built up. While this film accomplishes good use of the cameos and secondary roles, there are a few other people I feel needed more time to make their mark. Wong and Mordo are the two characters I find to be the most underutilized of the bunch when looking at the trailers. Sure, Wong has some okay screen time and some fantastic moments that show his powers, but there was more that could have been done to really give his involvement the full time in this hasty tale. As for Mordo, well, he's got his moments to be included, but don't let the trailers fool you... his involvement does not merit the full hype you might have. I can't say more than that, but this was a bit of a disappointment for me in the long run given what the trailers promised.

The Story: By far the messiest of the movie dislikes for me is the story. No, it's not a piece of crap or misconstrued confusion (at least most of it isn't). However, the movie does feel a little crammed with so many points that several of the things I mentioned where short changed due to this chaotic inclusion. Several twists were not really that surprising or timed well, dropping the truth in seconds rather than really drawing things out and establishing the mystery. Hasty ties to the shows made their quick appearance and then sort of pulsed out, while character development attempts were sort of just dropped to make room for more fan service. Other potential story elements that were supposed to be more intense again felt bland and sort of smudged in, while other promises made by the trailer, were startling limited in their inclusion and execution. Even the ending moments to get us set for the next film felt weaker and less mind blowing and okay, rather than getting me hyped for the next film. This was the weakest element and I think balance was lacking somewhat again for what was needed.

The VERDICT: Our second trip into the world of Strange was certainly an interesting ordeal that opens up the way for Disney's purchases to come home. Special effects wise, it's stunning, a masterpiece for the most part of that animation and adventure we love to see in a Marvel movie. Acting is great and the characters that get good time, have some decent dives into the character pool to help you appreciate their struggles. However, the movie is lacking balance like the last crossing of dimensions, that though has the darker edge many have looked for, lacks the finesse the other movies have. It's story in particular is the weakest element for me, the foundation shaky that other sacrifices and compromises were made to help try and cover the weaker plot. Fan service and cameos took precedence over story sustenance, and even the action was a bit underwhelming at times as the plot points crashed. Still, the movie has enough magic to warrant aa visit to the theater and hopefully it will be entertaining for you fans on other levels to forgive the rougher elements. Note: Kids of the Marvel series are warned for the darker elements of this movie.

My scores are: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0."
Doctor Strange vs. Evil Dead,"""Doctor Strange vs. Evil Dead"" should have been the right title. I love Doctor Strange but I don't like Evil Dead. So this Film is not working for me. I' m tired of MCU this time. It sucks in so many ways. This kind of horror is 80's style. It doesn't fit to the marvel cinematic universe at all. I have only one question: Why this unnecessary mashup? This is what it feels for me."
Not quite what I expected,
Absolute Garbage,"Messy, confused, conflicted, muddled. I could go on but just imagine I list of a load more adjectives like those. Marvel has lost its way. Kevin Feige's ego is now burning out of control. My prediction is a huge crash (and dose of reality) is coming for both him and Disney. In summary the movie is a great concept squandered & bungled by Fiege."
Dr. Strange franchise kills itself off with an insulting Meta-jumble,"Let me say I loved the first Cumberbatch version and had high hopes for this one.

Boy...hope in one hand and garbage in the other.

I stuck it out as long as I could (90 minutes) before I was compelled to stalk out of the theater.

How could Raimi allow this???

Red Witch...FAIL

Teeny girl...Fail

But the biggest fail was the INSULT to decent film writing. It isn't present; just millions and millions of dollars of CGI in place of a story or even a sensible plot. They managed a first though....""Jumping the Shark"" in multiple universes!

It is also INSULTING to turn all the other Marvel characters into little more than CLAY PIGEONS.

""Yeah, wild....we can really do something BOLD this time....we can kill off all the heroes.... BUT bring them back in the next movie!!!!""

I think the writer's conferences were heavily fueled with DMT instead of any skill.

I'll put a bet down.... Cumberbatch will never return no matter how much money they throw at him.

GARBAGE."
Another Cash Grabber Discombobulating Mess.,"Dare I say Enough Multiverse? - When Dr. Stephen Strange casts a forbidden spell which opens a pathway to the multiverse, a surprisingly early revealed villain that threatens humanity.

Yawn! Good vs. Evil in its idiocratic form. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is what you expect from a Disney/Marvel film, stunning CGI with a complete lack of any solid story or unique plot concept...A diarrhea of pointless 2 dimensional characters that don't hold themselves with a failed hint of darkness forcefully shoved by Sam Raimi to provide a sad attempt of maturity to a PG-13 movie.

Here's an idea for Disney...Not because you own Marvel and Star Wars means you MUST make a diarrhea of movies/series each year. 1 or 2 well planned, well written and well acted ones can make a huge difference cinematic wise and money wise too! That of course if you ever consider the viewers' opinions and if I dare say...respect their minds."
The MCU continues to impress,"What a great experience. So much craziness, so much madness. Similar to Spider-Man: No Way Home, I can't say much about the movie. It's best to go in without knowing anything, like I did (I don't watch trailers). What I will say is, I loved it and it's awesome.

The MCU continues to find a way to stay fresh, utilizing the multiverse and it's endless possibilities. This movie rewards those who have kept up with everything, which I love. This movie is more concerned with the fans than the casuals, WHICH I LOVE. This movie pushes the boundaries of PG-13 rather than catering to children... WHICH... I... LOVE (although I wish they would just go full R and simultaneously release PG-13 versions for the families).

My only flaw is that I thought the first half was better than the second half. It doesn't escalate as much as I would've liked. Although that may change on second viewing when I know what to expect. But I compare it to Spider-Man: No Way Home, in which the movie was beastly throughout, but then escalated to a new level during the last 40 minutes. I would rank MoM behind No Way Home and just behind the original Doctor Strange.

I have to give major props to the MCU. I'm not a fanboy (and there's nothing wrong with being one), I've never read a comic and my only exposure to Marvel is the 90s Spider-Man and X-Men cartoons. But I love movies and they continue to consistently give me great iterations with these great characters. I was worried that phase 4 would be a letdown after the amazing conclusion to phase 3, but almost every show and movie has been great since then, with the standouts for me being Shang-Chi, Loki, No Way Home, Moon Knight and now MoM. The MCU is too beastly. Keep up the great work! (3 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 5/5/2022, IMAX 5/16/2022, IMAX 5/25/2022)"
Please bring back Scott Derrickson!,
One of the worst MCU movies,One of the worst MCU movies made recently. What they really should've called this movie was the sequel to Wanda Vision. Let me start off by telling you how much I hated Wanda Vision and for them to make a movie basically based upon that is so discouraging to me. From the beginning to the end this movie was all over the place I can't express it anymore than that. I hated how they introduced the characters into this film. The movie felt like it was one big rush to get it finished.
"Marvel with too many universes and too little time. It's eye friendly, however.","""I'm sorry, Stephen. Your desecration of reality will not go unpunished."" Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor)

Well, thank you, Baron, but the punishment is exacted now with my trying to make sense of the messy multiverse of the new Marvel showcase, Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. It's as if Marvel called its prominent heroes for a conference, planned by the Marx Brothers, without a drop of humor.

Make no mistake, there is much for geeks here (my audience was packed with Marvel madness): gorgeous CGI, gorgeous Elizabeth Olsen (The Scarlet Witch, Wanda Maximoff, et al., just an uber sorceress), gorgeous Rachel McAdams (Dr. Christine Palmer and former Strange lover), and the chameleon actor, Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange). Should be enough to make a classic if there wasn't so much territory to cover in just over 2 hours. That's several universes, which also contain sinister duplicates of many characters. Too much goodness, too little time.

After Strange dabbles in a forbidden spell, he ushers in the multiverse with versions of himself too powerfully bad even for Strange, Maximoff, and Wong (Benedict Wong). This Marvel mess is aided by the usual Marvel tropes of power coming from hands and boulders shattering, together with warped cities, paint people, and so much more. Even the staple of most hero films, Wanda's search for family safety, is present with too little fanfare because it is the most affecting human endeavor of the film.

Director San Raimi has brought his chops from previous Spider Man episodes that successfully joined three Spider Men actors to more or less successfully join different characters; it is too unclear here the differences except for a third eye or two.

Although hope is here in the form of a new super-powered teen, America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), who can jump the universes with ease, she doesn't know how to use this power, and we don't have time to grow with her. Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is itself overgrown but still a mélange of images and ideas to spark the interest of comic book fans and critics up for the challenge."
"I was hoping for something as good as Spider-Man: No Way Home, it was closer to Morbius.","Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught last night in theatres. The storyline focuses on Wanda Vision who has lost her husband and dreams of having children. She decides to bend the multiverse and head to a world where she can be the mother she dreams of...but she needs a little girl's power to make it happen. A little girl has the ability to go anywhere in the multiverse she wants but doesn't know how to control her powers. Dr. Strange comes to the girl's aid to try and save her from Wanda Vision.

This movie is directed by Sam Raimi (Evil Dead) and stars Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek: Into the Darkness), Elizabeth Olsen (Wind River), Rachel McAdams (The Notebook), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) and Benedict Wong (Annihilation).

The storyline for this had a lot of potential and some fantastic characters and cameos. I even liked how Sam Raimi Raimi'd the end of this movie. The film does feel like it is missing something the entire movie though that prevents it from reaching its potential. There is a tremendous darkness and hopelessness that hangs over this movie and also some great kills. The settings, special effects and use of magic is pretty good. Olsen was a tremendous Scarlett Witch and as she got darker throughout the movie...so did the movie.

Going in I was hoping for something as good as Spider-Man: No Way Home, it was closer to Morbius. I would score this a 7/10 and recommend watching it once."
Silly,"So disappointing.. this movie is just silly, perhaps made solely for very young viewing only. Continuity was appalling for what use to be a high standard of movie making from the Marvel series. I think Sam Rami was a bad choice for directing this, it became Evil Dead meets Marvel Comic. To top it off, the sound was very low or off all together in the back of cinema at Event Cinemas, or it is a normal setting for the sound of this movie, if so, it's a massive flaw, my sound at home from my old amp and flat screen tv is better. I couldn't handle the silly boredom any longer, I left before the end I didn't care what was left or what was going to happen, which to be honest was totally predictable anyway. Only the second movie ever, that I needed to walk out of. Waste of money."
This is a disgrace,"Whoever's thinking about watching this movie, don't. Absolute garbage.

They've ruined everything they had built since the first Iron man came out. Burned it to the ground. I am utterly disappointed and shocked.

This made me never wanna watch another Marvel movie again. Ever.

I was so excited about this movie, I couldn't wait for it to come out. Now, I can't find words to describe how terrible this movie was. This has ruined my day."
Prepare to be ensorcelled...,"Initially then ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" was not a movie that I was planning to spend a cinema ticket admission on, but I ended up doing so any way, as I went to watch the movie with my family. And while I am not overly keen on superhero movies, then Marvel does tend to pump out entertaining movies, so I figured why not.

Regardless, then I would have ended up watching ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" any how, be it on streaming service down the road or in the cinema I suppose. And let me just be the first to say that writer Michael Waldron's 2022 take on the ""Dr. Strange"" character and storyline made it worth sitting down in the cinema to watch. The storyline told here was really good, in fact, it was actually the most enjoyable of all Marvel's movies so far for me. So thumbs up to writer Michael Waldron and director Sam Raimi for that accomplishment.

I really enjoyed the storyline told in ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"", as it was more than just another run-of-the-mill superhero movie where it is the main superhero against one or more villains. Sure, that element was also present here, but the storyline told here offered so much more than just that, in terms of character development, subplots and world building. And the whole thing with the Scarlett Witch was just spot on, I really loved that aspect of the storyline.

What worked so well here for me was a combination of the storyline, the acting performances, the visual effects and also the fact that ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" was so surreal and had some horror elements involved as well.

The cast ensemble in the movie was great. Benedict Cumberbatch definitely is so well-cast for the role of Dr. Stephen Strange. But Elizabeth Olson, in the role of Wanda Maximoff/Scarlett Witch, was just phenomenal, and she gave some much to the movie. Benedict Wong, in the role of Wong, also delivered a great performance for an interesting character. And I was just thrilled to see Bruce Campbell in small cameo role here in the movie, well two actually. I wasn't at all familiar with Xochitl Gomez, playing America Chavez, but she definitely spruced up the movie quite well with her energy and performance.

Visually then I was just blown backwards and bedazzled. The visual department worked great magic in ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"", and it was just pure eye-candy to witness all the special effects on the screen. And trust me, the visual effects here need to be enjoyed on the big screen, as does the audio effects.

I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" from director Sam Raimi, and I was pleasantly surprised with how appealing the movie turned out to be, despite of it being a superhero movie. For me, then ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" is definitely the best of Marvel movies out there so far.

My rating of ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" lands on a well-deserved eight out of ten stars."
What a missed opportunity looks like,"This was Marvels chance to explore the concept of the multiverse. Instead we got a 2 hour movie which tried too hard to have a horror/dark tone. All but 4 or 5 different universes were actually seen.

And the biggest letdown of all is this WAS supposed to be a Dr Strange movie and he is completely overshadowed by Wanda. This could have easily been a Wanda Maximoff standalone movie.

And the few multiverse characters you actually do see on screen get what? 2-3 mins of screen time?

I wish Marvel fans would stop being blinded by fan loyalty stop acting like this movie was good. It wasn't. If anything it could have been an animated special on Disney+ between the lack of direction and awful story."
Probably the worst marvel movie to date.,
The much needed change of pace,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness gives the MCU its much needed and biggest change of pace yet, a dark, genuinely tense and surprisingly violent film that finally restrains the trademark humour for a more thoughtful film about regret, choice and fate.

Benedict Cumberbatch has been consistently giving note perfect performances across the last few years of Marvel movies and it's really nice to have him back in a leading role again. Elizabeth Olsen gets to continue the more layered development of Wanda started in WandaVision in extremely satisfying ways.

Benedict Wong is still instantly loveable as Wong and Rachel McAdams increased screen time is much appreciated. Xochitl Gómez makes a great first impression with a charming and likeable character who's easy to root for.

Thankfully, Sam Raimi's unique voice and style have not been lost in the franchise's often bland filmmaking, instead delivering a film that's visually striking and kinetic in ways no other Marvel film has been. His horror roots are also on display in some very satisfying ways.

The action benefits greatly from the ridiculous inventiveness of it all so no fight feels lazy and generic. Danny Elfman's score is a definite standout, really unique and fun but isn't afraid to reference some classic Marvel themes in clever ways.

The film is only brought down by a collection of nitpicks at best. The CG has a few weak points despite being really impressive overall. The fast pace works really well but takes a scene or two to adjust and a few narrative beats may require a suspension of disbelief that's too much for some."
A Contrived Mish-Mash,
Sam Raimi could have done better if they gave him more wiggle room.,"So I heard that there were some reshoots that needed to be done before the movie came out. Very curious what they were. The movie starts off great, its fun and funny as we catch up with Stephen Strange far more than his role in spider-Man No Way Home. The action starts quickly which was great, but then we get to the point where I feel the movie gets loop sided.

A lot of scenes were stretched out and far too slow and what made that really bad was that these scenes were meaningless. If you went to see this movie with a die-hard marvel fan you probably think you miss something person picked up, but I'm telling you right now, a lot of scenes were slow for suspense that was not needed.

Then we had a lot of scenes that went by far too fast, and these scenes should have more meaning than they should. There was a reason why we went to see Multiverse of Madness and that reason could have had more meat. Yeah, it was awesome, but not on the three Spider-Men in one film big.

Speaking of Spider-man, there was a point in the flick in which Sam Rami does his thing to the point that I wish this movie was called Dr. Strange and the Evil Dead. I feel like I learned something about how a marvel movie was produced. It seemed obvious that this part of the movie was producer Kevin Feige developing the universe he created, while this part of the movie was the part in which Feige allowed Sam Raimi (the man showed Marvel how to make a superhero movie and thus the reason why Feige has a job) do what he does best, and of course this was the best part of the movie as Raimi put his stank on it, but I needed more of the funk.

Could have also used more Scarlet Witch then what was given. It does not hurt that for the Scarlet witch to truly work in this flick you needed to have scene WandaVison. That was kinda a flaw because of how important she was to the story. She just was not fanfare, that you really did not need to understand the movie. On top of that you kind of needed to see the other Disney + series What If? For the fan fare to truly hit you. Not that important but that fan fare is why a lot of people what to see this particular entry in the marvel cinematic universe, right?

Don't let me discourage you form seeing it. It's good, and I'm glad I saw it once, but it does not feel like something I going to want to watch 100 times before it leaves theatres."
Multiverse of DISAPPOINTMENT,Hype plunged from 10 to 4 in 20 minutes! Just typical marvel eye candy. Only thing new was abit of horror. Nothing more. Definitely you can use that 2 hours to do something better and you should!
I miss phase 3 so much,"This was an absolute disappointment. I highly doubt I'll be paying to see anymore marvel please 4 fodder.

The acting was poor, the casting was worse, and the story was so ridiculous because it had no boundaries. If everything is possible, then nothing is interesting, there are no consequences, drive, it's just infinite meaningless chaos."
Hmmm. Not what I was expecting.,Great visuals and acting from the cast but can't say I'm not disappointed. They tried bringing in so many characters to make future movies connect but by doing that the whole thing turned messy.
I liked it a lot,"I really liked this movie, I found it very entertaining, although the ending seemed a bit simple, the rest of the movie is incredible. The cameos that appear are amaizing, it blows your mind, especially their outcomes, very good."
What did I just watch.,The action parts were cool I'll say that but I just wanted to see more different types of superhero's throughout the multiverse. I've never been so disappointed.
Marvel goes a bit dark.,
Worth the ticket but mid- to low Marvel,"This movie was okay. It has a lot going for it, and I was jumping from joy at the end for a certain outcome which immediately raised my score with 1 point, but at the end of the day this was kinda disappointing.

The good is the cinematography and visuals which are, mostly, great. I actually saw the movie in 3D and that was trippy and worth it! I highly recommend seeing this movie in 3D. Everyone did a great acting job, except for Elizabeth Olsen of course - probably the worst casting choice in Marvel history. The very high, and weird, pace of the movie trickles out into a few pretty cool and good and horror-esque moments in the 3rd act with a couple of moments that are pretty gorey for a Disney superhero movie. We also get a few cool pretty nice fights, but sadly here the praise ends.

Where this movie fails is in the story. It is very, very, very thin. Perhaps some of the plot holes I saw actually wasn't plot holes, everything move so fast, but there are definitely a bunch of them.

They take the already thin story from Spiderman: No way home, and the nonsense story from Wandavision and mix it together in a psychedelic weirdness soup which never really amounts to anything. This mindtrip and very high pace of the movie is meant to cover this up, to make you not notice how badly told and how badly written this movie actually is.

Xochitl Gomez who does a great acting job, she is wonderful actually, but her character America Chavez is just thrown in there and with very little background story she becomes the McGuffin of the story. America is a very liberal very PC and very ""diverse"" character in the comics, so although I see people complain I did not mind that at all. She stays true to who she is in the comics, and I have no problem with that, it is the character here in this movie and how badly written she is that bothers me.

The jokes never land. I think I chuckled a bit once, the other attempts at ""marvel humor"" did not work, especially not in this type of movie.

I give the movie a couple of extra points for a marvellous post credit scene, and a few decently surprising cameo's. But in the end this is not that great of a movie, and we are also left with a few lingering questions. I think this is mid- to low Marvel. I give it a 5/10 but I will throw in 1 extra point for never having to see a certain character ever again, so 6/10.

If you follow Marvel and you like superhero movies, this is of course worth it. I was not unhappy, and I think my money was well spent, but this is not anything special. The first Dr Strange was a lot better.

--- review update

I just saw the movie again and I have to say it is even worse than I first thought. On second viewing the plot holes shine more, and you can clearly see that many more of the actors cannot do their jobs. The high speed of the movie, pacing completely off, make you not notice all the errors the first time around but seeing it again with this level of acting... oh my... a real travesty. And the illuminati scene with the poor casting choices and their horrible ""jokes"" was so cringe I could barely watch.

On my second viewing Elizabeth Olsen also get even worse... I did not think that would be possible, but here she really show us she is the worst actress in the entire MCU. And yes, that includes extras.

I need to lower my score significantly. This is top 5 worst Marvel movies for sure. It is not as boring as Black Panther or as horrible as Endgame was, but this is really, really bad. I will lower the score to 3/10."
Big waste of time and money,"Much ado about nothing really at all. I'd find a 120 minutes movie about my empty trash can more exhilarating. Random series of special effects should apparently be interesting. Im sorry. Think again. Acting? OMG, where? When? Did i miss something? Must have. I didn't see it."
It could've gone straight to Disney+,Decent movie nothing special nothing memorable. Basically a crazy lady trying to be with her non-existent children - and willing to destroy and kill a lot of people. Forget all the rumours. Just take this movie for what it is.
So dull,"This is by far the worst movie in the entire MCU. Plot holes. Actors who look bored. New characters introduced with no explanation. Dumb ""creatures"" which are supposed to be scary but look like something from the kids department of K-Mart. So-called madness that only occurs across three universes. An evil Scarlet Witch who decides to not be evil any longer because her kids cried.

This movie can be summed up in one word: horrible.

In Spider Man No Way Home Dr Strange tells Peter when he reverses the spell no one will remember Spider Man, including Dr Strange. Ten minutes into the movie and America Chivaz makes mention of the multi-verse and Dr Strange says he's familiar and proceeds to tell her about none other than Spider Man. What the actual?

If I hadn't paid $15 for my ticket I would have left the cinema."
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,
Should Have Been Called: Wanda Maximoff in the Multiverse of Madness,"This isn't a MCU film, it's a Sam Rami film. I was in cloud 9 especially at the very beginning of the movie with its impressive visuals and intense, insane action. I haven't seen of all MCU but I'm very familiar with their usual formula or story structure. Into the Multiverse of Madness takes a more refreshing approach with a lot of brutality, felt pre-Disney era, and the humor felt right. Rami managed to added in some of his horror elements in there (Drag Me to Hell vibes) but I wanted more but I digress. The ""short"" runtime doesn't feel short, it's evenly paced out with no rushed moments (I recommend watching or rewatching WandaVision prior). Obviously, Cumberbatch and especially Olsen stole the show with their masterly performances. And last but not least, the amazing, Sam Rami god I miss him and his unique but amazing craft. Appreciate the movie for what it is and not with your expectations."
Worst Marvel movie I've ever seen,I was so disappointed with this movie. It was boring and weird. By far the worst Marvel movie ever made. Marvel what were you thinking?? Do yourself a favour and don't waste your time. I couldn't wait for the movie to end.
The real reasons some countries banned this movie,"Those countries who banned this movie are the lucky ones, possibly the real reason is that it sucks big time !

So I went in with great expectations, firstly because I absolutely loved the first Dr Strange movie and secondly because I consider both Benedict Cumberbacht and Elizabeth Olsen as very fine actors.

Unfortunately, the movie ended up a huge disappointment, the plot and characters were poorly developed, there was a lack of tension and lack of stakes for our heroes to over come.

So many forced emotional scenes and clichés in the movie which failed to make us connect.

I did not care about whether or not Dr Strange saved the day, I cared even less about American Chavez, she lacked any depth, and the actress playing her is just awful.

We were also supposed to somehow connect with Wanda and feel for her, which was again a complete failure and supposedly we should have felt some emotions to her two annoying kids, I basically did not care at all about the characters or their motives.

They tried playing with several emotions from audiences, American Chavez and her dilemma, Wanda and her dreams of kids, Dr Strange and his girlfriend, all felt flat and empty.

The usual Marvel jokes were also lame and forced.

As mentioned I was excited about at least having good performances from top actors, sadly, they all felt flat! I really don't know why, possibly because of the poor writing and worst dialogue. Also, emotional display without connection to the viewer ultimately led to failure.

Special effects and action were decent but nothing mind blowing, some intense and sort of scary scenes were forced upon us in an attempt to create a special atmosphere but failed as well, perhaps for the 7 to 9 years old viewers it might work.

Such a let down, to those people who live in a country which banned the movie, don't sweat about it, you're not missing anything special, in fact you're lucky as this to me is the worst Marvel Movie I've seen in a while.

Who knows, this whole banning story could b a desperate marketing attempt as well.

I think Disney just blew it, it feels like a kid's movie, probably ages 7 to 13 would enjoy this, but not for the mature and intelligent audience.

I think I'm done with Marvel and Superhero movies, it's becoming over saturated."
Elizabeth Olson and Raimi shine in a fun and exciting sequel,"Being a huge fan of the first Doctor Strange film, one that definitely didn't get enough attention in my opinion, and legendary director Sam Raimi- it was clear to me that Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was gonna be one hell of a ride- and thank god it was. The film is rather loose with its story, but it also provides a anti-typical narrative that does prove to be quite interesting and quite different than the usual Marvel schlock we have come to see from more recent films like Black Widow- though never being as pretentious or lengthy as Marvel Eternals. Where Multiverse of Madness works and the other fails, is its ability to take its audience fully into the insane experience at hand, never letting go for a second and devoting its all to every crazy moment it can. The acting is great, as I expected, Benedict Cumberbatch is again great as Doctor Strange- but even with him being the titular character- it's very clear that Elizabeth Olson as Wanda or ""The Scarlet Witch"" is clearly the biggest standout in the film altogether. Olson ties the film together in a way I didn't expect, and ties the film to a rather emotional and psychological core that is sure to please all fans of her character and devoted fans of the show WandaVision. In addition to Olson and Cumberbatch, the supporting cast also does great, especially newcomer Xochitl Gomez and the returning Rachel McAdams. The cameos can be a bit underwhelming, nothing too special or grand as some other projects. The visuals are often incredible, and thanks to Raimi's signature style- brilliantly dark and even gothic at times- and the special effects are often fun and vibrant- although it is quite silly to see that half done photoshopped eye on Doctor Strange a few times. The music is honestly fantastic, a brilliant score from genius Danny Elfman, both haunting and exciting in the best possible way. In the end, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness may not be as even or brilliant as the original- but it does a great job of enrapturing us in new worlds and embracing us in grand new ways with the characters we have grown to love- and some new ones as well.

My Rating: 9.3/10."
"Another fake rate Blockbuster! Talking too much, and full of annoying overuse scene! Another big letdown!",
Demand your refund,"Hey, when a movie is as bad as this - demand a ticket refund. If you leave within the first half of the movie, you should ask for refund. ( I always get my refund )

Only if enough dissatisfied customers hit them in the wallet, will they stop making this kind of grot.

And get a tripod! Please stop the jerky cam, shaky cam, and unwatchable fight scenes."
A steaming pile of madness,"Rubbish stuff, boring story. It's just Wanda vision 2. Why couldn't the come up with a proper bad guy. And full of forced woke rubbish too. Aviod it, there's better stuff to watch."
A STEP AWAY FROM A HORROR FILM,
Didnt make much sense,
It's getting worse...,
A Curious Conjuring of Necromancing Nihilism...,"Doctor Strange is increasingly estranged, from Wanda whose increasingly deranged, through parallel portals and gaping wide plot falls, many flaws to explore through perpetual change.

Just not quite as good as I'd hoped it would be."
Not Sure If I Like Where The MCU is Going,
Worst Marvel movie ever,"Normally, I really enjoy Marvel movies. This movie is the complete antithesis of most Marvel movies. The plot line is sophmoric. The fight scenes are just silly and the entire movie is so predictable it's annoying. Anyone giving this movie an 8 or above is a total Marvel sychofant. My three boys all said it was a 5 at best. There are so many inconsistencies and nonsensical things going on in this movie that it drove me crazy. The writers really mailed it in on this one."
LOL - who let this get released,"Maybe it's marvel fatigue but that was an awful movie. Audibly laughed at some of the dialogue and acting was so poor. Still have no idea how Amerika fit into the story, one of the weakest plots in any movie I've seen.

Jeez that was bad."
Wanda's lipstick game was only thing stong in a mess,"Wanda's commitment to perfect lipstick is admirable , the rest of the movie is a white hot mess of stunning visuals and inept story, felt more like a wanda movie with a cameo by dr strange."
Total Garbage,It was not good. I thought Eternals was awful but this was much much worse. There was no redeeming qualities and I would not recommend this to anyone.
Worst movie from Marvel. Please SAM step down!,"Being a die-hard Marvel fan, I feel shame in recommending this movie to any of my friend.

The gore content in the movie which was very disturbing for young generation even when they are 14 or 15.

The whole film felt like a third class, poorly directed horror movie from cheap production house.

Please stop this torture with Marvel and stop making the awfully bad films!"
"Wanda 1, Not Dr Strange 2","Once again Disney plays the old switcheroo on us. We thought we were getting a Dr Strange movie but its WandaVision 2 (but minus Vision, he gets zero mentions). Make no mistake, she's the star here, followed by America Chavez (lol I'm not kidding) and then Wong, then Dr Strange.

Its ironic cause Kenobi is doing the exact same thing, it's a series for their character Reeva, not Obi-wan or Anakin. But thankfully people are starting to see thru this corporate greed.

Oh, and its a terrible movie with a terrible story and terrible CGI. Pass."
Terrible film but a lot of effort put into it...,"The good bits. I really enjoyed the first film. It made you look through the physical world in a different way. You also had thought provoking characters, eg. Dr Strange who is arrogant, reckless, sensible and likeable all at the same time. This film kept some of that magic. It certainly positions itself as the more open minded franchise of the Marvel Universe. Also, the special effects were excellent... they really got peoples' movements downpat.

However, that's the extent of the good bits. I really could not relate to these characters at all. Their behaviours were all odd, except probably Christine Palmer. I was struggling to relate to anyone. The best comparison I can give is ""watching Days of Our Lives"" with exaggerated dialogue, exaggerated mannerisms, shallow motives, etc. I couldn't care if anyone lived or died... I couldn't even root for the villain whose logic was so far removed from common sense that I hoped the villain died too. Doctor Strange lost his mojo. He was boring and played second fiddle to other characters. It was his worst performance I've seen from Cumberbatch.

In all seriousness, this was probably one of the worst films I've seen. I strongly disliked the characters and the story had no soul to it. The motives were absurd.

I don't recommend this film to anyone except for those who love great effects and don't care about characters. The effects were superb. It's just not enough to carry a film across the line. The story needs to focus on personality. This film clearly had other priorities. That didn't kill the film... it was just another distraction."
Thoroughly enjoyed,Seems like this is one of the more divisive MCU films but I had a good time watching. Graphics were amazing as were the cameos. Can't wait to watch again on Disney+
I'm seriously upset,
Not impressed,"This movie is very dark, not only in scenery but in content and story line. Seems like Disney is straying from moral good to Darth Vader in much of their movies now. Typical of Hollywoood Elites. They've created a Wanda whom was a reasonably good person to what is now a wicked witch character like Thanos was. Too bad! So no more redemption or good examples? I'm done with Disney stuff. This is just my opinion but is this good for this generation that is growing up?"
There are no stories in the Multiverse,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness reminds me amazingly the old Batman TV Show with Adam West. Crash, Boom, Bang! No story, but a lot of colors and fun. I consider Doctor Strange 1 as one of the best Marvel Movies in the MCU so far. And I still do. This one is boring, the characters are not existing, they are always fighting and the fights are repeating and repeating. Benedict Cumberbatch, please, try a new Season of Sherlock, stop this madness, please!"
Pushes the boundaries for the MCU,"Imperfect execution in the 3rd act but undeniably unique with its horror themes, multiverse concepts, & cinematography. Very violent with excellent character development & emotional weight."
Doctor Strange in the Marvelverse of Mehness.,"There's something off about pretty much every aspect of 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)'. In fact, it doesn't even feel like a film. Nobody seems as though they're in the same room, several of the actors clearly don't want to be there, the editing is often bizarrely choppy, the story is all over the place (and usually feels more like an excuse to include various cameos, callbacks and sequel teases than an actual narrative), the attempts at character development are superficial, and - despite some compellingly creepy and gooey imagery - the visuals often look like something straight out of 'The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D (2004)'. A lot of the movie amounts to blatant exposition, most of which is only relevant to previous or upcoming films, and this stuff is pretty much always genuinely boring. When things do kick into gear, the action is generally disjointed and floaty. The most satisfying moments occur when a couple of characters go hand-to-hand, likely because you can tell that two people were actually in the same room at the time of filming, but most of what's supposed to be exciting simply falls flat. That's largely due to the fact that the characters are all so dull that it's hard to care about any of them. There are attempts at creating depth here and there, but these feel so tacked-on that the majority aren't even thematically relevant and their eventual conclusions inspire nothing more than a sigh. Benedicts Cumberbatch and Wong are as enjoyable as ever under the circumstances, while Elizabeth Olsen does her best with material that by-and-large butchers her character. Almost all of the fewer-than-anticipated cameos amount to throwaway gags performed by people who sound like they read their lines for the first time just moments before the camera started rolling and, in some cases, aren't even wearing an actual costume (this parody is legitimately better than the cameos it's based on). The best walk-on part is that of an old friend of the Raimi family and even that's a total non sequitur that's only enjoyable due to its blatant absurdity. Apparently, the story was in constant flux (no surprise given the picture's heavily-reported reshoots) and the ending was figured out halfway through production. In all honesty, it shows; this flick is one heck of a mess. I mean, this review is more structured and it's little more than an agitated ramble. Though Raimi manages to sneak in some enjoyable direction every once in a while, the majority of the piece is bland and intangible. Plus, outside of a brief montage showcasing a variety of increasingly ludicrous - and therefore interesting - universes, the picture takes place in the most basic alternate realities imaginable, completely wasting its premise in the process. The movie's enigmatically schlocky title totally oversells the actual affair, as there's very little madness to this particular multiverse. Really, the experience is totally outshone by 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)', in terms of both visuals and narrative. Heck, even 'Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)', a feature that suffers from some of the same problems as this, blows it out of the water, primarily because it remembers to attach actual characters to its cameos and ensures that even its most surface-level references are enjoyable to some degree. I feel a bit sorry for Raimi, actually; he swapped the studio meddling of Sony for the studio stifling of Marvel. Given the chance, I'm fairly confident he could come up with a weird and wonderful take on the eponymous character and his escapades through an infinite amount of alternate realities. Marvel still isn't letting their directors do their own thing, though. No matter how hard they try to hide it, there's no mistaking the calculated hand of Kevin Feige pulling the strings. As I mentioned up top, 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)' doesn't even feel like a real film. Instead, it plays like a checklist of things nobody asked for. It admittedly gets more entertaining as it goes along and there are a handful of sequences which are appropriately Raimi-esque. These scenes, which mostly deal in horror-infused action, can be fairly fun (notably those towards the end of the affair). Plus, the lead actors lend credence to the generally weak (and occasionally terrible) screenplay. However, the film's all-too-brief best moments are still hampered by some seriously iffy editing and the fact that the narrative typically fails to do anything even remotely engaging. Also, like in the similarly disappointing 'Eternals (2021)', the insipid post-credits scenes are blatant parodies of themselves. The whole thing just stinks of wasted potential, really. Surely there's a much better version of this somewhere in the multiverse of our own, but sadly we'll never get to see it."
Terrible,"Bad CGI, bad acting, terrible story. Terrible actors who are just reading the script.

It just doesn't gel together and once you work out one complicated part of the script, another appears.

Need I say more?

Stick with Spider-Man."
Just Plain Old Boring,"Actors - boring, Story - boring, Action - fake and boring. Let me apologize firstly since I have been such a great fan of comic books my whole life. But, it seems to me that whoever is making these movies just seems to think that they have the recipe for a profit (they do) and this recipe should not change by to much. Lots of CGI, lots of bad acting, lots or bad jokes and just another remake of what seems to be the same movie, the same movie, the same movie - oops, i got stuck in a loop - much like the movie industry. I mean how many Wolverines is to many? How many Dead Pools, and please don't get me started on Aquaman - what a waste. Well, it pains me to say this but I am looking for to seeing a movie without any CGI and with actors that can act. I mean seriously, Lisa Bonnets husband was bad in Game of Thrones, he aint getting any better, nor are the stories. I am done with these movies."
Another travesty of a MCU film.,
The woke-verse,"If there is a universe where wokeness controls our marvel movies then here it is. The whole movie just screams agenda. Disney please, remember that Stan Lee made these heroes to exemplify heroism and bravery."
A Blast from Start to Finish,"I very much enjoyed the first Doctor Strange film and thought his character has made a nice progression thus far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With the events of Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, WandaVision, and Spider-Man: No Way Home, I was slightly concerned about this film being able to stand on its own. Now here's the thing, it doesn't, but I still thought it was great. In fact, I think it's an even more entertaining film than the first Doctor Strange. I would even go as far as saying it would be in my conversation of the better Marvel Cinematic Universe films. Here's why, as long as you're caught up on the connected properties, this one is more than worth your time.

Picking up after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home and WandaVision, both of which laid the groundwork for how the multiverse is talked about in this film, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness takes no time at all before it dives right into the action/madness. If for nothing else, I loved the pace. The film spends just enough time in the first few minutes to establish where relations are with other characters from the first Doctor Strange, but very quickly sets up how and why the multiverse is the mainline throughout the film. Without giving anything away, the reason the multiverse becomes the main plot is due to the character of Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen). Her presence here was electric and I couldn't get enough of it, but I can't go into any details without ruining her story here.

With the introduction of a new character in America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) very early on in the film, it becomes clear that she will be a staple in future films for sure. I'm okay with that because her performance here, along with her arc throughout the film, was all engaging to me. Her abilities and how she has them needs to be explored a little further in the future, but she was a very interesting character. Her interactions with Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) throughout the film were great as well. They share some great chemistry together. With all of that said, let's dive into a couple of minor issues I think some fans may have.

There has been a lot of hype surrounding big cameos and appearances from familiar faces, and while there is definitely a small chunk of the film dedicated to just that, I can see why people are saying this film was overhyped. Personally, I didn't know too much going into it, so I was very surprised by a couple of appearances. Still, where I feel people will be disappointed is in the fact that the multiverse itself remains focused solely on Wanda and Strange throughout the entire film. A lot more could've been explored, but I found that holding back made for a better overall film. There are some fun cameos for sure, but I think they went as far as they needed to. This film benefitted from not being bogged down by needless multiverse stuff. Plus, I believe this is still just the beginning of what kind of wacky adventures are coming in the next few films.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness didn't blow my mind in ways I was thinking it would, but it was also much more of a focussed story and used the fun cameos for a purpose in a way I wasn't expecting either. This film was great in my opinion. Yes, you do need to see a few other Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to fully enjoy everything on display here, but it's worth it. I just had a blast with it from start to finish. Sam Raimi, who directed this film, has his vision on full display here and being a fan of his work for many years, that put a smile on my face. There are a few thrilling scenes that border on a bit of horror and that was also nice to see. Although other films/series have delved into the multiverse already, this film felt like a breath of fresh air for the franchise. It's not perfect and I have some nitpicks with certain things, but I loved watching it."
"""Are you Happy?"" - I Wish I was!",
What a waste of time it was,Very boring and no proper script.. it was a real waste of time.. don't waste your money on this movie it is worst experience.. may be the movie must be good in some other universe not in this universe.
Disappointing direction,"I wish that Disney would focus more on good writing and developing good, memorable character stories instead of these factory-made, over-crowded films trying to repeat the Endgame formula of packing the screen with countless forgettable characters (that worked so well for the Boba Fett series.) I would have preferred that this was more about Doctor Strange and his story, but this was more about Scarlet Witch as the all powerful end all of the film. No more Disney, no more."
Dr Strange = Evil Dead 4 ffs!,"If you've ever seen Army of Darkness, then you've already seen this movie. Complete with Bruce Campbell and a book of evil. At least Army of Darkness had some cheap charm to its comedic style; this is just that movie remade with a Marvel budget."
A complete waste of an amazing cast and director,"I can't begin to describe how bad this film is. It ruins beloved characters. Its less than 2 hours yet drags on forever. The fights were cgi cluster messes and the usual MCU humour was absent, and the few jokes were really poor. Nothing interesting happens.

Also the plot... what plot? Its scene after scene of characters spouting exposition.

This film should have been a fun thrill ride through the multiverse. But instead its a mess."
New Marvel superhero: The Illumawhatti,"I didn't have high expectations with all of critics slamming this film, but I was actually thoroughly surprised and entertained at how well made this film was.

For starters, the S/VFX were the best I've seen so far in any superhero film. The dazzling and pop-out colorful CGI need to be appreciated at least on a huge IMAX screen. The story for me actually was very coherent and flowed very nicely, albeit still too long at 126 mins, yet just right compared to the almost 3+ hour long past superhero films. The story was a little monotonous, but at least wasn't convoluted. I did want some more laughs that lacked compared to previous Marvel films, like the Illumawhatti comment. Yet still, it was entertaining, thanks mostly in part to Gomez and Cumberbatch's chemistry and excellent performances. However, I did feel that Olsen's performance lacked realism and conviction, and felt more like a called-in performance.

Nevertheless, a great and unique story, with spot-on teaser end-credits scenes that enticed me to look forward to what's next in the MCU, and made me laugh out loud when the final scene showed the vendor. A well deserved 8/10 from me."
Honestly I just found myself very bored throughout the whole thing,
Multiverse of lackluster storytelling,
Some of the worst writing I've ever seen.,
Not what I was expecting.,"This movie lacked the charm of the first one and Dr. Strange really was a movie that I enjoyed the first round of. I just couldnt' get around the ridiculous plot of what would turn Wanda dark. Doctor Strange is like a background character in this movie. It carries his name but this movie is mainly about Wanda. This would be great if they just called this ""The Scarlett Witch's Multiverse of Madness"" and it would have been fine. The way this film is written it's 35% about Doctor Strange and 65% about Wanda.

This would have been better as a Disney series. Broken up into episodes. As a movie it's like sipping flat soda. It has all the flair but it's substance isn't there. This is a beautiful movie with great special effects but the plot is uninteresting. It stars a character (America) that you have no reason to care about (she's a minor comic book character) and Dr. Strange (who you came to see but it's not about him) and Wanda Maximoff (who finally reveals how powerful she is all too late since this is post Thanos) who has the most ridiculous plot device to let her powers emerge.

This whole movie to me was just based around a bad plot. It would have been so much better if she was trying to revive Vision or find the Yellow powerstone in another universe to recreate him but that's not it. She's doing all these to connect with the fake kids she created in Wanda Vision. Imagine a whole movie with that plot and try to imagine people not being annoyed."
Pure garbage,"From the very beginning to 25 min in to the movie... and then it gets worse.

Scarlett Witch comes in a grey cloud, then the next second its sunshine and blue skies... its like they don´t even try to do their job anymore and care about other than profit.

No real plot and no suspense in this garbage movie what so ever.

Some say its better than endgame... are you kidding me?

This is so bad, that its time to stop making more avengers movies or just marvel movies ever again."
Very mixed feelings about this one....,
Expect dissapointment and still you will get dissapointed,Acting 7/10( for the most parts the acting was good and the actors did justice for their roles) Visuals 7/10 (its the multiverse so the visuals are good) Storyline 1/10 (actually 0 but there was a story that is why the 1) Music 2/10 ( does not natch the scenes at all) Directing 2/10 Producing 3/10 Overall 3.7/10.
Dissapointing Sequel,"The first Doctor Strange was much better, had a nice origin story, taking it's time to let us know the main characters and the connection between them and even some decent laughs here and there.

Multiverse of Madness however is a complete mess. Sam Raimi brings his usual team (Bruce Campbell cameo, composer Danny Elfman, make up artists) but it feels recycled and too familiar unless you're a young viewer which is not familiar with his past work.

The Story is all over the place involving woke elements, cameos which are hinting at the future of MCU and lots of cgi which might be an eye candy but gets tiresome especially in the poor last act."
"Sorry, but this one misses.","It was a disappointment for sure. Cumberbatch is always great, but he is overshadowed in this film by lesser characters. The villian doesn't make any sense, there is far too much woke girl power, the stakes are muddled, the characters fall flat and the action is cheap. This film made me miss Tony Stark working in his basement. I'm officially done with this multiverse crap. Time to regroup the Avengers and get back to basics."
Kinda Really Dumb!,"It's hard to explain how bad and twisted this story is. There is no point for this movie being made, other than getting fans to shell out a lot of money for a story that doesn't make sense. I anticipate the 3rd film will be twice as bad."
Marvel is tired of DC hogging all the bad reviews,"A bad story released to show everyone how woke the MCU can be, plus demons, zombies, and other Halloween themes. I feel cheated. Any way the review has to be longer so wokeity, woke, with a side of wokeness."
Weak writing and directing,"The movie felt like a cheap children's TV show, but with A LOT of money thrown into CGI.

It is almost like Marvel had never actually made any movies before... Remember Winter Soldier ? Iron Man ? Avengers ?

What the hell happened, Marvel ?

It is just embarrassing for your whole company, to create such bad movies...

If you can't even teach a girl how to throw a convincing punch, can't write a clever move for the SMARTEST MAN IN THE WORLD, so that he could be instead used as cheap fodder to create a scene of only women fighting for no reason, but you can make the acting of the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch look bad, you really have a problem."
America Chavez in the Multiverse of Madness,
"Campy, bold, messy and crazy","This film will not be for everyone however I really enjoyed it for what it is. Whilst it certainly won't live up to most peoples expectations at its core this is very much an enjoyable, fun horror flick. This film has some of the most distrubing content marvel has prodeuced with several jumpascares and horror imagery. This film bleeds Sam Raimi and thats a good thing this film is a breath in fresh air it feels like Sam Raimi has control over everything for better and worse. He is able to elevate what is a simplistic script to knew levels. The acting was amazing from every one here especially from Olsen and Cumberbatch.

The most frustrating part of this movie for me is the character assassination of Wanda her intentions come across as weak and it's hard to believe this is the same character I watched watching Wandavision. It's clear the writer has a certain view on this character influenced by the comics but it undoes all the hard work schaffer put into writing wandavision."
Worst movie I've seen in a long time,"The two hours felt like a complete parody of a Marvel movie. From the editing to the music to the acting; everything was just cheesy and laughable. Multiple people in our theatre started laughing at parts that weren't even meant to be funny just because of how awful it was. It's so disappointing too because the concept was interesting and the actors are typically great.

Almost everything about it was just cringe-worthy and unwatchable. Don't waste your money seeing it in theatres."
I wish I hadn't watched it.,"This is a waste of money in all matters. Just a lame reunion of characters on which the only ones missing were Elmo and Big Bird.

I fell asleep somewhere in the middle for some minutes and woke up and it was just the same chaos of film from where I had left."
Superb visuals can't compensate for a slender story,"I'll start with a note about the certificate. This is a 12A in the UK. There are a lot of extended horror-inspired scenes (with director Sam Raimi clearly going back to his roots). My 13yo and 15yo were both surprised by how intense this is at times. Younger children may well find it downright scary.

Now onto the film. Visually and sonically it is spectacular. A creative tour de force that the technical teams should be very proud of.

But that's it's problem. It's just a technical success. The story (and most importantly the characterisations) are really thin.

Now I'll confess that I always have a problem with superhero films that fall into the ""most powerful being in the universe"" trope. As soon as someone is that powerful, all tension disappears. They can just destroy everything if they want to, after all, so why are they messing around with endless force-field battles with one another?

You just end up with two hours of all-powerful beings jumping from universe to universe and engaging in increasingly boring conversations about the multiverse and the power of witchcraft. With the action/horror sequences getting increasingly silly as time goes on.

It does sort-of tie in with Wandavision and it does have a sequence in the middle that is clearly aimed at Marvel superfans, so if you are fully signed up to the franchise you'll get more from it than I did.

But as a casual filmgoer it is disappointing. An exercise in pure fantasy that doesn't have the relatable charm of other post-snap productions like Shang-Chi or Black Widow."
The saddest version in the multiverse,"Cheesy dialogue.. half wit plot with no punches.. And If that's not enough.. Then you're into a version (in the multiverse) that focuses only on pushing all the cultural junk in one society down your throat. And yes, we all threw up.

I wish this movie was banned in my country.

Also, I wish it all ended with Thanos's snap in Avengers: Infinity War. Only he foresaw what pile humanity would sink into and decided to save us from ourselves."
Disappointing and Messy,
The Scarlet Witch in the Multiverse of Melodrama,
"terrible plot, characters and directing","Except for captain marvel i was never so disengaged when watching marvel. I didn't care about characters, action was forced to put as many cgi's and battles as possible, decisions made no sense, movie was filled with silly and broken fan service.

New character was just silly all the way.. Wanda acted poorly and had idiotic motive.

Huge disappointment. I was with marvel from beginning but recently after poor tv shows i don't want to see their new ""ideas"""
Bazaaaaar Movie,"Part one was an icon, part Two is Trash. I gave one star and it is Waaaaaaay too much for this movie, very disappointed, they could pick away better story for the part 2 . What a waste of time."
Brilliant crazy Madness,"Sam Raimi hits the mark on his return with the Multiverse of Madness version of Doctor strange. With so many elements to the movie, it was so easy to have screwed this up big time but I felt this was a perfect mixture of everything. Horror as a genre makes its way into Marvel world through this one. Loved both Cumberbatch and Olsens performances in this one. A must watch and an apt follow up on the multiverse world."
Too many multiverse movies,
Doctor Strange in the Wandavision,"Not the most perfect, but definitely among the more stylish of the MCU, which I applaud very much. Raimi's obscure camera angles brings us into the deep, dark depths of sorcery, and in a way shows us a new side of what ""with great power comes great responsibility"" means by using two different characters battling it out while taking audiences on a ride through universes that visually remind audiences what going to comic book movies are all about."
It's a Good Movie,"When I watch it first time I found the movie mediocre. A few days later decided watch it again. I think it's pretty good movie.

I see some reviewers didn't like the movie at all. I think the problem occurs by the movie is fast pace movie. Most of details are missing when you first watch the movie. I like the acting, story, also directing. Maybe costumes must have been more detailed can't say significantly wrong about this movie."
Utterly disastrous,"Take this from someone who isn't a fan of the franchise who saw it when being premiered with no spoilers, in 3D and dubbed to Spanish. In all honesty, the movie is plain bad. The premise is absurd and so is the outcome, but hey at least they were consistent at that; the jokes seemed too cheap and insipid - probably seemed better inside their heads; the story, much too weak couldn't even stick together comes off as maimed either too rushed or too changy with lots happening too fast with no good transition; the 3D was horrid - hope it was just us and not the movie otherwise the experience must have been terrible for everyone, easily the worst 3D effect I've seen as the green screen practically swallowed even the actors and no talking about the visual effects. To be fair, the sound effects were beyond superb and probably the thing I enjoyed the most throughout the movie, kudos to the team. Aside from all that, the dubbing was just no good and could have been done much better taking into consideration the magnitude of the investment.

PS. As stated before, I am no fan of the franchise and I watched the film in Spanish because I was invited to come along, heck I would have watched it in Chinese if a friend asked."
Disappointing.,"I guess it's not awful and the acting is always going to be great with such a cast like that.

It just didn't feel like much of a game-changer as it was hyped up to be. Dr Strange 1 was better."
STRAIGHT UP MADNESS!,Doctor strange In the multiverse of madness is a fun messy mcu film which follows the adventures of dr strange and Wanda trying to save the multiverse from a threat. Now I can't say much about this movie but I can say it's an amazing film with beautiful shots and visuals and is an extremely well directed film ! Thanks Sam raimi . Though the writing is a bit sloppy and messy at times in the movie most of the dialogue is pretty good. Some parts are very messy and I feel like they cut this movie way too short. I still very much enjoyed it but the thing that stood out to me is Sam raimi. He uses horror elements from such movies as evil dead . It's the first horror movie in the mcu which is amazing. It's also the most gruesome entry in the mcu so don't think of bringing your kids there. Keep your expectations in check or else you will enjoy it less. Pls don't get spoiled on Internet because the surprises and cameos are truly mind blowing. With the flaws that doctor strange in the multiverse of madness carries it still stands out to be one of the mcu's best entries yet. This is my 5th favourite marvel movie. I give it a 9/10 .
Not the crossover event I was expecting,
Its carved in stone,
Multiverse of green screen non-sense,"Marvel/Disney continue their streak of mediocrity and plotless movies. After Russo brothers and the Infinity saga, they keep delivering below average. Spiderman No Way Home was saved by nostalgia, but there was no saviour for this mess.

They keep serving us the same green-screened movies with some cool visuals and trick the fans with cameos and new promising characters (and actors who are allured by the fat paychecks). In this movie, the multiverse characters serve absolutely nothing in the movie plot. They are just there for 5-10 mins and they are completely wasted.

They also present conveniently key elements for the movie without any prior reference to them (magic books, magic mountains, magic creatures, magic artifacts)

I bet Benedict Cumberbatch spent the entire filming moving entlessly his hands in circles while fastened within some ropes from the studio ceiling.

PS : Why Wanda didnt go out dating, find a decent (non-robot guy) and give birth to her own real children instead of messing the multiverse ?

PS2 : Where was the father (Vision) it the other universes ?

PS3: Where was sorcerer supreme while Wanda was messing with Westview and Darkhold ?

PS4: Too many questions (and plotholes) , so few universes."
"""Este güey no sabe español?""","1st : Highly recommend watching Wanda+Vision. Knowing what happened in Spider-Man's latest entry helps.

2nd : Has a few elements that force you to consider watching early, if you don't want to step away from the internet and the inevitable spoilers! Although they don't really add much to the core story of the movie, aside from being a set-piece and a ""bump on the road"". Noticeably fabricated to make people talk and want to watch.

Anyway, I'm conflicted!

It's definitely worth a watch if you still care about this universe. It's well crafted, acted and shot (some interesting camera angles here and there)! They properly told the story they wanted to tell (it being great is another story).

At the same time, many things left me wanting more. While it isn't as ""skippable"" as Eternals or Cap Marvel, and doesn't follow the known formula.. I'm not interested in watching it again any time soon! Maybe it's my fault for expecting more. I would have liked the NEXT step in the evolution of Dr Strange, and less of the ""same"".

MAGIC & PROGRESS - What do I mean by same-y? It feels like there has been little progress in the mage's skills, as if we are continuing exactly from where we left off. Magic is used sparsely and with limited results. I would expect our Doctor Strange to feel powerful at this point! But it's like he came out of graduation and barely has any field experience. There's too many pauses, casting time, and ridiculous childish spells.. like summoning a pair of demonic hands to grab a street-pole to whack someone! This to me is the worst part. Strange felt incompetent at the start (stumbling through Magic), and then again in No Way Home.. and now in this Madness.

STORY - While a bit chaotic, it's easily followed. Doesn't leave much to the imagination, and doesn't do anything new or mind-bending. If anything, it was probably made without a real plan, and for general audiences to REALLY enjoy. The few nods here and there aren't really enough for fans to go crazy over.. unless they are superficial and easily pleased. It does introduce a new character in America Chavez, but it's still very introspective on the character of Stephen. It slightly deals with a few new topics (some reminiscent of a ""What If"" episode), but the arc doesn't feel earned or advanced in the end. All in all, it feels too humane and grounded.

OTHER - Music usage and forced-horror elements are WAY too crafted and noticeable at times, which takes away from the experience. At no point did I feel tense or scared. It's kind of childish, even! I also felt the movie slowed down for no reason (a certain tunnel scene).

Finally, the VILLAIN. ""They"" work as a scale to compare with Strange's growth, making the lack of new skills even more noticeable. You could even say this appearance overshadows the main cast!

I also didn't particularly like what they did with a specific character. While it was different and unexpected, it felt shallow and directionless. Reminds of what Rian Johnson did to Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I ask myself if they allowed the writers and Raimi to do whatever they wanted. A part of me thinks Marvel finally lost hold of reins of their horse, and it is doing whatever now.

I'm sure people will like it. But I walked out thinking I would have seen this at home, no problem. And may that speak for itself."
The choice is yours,"Directed by Sam Raimi Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has us following up with Stephen Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch). Stephen finds himself on a multiversal journey. When he comes across a young girl named America Chavez(Xochitl Gomez) being pursued by a monster. When he and Wong question her they find out that She has the power to freely travel the Multiverse. And soon other beings begin seeking America. Madness would be the best way to describe this film for both better and worst. The movie within its limits does not hold back from its visuals, action, and Gore It throws a lot at you. The Locations are interesting although there are some realities that when you see them it feels as though you wish you got to see slightly more of those locations. The story does fall apart in many areas there are plot holes where it is clear that doing the multiverse has opened up some recons. In many ways, it feels cluttered in some parts. The tone in many ways feels like a Raimi film when it's said that this is not like the rest of the MCU it's not that far off. There are some things that kids might be able to handle. While you do get the typical Jokes it is not as Forumulalic. Yes, there's a villain and yes the overall goal is to stop the villain. The Action is intense, fast, and Bloody Old PG-13 Style Bloody. The amount of Death that Follows in this Film and How Brutal some of it is Executed. Combine with horror Elements, when it is Raimi putting his vision to the screen. It's here where the film is at its best, when the movie starts to pull away that's where it loses some of its appeal. It might not feel in line with the rest of the MCU you, but it does feel more in line with Doctor Strange. Where sometimes it is bright and colorful, but also has its more grim occult Morbid. The cast themselves Benedict Cumberbatch of course is just as great as always He embodies this character While still having much of that Charm. Although he is downplayed a bit. The whole time people are just judging him saying he's an idiot and he is at fault at the time. And moments where he is just gullible. Wong is Good though he has his problems. Elizabeth Olsen quite possibly has the best performance in the film. Let's just say that they don't puss out with her. The whole plot with American Chavez would seem like if you were going to introduce this character this would probably be the best to put her. While She is not in the way and thrown in the background. Why? Really out of all the characters could introduce you to go with this one. You didn't really need her Stephen and Wanda would have been enough. And Mordo is just there. The Cameos some are cool and others are meh. Overall Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness While does excel again with its style and visuals, the music by Danny Elfman is great. The characters do feel basic and the plot as a whole becomes more cluttered as the film Goes on."
Marvel is dead,I will no longer watch anything marvel. This movie is not what we were sold in trailers and the loki show. Truly a top 5 worst. Whole movie was an exposition dump. Every character was weak and forced. That America Chavez is the worst actor in the marvel franchise. I guess anybody can be in marvel now. She pretty much single handedly ruined every scene she's in. Most of the people who read this won't believe me and actually go see the worst marvel movie ever made. It's DC bad.
Raise your hands if you're tired of this multiverse nonsense,"I keep swearing to myself no more MCU or Spiderman or anything mentioning multiverse. The whole concept is just license to keep opening doors to impossible storylines. Nothing makes sense since reality can be so easily changed with a quick trip to another ""verse"" and alter what you don't like.

I think simple stories worked best with comic book characters. People are interested in the superheroes not what predicaments writers put them in. Watching a Marvel movie now is a job requiring you to take notes and refer back to other movies and quotes. I can't imagine anyone young or old enjoying this type of entertainment.

I will never watch another Marvel movie again! I'm repeating this 100x."
Awful,"That America Chavez character is the worst. Absolutely no acting skills and the character's personality is unbearable. Waste of 2 hours. I loved doctor strange 1, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
Waste of Time,"It's really sad to watch how a skilled horror director wastes his time and skills on a fantasy superhero movie that may be interesting to someone still in the early teens. The most impressing part of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is the title, the story, I guess, would not have had any chance to be published in the early days of pulp fiction. Actors and production are okay, but I dare to say, that like many of Marvel's and DC's movies and shows these days, this one will fall into oblivion quickly."
"Big Ambitions, low results","A Movie that was very confusing, with so many side plots that didn't really need to be in the film. However the crisp look of the film is very good, giving the film a good look. Benedict Cumberbatch performance as Doctor strange was absolutely brilliant. The action scenes were amazing, with brilliant colour and lighting for the film, whilst the action scenes played out, made it a great cinema experience. And I hope we see more of the new characters. The story was interesting with great visual aspects along the way. With brilliant callbacks to the franchise of Marvel as a whole and you'll see what I mean when you see the film for yourself. A lot of good stuff inside of this film, but a lot of bad stuff as well.

Was it Good?

It wasn't terrible, but it was Far from amazing.

Rating stands at: 6.5/10."
Big mess and cringey,"Big mess and the new girl was cringe af, she did no training and with some cringe motivational words from dr strange she suddenly knew everything. I dont care enough to write about everything but that was a really trash movie."
MCU meets Sam Raimi,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is so diffrent from any other MCU project before. You can see Sam Raimi's handwriting all over the film. I like that Marvel dares to show more brutal things in the last projects. Now with Multiverse of Madness and Moon Knight. It was a very refreshing new style of Marvel film, I really enjoyed it."
Bizarre mishmash plot heavy on special effects,
This is not a Dr Strange movie,"I liked the first Dr Strange movie as it was a good take on his origin story and you know, it was about Dr Strange.

This is a bait and switch where Dr Strange is like a cameo character in his own movie, or like a story teller. He has not significant part in this movie and this is all about Wanda.

As such it is okay I guess but they have turned Wanda into such a powerful character that she basically eclipses Thanos. Pointless to have such powerful characters, as there is nothing they cant handle, and so is this whole movie. Pointless and classic bait and switch."
Really Bad,I usually love Marvel but this movie was the absolute worst. They took established characters and ruined them. Every single character in this movie was shallow and poorly written. There was not one character Arc on display for the entire run time. Unbelievable. Not only did they waste the Illuminati but they retroactively made things worse. This is a CGI fest with no brains and no soul.
From a Casual Marvel Viewer's Perspective,
This could have been WandaVision Ep 7,"I love Benedict Cumberbatch. But this was just a long, drawn out episode of WandaVision that never aired. The lovable aspects of Dr Strange's universe, (Wong's banter, the tension between Stephen and Christine, etc) were missing. The plot had a few surprises, but didn't propel the story forward enough to justify a full movie. This could have been a crossover episode of WandaVision and a Strange mini-series, honestly. Not a huge fan of how dark it was. Closer to Morbius than anything.

Do better, Marvel."
how to kill a legendary super hero...,"Caracter, by using a multitude of mad superheroes, and my question are; where do they all come from, and why did they use so many of them...?... when the doctor strange story in itself was such a good consept with small hints of superiority and magic, being smashed and destroyed into a supercabaret of more or less overused A4 sized copies of caracters used in the superhero genre...why???

No, its a big dive back in the iron pot of superherostew, where the superpowers are so generalized and boring, and a strange story has become the same as everything else. For a grumpy old man with slower multitaskingabilities this was just like fighting a war in the fog, where mutiversejumping becomes so trivial that it becomes a muddy mess of boredome.. therefore my doom of plot and story will be harsh and demonizing.

What saves a weak 6 on the overall starsetting has to be the extreme use and technicaladvanced level of cgi use in this production, that kept the grumpy old man away from becoming drowsy and sleepy, yes i am that old. The legendary mr cumberbacht had a hand in there too so if you like the man that noone comes near in roles of strange caracters a recommend, the rest is just a mamrvel production and a big let down to the average ageeing audience of silverscreen enthusiasts..."
The worst marvel movie I've ever seen,"Probably 5 or 10 minutes left till it finished but I walked out. Messy movie, really all over the place with a bunch of random things thrown together for fan service, but as a movie itself it really failed to establish any real pacing. Too many things leading nowhere, very uninspiring plot, no real substance. I can't believe I'm leaving a 1 star review and actually walked out. This is the last thing I expected to be writing here."
Underwhelming & a fully wasted opportunity,"For a movie titled 'Multiverse of madness' there was very little multiverse, and even less madness. I'm not sure why this tremendous opportunity to create something intriguing and exciting was reduced to something that felt like going to Disney land but seeing only a tiny part of a single ride - blindfolded for the rest. I'm guessing perhaps it was cost, but the movie definitely did not fill the brief laid down by that title. Sam Raimi's Spiderman films will always hold a special place but the oversaturated video and occasional feel-fuzzy dialogues seemed like a step down from the usual MCU style. But maybe that's just me. Even ignoring that however, this movie was lazy, unambitious, and extremely lack lustre. Probably the least enjoyable MCU film to date."
Really?,
"Not good, not bad","Both leads are terrific. Special effects have a couple of flaws but otherwise are excellent. Story line is okay, but no real tension or emotional investment. A spectacle of a movie easily forgotten in a few days. Disney has turned Marvel into bubblegum pop movies."
That this movie was made is the real horror!,"If I had to describe this film in one word...it would be garbage.

It is messy, takes incredible Marvel characters and forever destroys them, and totally squanders the vast multiverse of opportunities available.

It seems my hopes for a good capture of the multiverse after Loki were smashed against the rocks. And that is the real horror in this movie.

It seems that DC have finally found the one place they can beat Marvel hands down and that is in their handling of the multiverse and the awesome possibilities it brings.

My only highlight was the extended cameo scene.

At least Eternals is no longer the worst Marvel film!"
Raimi continues the decline,"Raimi pretty doesn't understand comics. Nor does he understand writing these movies.

The rules of this world are questionable.

It's like the CGI quality from Ghost rider as well as the poor writing quality

Sad part is the first Dr Strange is great

Confusing and poorly executed

The Spider-Man trio was a poor start so they gave him this."
Glad i went to see it,"Was foolishly overthought about watching it at cinemas, due to criticism, but the movie was actually a welcomed change to the previous marvel phase setup, it was not boring at any point for the duration of the movie and it was interesting to see how easily things can go really bad that even Thanos Crusade that was the big deal can seem so simple and trivial.

Some comments that i noticed complained about "" not enough multiverse etc etc"" the movie was not called Doctor Strange visits any other universe :) the movie played with multiverse and showed some different ways that interacting with one another can have a number of unpredictable results .

If someone wants a more deep dive into the theme i suggest to watch Loki series, there its explained and shown in a slower pace with more details

Overall a Solid entry for the Genre, and honestly most of the negative comments and chatter can be applied for the most marvel movies out there if taken serious!"
Underwhelmingly enjoyable? Does that make sense?,"I have complex feelings about this movie.

I liked it, I think. But I went in after reading reviews praising it for being ""signature Sam Raimi"", ""very weird"" and ""surprisingly violent."" And some of that is sort of true, I guess.

The Raimi stylization feels more like that ""Say the line, Bart!"" meme. He has a unmistakable little song and dance, and he's playing to the crowd by leaning in to his own gimmicks to the point where it almost feels like a parody of Sam Raimi. I don't know if that's a complaint. Maybe it isn't?

The movie was not weird enough and not violent enough for my expectations. Multiverses are not as weird as Marvel thinks they are. They have spent a long, long time (multiple movies!) easing people in to the concept like nobody's going to understand it. They do a couple of fun things with the idea here, but it feels pretty reserved. I wanted weirder, wackier, more imaginative. For a ""multiverse of madness"" the scope here is pretty small.

As for the violence, the easiest way for me to describe this movie is that it's very clear they are trying to keep a PG-13 rating. There's implied violence, and implied blood, but they always make sure dance around the subject matter so that it's never actually bloody or violent. I don't really care, I'm not one of those gorehounds, but it's just about the expectation, and given what I expected, I got something that was a little softball.

The real problem with this movie is the structure, I guess? It is a movie where a lot of things happen but it almost feels like its being made up as it goes. Good movies build up a concept, like they're chasing an idea that's bigger and wider than just what happens on screen. Like, Jurassic Park is about more than just dinosaurs eating people, and the movie is structured around a metaphor of learning, growth and change, both for the characters in the movie and the audience.

Strange 2... doesn't do that? It is a terribly blunt, straightforward movie. Everything is this bizarre stream of consciousness where there is very little foreshadowing, no setups or payoffs to anything. It hits the ground running with things happening, and when there are no more things left to happen, it ends. It's like the whole movie is one big budget improv routine. It's very bizarre.

And yet I still think I liked it? Strange indeed."
Victim of the hype machine?,"As I was walking home from Sam Raimi's ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" with two friends of mine--one of which is more or less a Marvel fan--we talked about how this one was more of a miss rather than a hit in the MCU's long lore. And while he agreed on the fact that this could've been better, he blamed its flop on the hype.

This is a movie starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange--arguably the super-hero with the most creative abilities in the MCU and also the most philosophical. It's directed by Sam Raimi, the mastermind behind the original Spider-Man trilogy and its theme involves multiverse travel. So, yes, of course it was hyped. But were these expectations not justified, especially considering how ingenious the 2016 prequel was? Personally, I think that while hype can raise expectations in the ridiculous, it wasn't the case with this movie. This is simply an average Marvel film. One which stretched its multi-dimensional plot too thin--even for Marvel standards.

Admittedly, while I knew this movie was going to be less than impressive as I have seen some reviews prior to watching it, I really didn't see any issues until the very ending. The only thing I was thinking up until that point was how I was going to rebuke all these critics for not knowing how to have fun again. But the abrupt breaks Raimi decided to stop his run on were so unexpected I was almost shocked. Whether it was studio interference or simply an emergency writing unraveling, I don't know. The point is ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" decided to cut its own cord in a brutal enough manner to sustain quite a bit of damage as if Marvel Studios' great dark shadow was breathing down Raimi's neck.

It's a shame to see such potential simply breeze through the multiverses--literally; especially considering that this movie had a plot twist early on, really building up on itself. P. S. Though--this is the Marvel movie with the best visual effects yet--and that's saying something."
What a disappointing movie!!!,"Doctor Strange I was one of the best Marvel's movies and my number one superhero. This one is simply a shame!!!!!

Ridiculous plot, an insult to intelligence, flat charecters that do not evolve, ammatueristic acting, what a fall!!!

Boring boring boring... we really counted the time until it finally ended.

Start to seem to me that Marvel simply lost it... like the real Marvell world ended with End game."
Was this a Doctor Strange Movie?,
lacks joy.,"I've been fan of marvel with the iron man. I have watched almost all of the movies at least three times but while watching this one I was wondering, almost all of the time, what the heck am I watching, what is the story, what is going on, what is the meaning of all of these... too many unanswered questions and lacks joy and enthusiasm of the singularity. Multiverse approach is damaging the original idea of the series of avengers and trying to add other heros to the mix is bad idea. This madness must end now."
What a mess,They try to give the feminist the satisfaction and the result was failing all other fans. It should officially named Wanda in the multiverse of feminist. Its so shame to see that happen to my favorite super hero.
A mess!,"Special effects and that's all! I was expecting more from Raimi(being a fan of his Spiderman movies). I am not a Marvel fan! But i really like old Spiderman movies, old Hulk movies! Disney just buried Marvel. They make the movie too childish with the same cringy cheesy formula: jokes..EVEEEEN this movie has a little bit of a darker tone! For me, the guy who plays Dr. Not so Strange is a bad choice! I have never liked this actor! So overrated and boring! Unfortunately, there are so many marvel fanboys who praise everything from Marvel. If Marvel will make a movie about a dog barking for two hours, that movie will still make big money bcz..well..marvel fanboys! There are marvel fans who will REALLY enjoy great stuff! And.. what the heck was that Chavez character? Really? CRINGY and just dumb and again, an LGBTQ character just for the propaganda. (Remember Dumbledore and Grindelwald in that horrible Fantastic Beast) The acting in most of the part of the movie was bellow mediocre! Well, big money at the box office doesn't mean quality! And this movie is far away from being at least mediocre. It is just a mess with so many demons, zombies, gay characters (yaaacs) disappointed new characters and Wanda was bland and boring!"
The marvel horror,"If you wanted a marvel horror flick you've got it. Unfortunately it is really bad. Just too much going on. Tons of fancy cgi and big name actors squandered making a bad movie. Also, they really ruin scarlet witch."
I used to be a Marvel fan,"This is just an awful, pointless mess. After watching this and love and thunder, I'm completely done with the MCU. It's become a hotbed of ridiculousness."
Not sure how the Wanda weirdos will take this but I had fun,"In my review of Black Widow, I talked about how Marvel fans aren't generally that good at dealing with death.

I wrote that death is so rare and/or weightless in the Marvel Universe that the moment someone finally becomes expendable enough to get killed off, fangirls despair. I wrote that the actually meaningful deaths, e.g. That of Black Widow, thus need to be fixed by having the characters appear in prequels, lest the fangirls start a petition to resurrect them (as they did with Quicksilver) because God forbid anything in this canon actually poses a genuine threat to anyone.

Something I failed to mention was the impending Multiverse saga. Now, the possibilities are endless. Anyone we've had to bid farewell to can now very easily be brought back, long as we search within the right timeline, ""parallel universe"", or whatever.

And in no Marvel Studios property were loss and grief so crucial as in last year's WandaVision, where Wanda ""Scarlet Witch"" Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) dabbled in the interdimensional to possibly bring back the person -- or android -- she loves. In the well-made but oft-sloppy Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, she may just get her chance! The movies, after all, are still the ""main"" content.

As much as I enjoyed WandaVision, it does largely exist as a set-up for this new biggie, where the titular Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) begins to explore the Multiverse -- after last year's Spider-Man shenanigans -- and the redoubtable Wanda uses her increasingly evolved witchcraft to ""help"" (or so it seems at first). You'll recall that WandaVision hinted at a connection to a certain other Marvel-branded universe (not just an alternate MCU timeline) and that this particular plot point was just a gag. But after No Way Home introduced that concept for realsies, that's what we're doin'.

I doubt that's a spoiler to anyone after the Super Bowl ad blew up on Twitter back in February and we learned that Patrick Stewart will reprise his role as Charles Xavier (?) from the X-Men film series -- which has such lousy continuity it may as well take place in its own Multiverse. We also see Baron Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) again, as well as Shuma-Gorath, which, as a fan of Marvel vs. Capcom, is one of those character choices that actually got the geek within me kinda stoked. Xochitl Gomez plays newcomer America Chavez, whose superhero shtick is the fact that she's the only America Chavez across the Multiverse; her power is to journey between them.

The movie isn't terrible. The visuals, as guaranteed by the very premise, are much more creative and striking than most MCU films (though some shots recall Thanos' usage of the Reality Gem in Avengers: Infinity War), but it's still about as safe and inoffensive as this kind of story will permit. Its best parts are the ones where Sam Raimi is allowed to go full ""Army of Darkness"" on our asses, taking a break from the Marvel Sludge™. I may even have gotten some feels during its climax.

While it works fine on its own -- despite some glaring continuity issues -- and, on the flip side, its connections to other MCU plots are expected, I am left wondering what the latest mainline Marvel works TRULY have to do with each other.

As of now, the Phase Four storylines don't acknowledge each other all that much -- even when it comes to, say, revelations on how the very cosmos functions (one second Kang is effectively God, the next it's the Celestials). Worse yet, they don't indicate any sort of common goal. Phase Two had similar problems, but even then, the endgame was clear. Here, some works head one way; some head another. Some works, even if they feel like skippable teases, add stuff of great importance, but this stuff only matters to this or that series.

I'm starting to wonder if Kevin Feige still has a plan. Back in the day, even if the world-building was occasionally questionable, the MCU mostly held together and was clearly building toward the Infinity Saga. Even when the post-credit teasers were for solo adventures like Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming, almost all movies seemed to look toward the same ultimate battle. Now, all kinds of universe-breaking things are being built up/teased, all of them going in different directions.

Shang-Chi teased something huge with the Ten Rings that hasn't been elaborated upon (despite Benedict Wong, who made the urgent discovery, having appeared in two flicks since). Eternals introduced all kinds of crazy sh-t, but only really teased the Blade reboot without any sign we'll see the Eternals, say, have dinner with the Avengers (or that anyone gives a f-ck about the giant Celestial that almost burst through the planet à la Bionicle 4). All the Black Widow-Hawkeye stuff is kind of going its own way too. And while Loki indicated that the next MCU ""boss"" will be Kang the Conqueror, I now honestly doubt we'll see that many Avengers come together to fight him. He's in an Ant-Man movie next, for crying out loud!

All that being said, I think Doctor Strange 2 works just fine as its own movie (taking better advantage of these concepts than the first Strange) and that it hints at interesting things to come. But really, the most rewarding part has been people's reactions to Wanda's lamentation (as seen in the Super Bowl ad) that she gets labeled a villain just because she broke the rules once:

Some of us would point out that what she did to ""break the rules"", more precisely, was to mind-control an entire village into acting out her small-town fantasies. Others would reveal more than enough about themselves by either playing Wanda's Advocate (though their defenses would usually reduce themselves to ""Well, yes, BUT..."") or explicitly declare that Wanda could commit genocide and they would still ""stan"" this fictional comic-book lady -- which is a very normal and well-adjusted thing to base your personality/Twitter persona around. Take this with you the next time you worry Zoomers use the Internet too much; it's literally better for public safety that some people are terminally online."
Worst Movie,
This is The Scarlet Witch,
What the hell was that??,"I'm sorry but is there anyone who liked this movie. I love SF, and even that pinch of horor is good but there is absolutley no plot. Boring conversations, too many unnecessary side characters and fight scenes. I felt like I was watching some low budget movie.

SPOILER ALERT: Can anyone explain to me how Strange and Wong know about Spiderman when Strange deleted everyone's memories about Spiderman, including himself and Wong?"
Middling,"Marvel movies seem to have lost their pizazz after being subjugated by Disney. Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Mediocrity is perfectly fine if you are a child, not concerned with a discernible plot or intelligent storytelling, and easily satisfied by vacuous CGI action sequences. America Chavez is the most boring character to ever exist in a superhero movie. You would think that after 73 jumps to various multiverses she would have bothered to explore the extent of her powers or even tried to locate her mothers. Of course, the movie would have only lasted less than 30 minutes if she was not the hapless damsel in distress."
weak villain to strengthen diversity,
Not really a dr strange movie,Dr strange is side charcter in his own movie. Script is junk. Basically jump the shark moment. The action is good. The rest is mess. Wanda is nutty and unlikeable and America Chavez is a distraction. Dr strange is an after thought. No one will see a strange movie going forward. Good job marvel.
Should have been JUST a movie,"This movie is trying to be way too many things. A Doctor Strange movie, a Wanda movie, a promotion for Disney+, for other MCU characters, trying too hard to be too as inclusive as possible... it feels compromised, diverted from what it should have been : a more assumed movie, a more adult movie. A Sam Raimi movie."
"you had me at ""Scarlet Witch""","This entry gets points not so much for getting things right, but more for NOT getting things wrong. Olsen's astonishing recent TV series was an example of Marvel at its best. The recent over-written and over-bearing Spiderman entry was Marvel at its worst. Here, finally, Dr. Strange, freed from his own tedious backstory, gets to establish a character. And, as for Olsen, as the saying goes, I could happily watch her sort bait."
"A bit horror, a bit strange and not enough multiverse",
"""This time, it's going to take more than killing me to kill me.""",
How well do you know your MCU?,"Doctor Strange protects America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), a teenager with the ability to travel through the multiverse, who is being hunted by The Scarlet Witch.

A Masters degree in Marvelology is required to fully understand Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Modules that need to have been successfully completed include the entire Avengers series, the Spiderman movies, the previous Doctor Strange film, and all episodes of WandaVision, with some knowledge of most other Marvel movies being advantageous. I clearly haven't been putting in the hours, 'cos a lot of this movie went way over my head.

Still, it sure looks great, with plenty of impressive, surreal special effects sequences, Evil Dead director Sam Raimi delivering mind-bending alternate realities and more than a smidge of the macabre (Sam's love of horror is evident throughout); I just wish I knew what was happening more of the time. Talk of the Darkhold, the Vishanti, and the Illuminati, plus a battle using musical notes, all left me scratching my head in confusion. I think I must be getting a little too long in the tooth for modern superhero films: I left this one with a headache and no particular desire to see the next movie.

5/10. The best part is when Doctor Strange and America crash through several parallel universes, including one where everything is made of paint -- it's totally bonkers. Shame the rest of the film wasn't as satisfying as those fleeting glimpses of alternate worlds."
Phase 4 isn't really doing it for me,
A forgettable viewing experience. Watch only as mindless popcorn entertainment,"While I commend Sam Raimi for his distinct directorial style and trying to make a visually appealing film (which yes it is at times, when it's not a CGI cluster mess), this movie is one of the numerous examples that Marvel film quality has been deteriorating rapidly. Nothing more than popcorn entertainment with a basic, shallow plot. Performances are nothing to rant over, both Elizabeth Olsen and Benedict Cumberbatch play their respective roles fine as expected. The storyline is forgettable and Multiverse of Madness is essentially one of the many throw-away superhero films in recent years from the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
Better than most say,"I liked this movie a lot more than other people I guess, the style of the movie from Sam Raimi was super entertaining and I absolutely loved it and it made it unique; but I can see how people were a little disappointed as it really didn't have that many cameos or a world-ending event movie feel. The movie definitely could've been longer but I think the individual conflicts of the characters were pretty good, although America Chavez should've gotten her Disney+ show released before this movie because she felt a little out of place and sudden in the movie. The action had great balance with grounded fights, monster fights, extremely weird and funny fights, and lots of sorcery and witchcraft. The cameos in this movie didn't feel as well earned as No Way Home's Spider-men but some of them were pretty funny and enjoyable. Overall it is very much a Sam Raimi movie that is bogged down by some of the MCU constraints, but is nonetheless a very enjoyable movie."
Sam Raimi X MCU,"I'm not gonna say much, just if you like the MCU and you like Raimi, you're in for a double whammy! It's as simple as that nuff said!

But of course this means the review is too short. So what I can add is that if you don't like the MCU or Raimi, this probably won't touch you and think this movie is just weird."
Continues the titular hero's story with stunning visuals and solid emotional payoffs,"""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" is the sequel to 2016's ""Doctor Strange"" and the 28th film to be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role and directed by Sam Raimi (The ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, Sony Pictures's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy, ""Drag Me To Hell""), it continues the titular hero's story with stunning visuals and solid emotional payoffs.

A short time after the events of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) saves New York City from an invisible octopus creature while rescuing a mysterious young girl amidst the chaos. The girl later introduces herself as America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), revealing to him that she has the ability to travel across the multiverse, which in turn has attracted many dangerous creatures after her powers. After hearing her explanation, Strange learns that his alternate self from America's universe was under mind control via witchcraft and decides to meet up with Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) to see if she knows anything about these current events.

Since his big screen debut back in 2016, Doctor Strange has established himself as one of the most important heroes in the entire MCU. From making a giant inter-dimensional entity rage quit his evil plans to holding his own against the mad Titan Thanos in a battle for the Infinity Stones, Strange is not only a valuable asset to the Avengers, but also an incredibly powerful hero in his own right. Six years after his first film, Strange finally has another solo role outside of appearing in other hero's films with ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" showing us the dire consequences of tampering with unknown forces.

In contrast to previous films and TV series showing the fun aspects of accessing the multiverse, this one treats the very idea of its unfamiliarity as a deadly serious issue. Strange, who experienced first hand what happens when things go horribly wrong back in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", is presented in an incredibly vulnerable state. Gone is the cocky sorcerer supreme he started out as and what we have in his place is someone who hasn't yet realised the severity of toying with something so frightening. This adds some much needed depth to Strange as a character, similar to how it took the loss of half the universe's population for Tony Stark to realise importance of having a true family. Stark and Strange have always been kindred spirits with arrogant personalities who need a reality check in order to humble themselves, and this film shows how the latter is now coming to terms with this sudden urge to keep his ego in check.

Returning to the director's chair after nine years, Sam Raimi injects his signature style into every scene while also delivering a Marvel film like no other so far. Of course, Raimi is no stranger to the superhero genre since many are familiar with his work on the Sony ""Spider-Man"" films but he is also known for writing and directing horror films like the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and ""Drag Me to Hell"". It seems like some of Raimi's personal affinity for the genre has rubbed off into this one since he can't help but push the boundaries of what the audience could consider nightmare fuel. I loved how he made the hostile inhabitants of various multiverses seem so terrifying, even relying on the odd jump scare to keep viewers on their toes. Another thing Raimi is known for is his off-the-wall comic relief intended to calm the audiences' nerves after viewing something scary. There were plenty of moments that should provide the occasional chuckle to relieve the tension in a scene, some of which may even surprise veteran MCU fans. I can't discuss too much else about Raimi's best directorial moments since they will venture into major spoiler territory so all I will say is that if you are familiar with his films, keep a close eye out for some of those hidden Easter eggs.

Visually, this is the most vibrant looking Marvel film to date. Raimi goes all out to emphasise how much better or worse these multiverses look in comparison to our own. Certain places may give off the appearance of somewhere futuristic and high tech while others look like a post-apocalyptic wasteland. No matter which of the two, I really enjoyed how different they each seemed whenever Strange happened to stumble into one or the other. Despite all of these intertwining universes, the film is still pretty easy to follow. In most other media that deal with inter-dimensional travel and exploration, you expect things to be confusing due to the multitude of things happening all at once. However, for the most part, the film has adopted a more straightforward method of telling the story. I'm not sure if this was Raimi's decision or if Kevin Feige and the other higher ups at Disney wanted things this way, but I think this was the right thing to do overall.

Something else that took me by surprise was the quality of the film's score. In recent decades, there haven't been that many memorable musical motifs in superhero films. Aside from perhaps some of the Batman movies, the MCU happens to be the worst offender in this category. ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" appears to remedy this by recruiting Danny Elfman to bring us what could be considered the best musical score in a Marvel film since the four ""Avengers"" movies. Not only does Elfman implement some of the original ""Doctor Strange"" theme into his score but also certain tunes from other media I won't mention here at the risk of giving away spoilers. Elfman is a frequent collaborator with Sam Raimi so their combined efforts helped elevate this film above what could have been another one with a forgettable score. In addition to keeping an eye out for visual Easter eggs, I also think fans should keep an ear out as well.

As mentioned earlier, the Doctor Strange we have been familiar with over the past six years is noticeably different in this film and Benedict Cumberbatch plays into that perfectly. I liked seeing this more pragmatic Strange making decisions based on what is necessary rather than out of recklessness, especially after we are shown the dangerous ramifications of upsetting the balance of the multiverse. Likewise, it's also nice to see Elizabeth Olsen finally having the opportunity to play Wanda Maximoff closer to her Scarlet Witch persona. I'd been wondering when we'd actually see this particular incarnation on the big screen and it sure was satisfying to see her done justice. Also, newcomer Xochitl Gomez does a fine job holding her own alongside the rest of the cast. It's always entertaining to see young characters who wield incredible powers finding out how to keep them under control and it's equally as interesting to see how she learns how to use them in combat.

I feel I should now address the elephant in the room, in that there has been speculation over the implementation of some newly acquired IPs thanks to Disney's buyout of certain companies. Before its release, there were many rumours circulating that this film contains some exciting alleged cameos. Without spoiling any of these possible appearances, all I will say is keep your expectations to a reasonable level because not all of them turned out to be true. This film is by no means on the same plain as ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" in terms of fanservice but it does have a few great surprises that seem to show the direction the MCU is heading.

In its current state, the MCU looks set to deliver some new and exciting content in the near future. From what I can gather, Phase 4 has undoubtedly been its most experimental so far. We've seen Disney+ series expand upon some already established hero backstories and some movies that have even deviated from the typical origin story template as a whole. ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" is yet another crucial puzzle piece in a bigger picture that has long been laid out for us. Regardless of how it all turns out in the end, the MCU isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

I rate it 8/10."
Unique and captivating,"That was the most non-MCU-like MCU film so far. And I say that as a good thing, this expansion of aesthetic choices and styles from directors is the future of the MCU. Aside from the awesome visuals/styles/jump scares/costumes and amazing score, Elizabeth Olsen delivers a master class in acting, cameos are not overdone, Strange has his best character portrayal yet and new stars (pun totally intended) shine bright. I can see how the plot might be less than it is if you are not as well versed in the other marvel projects such as WandaVision... End Game... Loki (and more) but I think it's an exiting story regardless of being a nerd or not and I shamelessly loved every moment."
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,
"Visually stimulating, but cerebrally dead.","There are so many problems with this script that I think it was written by people who just didn't care to make anything good or logical.

The script is sloppy, illogical and weak. I found far too many problems with the story, the theme, the characters, the continuity, inconsistency with the use of powers, the use conflict between characters, the characters from different dimensions, portal usage, and the conflict of using deus ex machina on several occasions.

The worst part of the movie was that it was completely predictable. When I realized what Scarlet Witch was trying to do, I realized the ending. That is terrible writing. You have to keep this stuff hidden from the viewer.

This was a corporate, status quo, cookie cutter movie.

Now for the good part. The CG is awesome. Visually it was stimulating. I thought the graphics were awesome and watching it on a high end 65 inch television was the best. Visually I thought it was incredible.

I also thought the cameo from Bruce was fun, but what did you expect with Sam Raimi directing? As usual, you will need to watch the ending and credits for a few extra scenes."
Wanda Vision 2.0,"Didn't seem like a Doctor Strange movie, more of a weird Wanda Vision spin off. Overall a bad plot with decent cgi action to keep it somewhat watchable."
Marvel's brave new world,"We all see and know the new direction marvel is going in, and many of us really don't like it.

Felt like a movie meant to set up future movies that no one really wants to see. Felt like Dr. Strange was really only there to be a foil for the characters around him."
Avarage,"It was ok but didn't really excite me,it had lots of special effects but the story wasn't the greatest,a few cameos but not that many as I thought there would be, it could have been so much better but the last great mcu movie was endgame."
Not what I've come to expect from MCU,"The film was pretty boring overall considering they had a multiverse to explore. The new character was unlikeable, the story line lacked substance or much explanation. Sam Raami made his style B rate horror using marvel characters. It was like an extended episode of what if? Very cartoony in content. Very disappointed as the first doctor Starnes was excellent. They also threw in a bunch of cameos to try and make it interesting... it didn't."
Way less than the sum of its parts,"From the very first scene, this felt more like a Disney Plus special or a video game than an actual movie. They attempted to bring together so many varied threads - WandaVision and What If... and subplots from the original Dr Strange that happened 6 years ago, not to mention references to other MCU properties. Following everything practically requires a glossary. In order to make that work, it feels like half this movie is exposition and the other half is forced action/dialogue with pretty low stakes. Tons of people die, but I rarely cared about them. Tons of things happen, but I rarely cared about that either. They threw so many things together, but it never quite added up."
Spectacle CGI Show,"I don't like MCU. However, the first Dr. Strange movie was the best MCU movie because it had a structure, plot, character development. This one has none of those.

The movie is not about Doctor Strange to begin with. It should have been named Scarlet Witch: Never Without My Kids(How I Burnt the World). The story is ridiculous. I forced myself to watch the first half just for the sake of first movie. The second half was a horror show with great VFX and CGI...

It's not PG-13 btw. It is R rated. Especially the second half of the movie is horror genre. To conclude, do not believe fanboys 10, 9, 8 ratings... It is forgettable."
After 30 minutes I realised the negative comments are nonsense,Seriously getting sick of people leaving negative reviews about really good movies. Let's start with this. ITS NOT REAL. Why cant people just take movies for what they are. A made up movie. It's not a true life story a documentary. It's from a comic book. It's very entertaining and a very good movie. End of. Whoever watched this obviously didn't watch it at all. Cause to say strange isn't in this movie is a joke.
When marvel goes too far...,"Is it me or is this the most baffling marvel film there is? Is there a plot or a story? It just seemed to be nonsense. A film should make sense whether you are a big fan or a novice. I like Marvel but I'm a casual viewer. I don't want to watch a film where it's like, ""you need to watch film 23 and episode 9 of season 1 to understand the plot. Loved the first film too. This is literally madness."
Messy,"Superhero movies don't normally have logic, complex story or deep character development. But even considering those standards this movie fell short.

A lot of older marvel movies had way more logic, character development than this. This had more fancy CGI and longer fight sequences. The whole package seemed off and not enjoyable to watch."
Is Disney destroying all franchises in purpose?,"Generations of meticulously crafted storytelling down the drain through bad taste, mediocre production and neurotic script.

Does Disney do it in purpose?

Will leaving a 1 star review change their plan to destroy culture?"
Why doesn't Wanda find a universe where her boys lost their mother?,
I wanted to walk out,"Terrible movie, marvel is trying way too hard to incorporate different characters. It was confusing and some scenes didn't even make sense. Wanda's acting was poor and overall was a weak storyline. Would not recommend."
Dr. Strange 2? No. WandaVision extended season finale? Yes.,"If you were looking for a Dr. Strange heavy movie with lots of character development, you'd be disappointed. This feels more like an extended season finale for WandaVision brought to the big screen. The focus was one big fight between Wanda & Dr. Strange, with some new minor characters brought in but with no real context or development throughout the film. As expected from the trailer & director, this is one of Marvel's darkest films. It's not super demonic, but it will give young kids a scare, & was dark enough that I would never watch this again for solo entertainment. Also plan to go in on a full stomach or with water in hand. There are so many visuals that it sometimes felt like I was watching through a kaleidoscope, way more constant than the first Dr. Strange, & I got nauseous & dizzy throughout the movie. Basically, this movie is better for nothing more than to see WandaVision's story come to an end, & that's pretty much it."
Book of Madness,"Sam Raimi is back - usually it is not a nice thing to say. Where was he? Was he away? What did he do and so forth ... all things that one has to answer. Maybe he was in a differeren universe (one of the other Multiverses you know?) or somewhere else. But it is just a simple welcome back to the big screens. And I am certain he will be succesful with this outing. Actually the money generated already makes this one of the biggest hits (potentially) of this year.

But enough of financial and personal gain (of the director). This is a continuation of the Dr. Strange story - but also a continuation of the story of Wanda Maximoff. The nowadays better know Olson sister of them all. If you have seen Wandavision - which does not seem to be too necessary. It is a nice to know - like there may be also something that might give you some What if callback (Season 1 that is, the only one available right now). On the other hand Sam Raimi also has his usual recurring actor - in a neat small and funny role.

So combine the stories (and no Spiderman, though Avengers in general get name checked) and add the Sam Raimi flavor to it. Because there is horror - so much so, that it seems like some viewers felt the need to express this here on imdb by claiming that the violence level is high. Well for a Marvel (MCU) superhero movie you can say that. Do not expect this to be super brutal though.

Not much about the story was shared and I avoided most spoilers. Thankfully I did not watch the trailers - there are quite a few moments that are taken away from the first time on the big screen experience. Which was on an Imax screen for me - and in 3D. The effects were quite nice - though having the Avatar 2 trailer playing right before it ... well let's just say that looks monumental. Hopefully that will not take anything away from what some will experience.

Back to this for one last time: action starts off from the start, you won't have much time to think about what is happening (which is a good thing, because there are quite a few holes to be found here), there is not enough time to explore all the Multiverses and even with 2 plus hour run time, this does not feel like it is too long - rather the opposite.

As usual stay for the scenes during and after the credits. One mid and one after. Both are well worth the wait - revelation wise and the other one because it is just super funny. New characters get introduced here and the Dr. Strange universe gets expanded. I wouldn't mind seeing more of Wong ... very funny and playfully acted by .. Wong. Tempted to watch it a second time in cinemas to be honest ... you may feel the same."
Horrible,"The ""America Chavez "" character is such a horrible actress!!!

Felt like a b-rated film every time she was on scene.

Graphics were mediocre

Benedict did a good job as always... Liked that Marvel made this film darker."
Sam Raimi Madverse.,
"Astonishing & Terrifying Madness, But Not For Every Taste!","""Multiverse of Madness"" is the perfect blend between what we know from the MCU lore and Raimi's horror elements that I didn't know that I needed, but now I can't stop thinking about it! Starts off with the familiar MCU tone and switch to more horror and weird in the back half. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it!

There's a lot of multiverse fun, but this is not cameo parade...saying that, there's a lot surprises. I mean a lot!

Liz Olsen is the real MVP for me, her scenes are brutal...you'll see. Benedict Cumberbatch proves that he's born for this role and this time you can tell how much fun he got playing all these versions of himself.

Wong is pure joy as always, such a great character, pure gem for the MCU.

America Chavez is the newest MCU member, but man...she instantly becomes favorite with her charisma.

Danny Elfman's music is insane, switching between Wanda's and Strange's themes so often is scary, but also so fulfilling.

The magic stuff, the battles, most of the visual effects, the MCU once again proves why this is the best universe...or should I say multiverse?

There're is so much emotional impact, but also of course universe consequences.

Stay out of the internet, before you see the movie! You don't want someone to spoil this astonishing new piece of the MCU!

It is the goriest MCU film it won't be for everyone, especially for kids, but all adult MCU fans will love it! There are a few clunky dialogues, but it wasn't big deal for me.

About the end and the credit scenes..."
Marvel is dead,"The post credit scene sum's it up. It was just not worth it. It was so bad that it made Morbius look like a decent movie. Hell this movie makes the ridiculous Fantastic four movie look good. This is just not Marvel material. Some scenes were absurd, pathetic and mostly no fun at all. The most important thing is that for the first time I went out of the cinema after watching a Marvel movie with no enthusiasm at all. Even the music was depressing. The whole thing just didn't work for me."
Marvel restricting Raimi,
Mostly an agonizing slog,
Not as expected,"The acting of each player is really good. However, the script is bad. That's annoying and annoying.

This film gives the audience's expectations too high and then drops them. It's a bad movie."
Totally boring and...,Totally boring and nonsensical from the first second!! Who wrote this? I watched 30 minutes of it and could not keep my eyes open. Maybe good for 5-year-olds who enjoy monster octopuses with one giant eye. (Was that supposed to be a joke??) Don't bother with it!
Ruined Wanda,
SO BAD,
Missleading titel,
Horror? Pardon me?,"I don't care if this movie has ""jump scares"" or ""more darkness than the average Marvel movie"". This is a superhero film. Marvel exclusively makes superhero films. Marvel is trying to reach their hands into as many categories as possible, and it seems it's gotten to, out of all things, the horror genre. In times like this when the box office is controlled by one genre, the horror community has to stay strong to even survive. We must prove that exciting movies do exist outside the realm of superheroes."
Simply bloody stupid!,"People who watched this movie will get completely madness!

Come Marvel, you guys can't hire a better person to write a decent script?

I don't want to give away any spoilers because there's nothing to give, a total waste of time and money!

Dumb actings too, Mr. Cucumber is a complete idiot, only Wong gave his best!

Just don't bother seeing it, the first one was much better! By the way, can you guys give Mr. Cucumber a better toupee? I know he's getting bald, but these wigs looked really fake and made him more stupid!"
Epic Letdown,"I enjoyed the first Doctor Strange movie, it was one of my favorite Marvel movies yet but this one was an epic letdown. Such a letdown that I have absolutely no interest in seeing the next one. It's as if they tried to make a kid friendly horror movie with a bunch of Nonsense hidden lightly in the background.. This movie was completely unnecessary and only pushes me farther away from the marvel universe."
Spectacular visuals and lots of fan-satisfying surprises! :-),"Lots of Easter Eggs for anyone who has seen all the MCU movies and Disney+ shows! :-) And while I favor the more grounded side of the MCU without multiverse antics, I found this thrilling and very enjoyable! :-)"
My experience was ruined by the trailers,"So... This is a good film. A great film. It has a crazy amount of action and the action is incredible. The CGI is kicked up to such heights that it sometimes surpasses Endgame. If you go expecting Dr. Strange and his cool powers, you get Dr. Strange and his cool powers.

If you... suddenly expect certain characters to show up because of the trailers then you'll be disappointed. I'd say the trailers revealed 90% of the surprises. At least to me.

That's not to say the film's surprises aren't spectacular. There's one particular character that shows up that made my jaw drop because of what I've seen in the what if series if you've watched that.

The thing is the villain in this movie was incredible. I've never seen a marvel movie make a villain this scary before. Even green goblin doesn't match. But the whole time I was expecting some new crazy twist that would make me get up from the chair and cheer and it didn't happen. I was expecting something I hadn't seen from the trailers and it distracted me from appreciating the movie's finer details and gifts.

There were some emotional moments that failed to affect me because I was too busy waiting for the whole universe to be ripped open and a thousand alternate universe avengers to descend and save the day and give me the bliss and joy I had been expecting. It didn't happen.

This is a Dr. Strange movie and that's that. But looking back I realised it was a top tier movie by itself. There were some genuinely tense moments followed by real consequences, and real impact. It gave me that old school comic book vibe of anything can happen. I was thrilled.

The action was so colorful so beautiful. Ever shot could have been a wallpaper. There are so many strange crazy things that happen in this film that make you feel like you're on a roller coaster but like I said if you're expecting this movie to be basically an avengers movie you won't get that.

The film was a 7/10 because of my disappointment. If I hadn't watched the trailers it would have been a 9/10.

Also Wanda is in this. A lot. So might wanna watch wandavision before this."
"This is your best, really?!","This is worst Marvel movie ever seen! It is boring and simply stupid. Best thing the came with me this time is a witch, who tries to get teleported to another universe to steal her parallel self's children. Really? You think it is interesting? Or those characters can deserve any sympathy or interest? I rather would watch fireplace, or ants building their colony, or piece of crap floating in the water. I am sure in one thing however - this is last marvel movie I ever seen."
"Moments of potential, ruined by moments of cringe","DrStrange 2 was very disappointing. Instead of being a movie solely about him, they decide to shoehorn a female protagonist and an ""anti-hero"" character solely for an agenda. The 1st dr strange movie was miles ahead of this movie. It was actually about drstrange and his struggles, not a spiritual sequel to a trash streaming show. I found myself looking forward to theovie being over. Oh well! The mcu will live on no matter."
Marvel is dead!,"Watched about 45 minutes then decided washing my dishes was a better way to spend my time.

Marvel truly is dead! Everything after End Game is just milking the dead cow , that's started to decompose."
Disjointed and Disappointing,
The Thanos snap was real! This is another universe! This is not the marvel I grew up with!,"After Endgame, it feels like we're living in a different universe. Superheroes suddenly all have emotional and mental issues. More and more male superheroes die or get replaced by females or something else .... in about 10 years, they will all be gay, or bi, or non...whatever name they have for these abominations. These abominations will be the superheroes of future generations. It's a very sad thing to see...where everything is going."
The worst Marvel movie and that's really saying alot,This film was a bloody joke. Scorcese said all I need to about these movies. Some of them are watchable but this was a disaster from the acting to the CGI to the stupid plot. I'll give it one star becuase it make me laugh unintentionally a few times!
I love Sam Rami but man was this film dissapointing,"Starting off with the positives here, the special effects in this film are second to none. Some of the scenes in the film were genuinely amazing, especially those involving the scarlet which going on a rampage (don't worry I won't go into detail in this review). But aside from the visuals and some genuinely great scenes the movie fall extremely short of expectations. The plot in the film is extremely weak, and the introduction of America Chavez was really underwhelming, she isn't a compelling character in the slightest, nothing against the actress, but the character herself just isn't good. All in all, the effects and a few stand-out scenes aside the film was underwhelming with plot and the character of America Chavez being the main issues."
There's two totally different movies here,"The problem with this movie is that it's two totally different movies, and two totally different styles very badly mashed together.

The marvel style just doesn't fit that dark horror style.

The scenes with scarlet witch were simply excellent. The rest... decidedly average.

It just felt very by the numbers and sooo formulaic.

Which is sad because with some editing and a little rewrite this could have been a fabulous movie. You can definitely tell that there were extensive reshoots."
What did I just watch?,"Strip away the CGI and this would be people on green screen sets, nothing more. The actors show it by how they are acting. They show no real investment in the story, what little there is. This is supposed to be horror but it's the ""teenagers go into a cabin in the woods"" variety. Nothing like Hitchcock or other masters of real horror.

Blech. The worst of Marvels offerings to date."
It's alright,It's alright. It's more of a horror/scary film than anything. I don't see it fitting in with the storyline or anything in the MCU. It moves and too fast pace compared to other face paced films. It gets confusing at points and yea.
"One-time watch, regular Marvel movie.","Out-and-out Elizabeth Olsen show, hella acting! Other than that, it's just your regular (but good) marvel movie.

Great CGI, some comedy here and there, ""new"" characters, etc., while setting things up to make you watch more Marvel content.

Some of the parts were Bollywood-esque, too much melodrama for my taste but nothing wrong with that I suppose.

I really want to learn long-term business planning from Kevin Feige."
Probably worst Marvel movie..!,"Great graphics no doubt. But where is the story??

The name should be only ""Madness"", because it has that effect on audience.

First time in all the marvel movies I have seen before, I thought to leave the theatre at least 20 times.

I held on only because I was fan of Dr Strange character, but it kept disappointing me until the end.

Really sorry with everything about the movie, the dialogues, the acting, the storyline.!!!

Please do not watch it in theatre, same some money.!!!"
"Loved parts, hated parts, it's so mixed",
I'm not mad...just disappointed,"The dialogue is poor, the character's powers are all completely circumstantial in order to benefit the lack of creativity in the writing and the title is misleading. On top of this, the writers have tried to cover all of this up by shoving cameos down our throats in order to appeal to the masses. The movie does get more enjoyable as it progresses but all in all I felt a little...meh..."
Dr Strange and the Multiverse of boredom....,"Long and boring, like staring into a kaliedoscope for 2 hours...

I actually nodded off at one point, which just goes to show, non-stop CGI and zero plot does not a movie make.

It would probably be a great watch if you were tripping, but it sure wasn't engauging on any level.

Even Cumberbatch was reduced to just doing continual 'straining' facial expressions like he had really really bad constipation.

I guess its just for kids and adults with a similar mental age...

Luckily for us, our local cinema is very cheap!"
Not as good as the first movie,I thought Dr Strange Multiverse was pretty good but I preferred the first one. The first one had a better storyline and some humour which is lacking in this one. Basically if you haven't seen the last Spider-Man movie (which I haven't)some things won't mean much to you and it got a bit repetitive (in my view). It makes references to Wandavision (which I also haven't seen). I'd give it 6.5/10. Lots of CGI which gets a bit monotonous and seems added to compensate for not such a good plot. Miss Tilda Swinton who made the first movie special.
Good movie!,
Bombed,"Actually i changed my mind and review after realizing and analyzing movie scenes . I agree with this guys, movie su**ed. Was good to watch some scenes , according to those scenes it has this rsting, otherwise as a movie this is 5/10.

Respect Benedict but it was a garbage comparong to first one. Thank you."
Good Wanda Maximoff / Scarlett Witch film - wrong title,"This is a Wanda film, not a Dr Strange film.

It shows much more of her story, character development, and powers than it does of Stephen Strange's.

I liked it but the CGI is patchy and even for a Marvel film, the characters abilities are incredibly inconsistent.

Not one of the best Marvel has to offer but enjoyable none-the-less."
The main problem are the real antagonist !,
Dr Medium,"Marvel is going downhill super fast and this newest Marvel film just proves it.

Cool visuals, but a boring and meh storyline.

Mutliverse more like 1-2 universes and scarlet witch is such a bad villian. Illumenati fights was so funny, was ment to be serious but i laughed out loud.

They should never have hired sam rami.

Not gonna watch the next marvel film, cause this is getting just sad, sadly this film does not deliver."
Totally Madness !!!,From the 1st scene the movie picks up the pace and till the end it holds the powerful story and brilliant cast performances. We all know when we talk about Dr Strange one thing that came in our mind was VISUALS. And this movie lives up to its expectations and gives us visual delight. Hatts of to the Director SAM RAIMI who directs the multiverse so well even if the expectations from this movie was sky high but still the movie gives you whatever you are looking for. Performance of all the actors was just mind blowing from lead to support everyone has given justice to their role. And Yes there's a few surprises in the movie that will make your day so be far from spoilers. If you are Marvel movie fan then this movie won't disappoint you at any cost just give it a try..
The Wonder Woman 1984 of the MCU,
Worst Marvel movie I've ever seen,"This is some Mortal Kombat 1995 level campiness. The dialogue will make you want to gouge your eyes out. The cinematography is a total mish-mash of CGI in 1000 different angles. The story is rehashed Wandavision, with zero new consequential plot points aside from terrible CGI ""multiverse"" that is straight from a 50s Doctor Who.

Worst Marvel movie I've ever seen. I want my 2 hours back."
Marvel chose Quantity over Quality,"To many visible flaws in direction. I don't think Marvel is taking their work seriously. It's like now days they are more into quantity instead of quality.

Poor side characters acting and even main characters seems exhausted in some scenes and the scenes didn't come out well."
Boring,"Just like the whole Marvel phase 4 : bland, boring and uninspired.

I struggled to finish this one. Not even the bad fan service could save me from the multiverse of boredom."
Not getting the bike you wanted for Christmas,"What was alluded to be one of the biggest marvel movies of all time, a cross over point for new franchises in the mcu was nothing more than a super corny and awkwardly acted dissapointment."
Don't understand,"Can somebody explain what the story is just so boring and pointless, clutching at straws making these stupid films just wasted 2 hours of my precious time."
70 minutes was quite enough,"The running time of Doctor Strange was 2 hpurs 6 minutes but I had had enough after 70 minutes and left,

A messy and film which was overlong and just plain silly! The storyline was also confusing

On the positive side the film had great special effects and Dominic Cumberbatch was great. The costumes and sets were also good as was some of the script. The music was also good. Also good to see Patrick Stewart, Charlize Theron and a few other well known faces

However, our overall verdict is a messy film which I would not pay and go to see having gone to a private viewing. Could have been far far better

It was rather disappointing and I have been left wondering why on earth the Daily Mail gave it 5 Stars! Not half as good as the original Dr Strange film."
DISAPPOINTMENT,"I expected too much from this movie but it was a disappointment for me, the story was flat and super predictable, casts did well, the vfx was on point, there are so many cameos in the movie but there is no point in introducing cameos when they have no impact on the movie, not a single memorable cameo, the action scenes was good especially the 1st and 2nd one, and some of the action scenes are too rushed. The climax was super predictable, climax was the biggest let down for me. Mcu's next phase is kinda meh.

Positives: Performances by the casts, vfx.

Negatives: predictable story, other than 3 characters all the others are not written well."
Painful to watch.,"Doctor Strange And The Multiverse Of Madness.

I guess Marvel is tired of DC hogging all the bad reviews.

So let's call a spade and spade and say Raimi practically directed a rehash of Evil Dead 1,2 and 3 and done it horrendously, with a massive budget."
Eye candy,"The film was so bad it's bad, not enjoyable at all. Watched the film with a group of friends even two who liked the doctor strange films and the person who liked it the most said it was just okay, the rest of us agreed that it's a poor film and a waste of time."
Wasted a good director's talents,"Contrary to the popular opinion, this is just a mindless cash grab where a director is restricted by a cinematic universe to churn out a sub-par action comedy flick."
Alright Sequel,
Fail,The CGI of this movie is awful like black widow. This is not like schang-chi or eternals. The girl is cringed and I think the marvel era is over. You can't make a good movie by getting different characters every time.
More madness less of a storyline.,"I love marvels and i was excited from this film but... but... i was dissappointed when they made Wanda the villain from a story left from Wanda Vision. I deeply felt her pain and madness in Wanda Vision compared with this movie. We all know Wanda has a kind heart despite being broken.

Marvel teas that this multiverse will surprise us with more characters... nahh. I expected more universe from ""multi""verse but gave us one... one!."
"Dissatisfied, disappointed and angry",
Was much hyped turned to be a complete letdown,
"Lazy writing, terrible plot. What multiverse?",
very disappointing,"For me, the first DS was one of the best marvel films and i had high expectations for this movie. But this was a real disaster! The characters, story, plot... everything was really annoying.

And i thought endgame was disappointing. It's shining like gold now compared to this."
Spoilers for Invincible and Doctor Strange,
Don't turned your speculations into expectations,
Worst Marvel Movie Ever!!!!!,A boringly predictable story dresses with stolen ideas from horror classics. Marvel should learn when to stop instead of ruining years of great work. The only thing good about the experience was the popcorn.
Awful movie,"I'm a fan of most MCU movies but this was just awful. CGI fills about 95% of the film, the plot is poor and at times you wonder what multiverse you're in."
Not recommending to see it,The movie was an ad. And especially if you are not familiar with mcu it's literally unwatchable. This should not be a movie and I left the theater with a strong feeling that I should be refunded. It was a bad movie from all perspectives and as a cumberbatch fan well I was at least I think he should step away from the franchise before they tear down what he was building all these years of acting.
Please read my review before disliking it.,"I went to see the movie on the morning (10 am) of the 4th of May and waited two days before making a review in order to see what other people tought of the movie. I was surprised in seeing how many people actually disliked the movie. I get that people have different likings but if you hated the movie because it did not give you an absurd amount of cameos then you shouldn't have overhyped it. I will avoid making spoilers but we got 7 cameos in the movie: 1 in the post credit, 3 normal ones during the movie and 3 massive ones that made canon to the MCU 3 different groups. This is enough cameos for one movie. As for the movie itself I was glued to my seat the whole time, from beginning to end. I would have prefered the original cut of the movie but Marvel needed to reshoot things in order to be able to let kids watch the movie. Same treatment both Morbius and Venom got. Nontheless the movie was able to be dark and violent (if you've seen the movie you know I'm talking about one scene in particular). Another thing I see people complain about were the mothers of America Chavez. I do not care if you dislike LGBT or what, you do you, but hating a movie for a 30 seconds scene it's absurd. I almost forgot,you don't need to see Wandavision before this movie. You will understand things even if you haven't seen it but watching it would make things more clear about Scarlet Witch motivations. On the last note I really liked the music in this movie and loved how you got to see it tie togheter to the visual in some scenes.

So that was my review, feel free to like it or dislike it, your choice."
Just for raimi,
"Really? The all powerful girl's first name is ""America""?","Yeah... no. That took all the buzz out of it and made me cringe too hard to give anyhting above 1*, despite it being an okayish movie.

Whether it was meant as a joke, a statement or anything inbetween or nothing at all: No, stop."
it's like watching the green lantern all over again,"Awful story, forced irrelevant scenes just to tick the boxes for marketing.

No character build up for the Villain . Come on! Even Dormammu had better build up."
Multiverse of nonsense,"Sadly, this movie did not come up to expectations in any way. Weak plot, messy development, bad writing, faulty editing, inconsistent acting... It doesn't sound like an MCU movie to me. Not even the great Benedict Cumberbatch could work out his magic to turn this into something worth watching."
Brings only unjustice to Wanda's persona,"I loved WandaVision for it's very innovative and bold style there Elizabeth Olsen was absolutely amazing. Wanda's origin-somewhat-redemption-arc made me love the character and relate to her grief.

However, I could smell red flags when the first trailer dropped suggesting Wanda as the bad guy so I went into the cinema with low expectations and it was even more bad than I could possibly think.

My biggest issue is that Wanda's personal experiences in the series doesn't seem to matter at all, in MoM she's bad from the get go which makes no sense. I understand that the Darkhold scripts has a possessive force against the reader but in the final shot of WandaVision she could alternate herself from Scarlet Witch, distancing herself from dark magic. I'm surprised Olsen didn't turned down the script, that's how bad this movie is because MoM does only unjustice to Wanda.

The directing is really underperfoming and a big mess so Sam Raimi is nowhere near his prime anymore. Olsen is so stiff it could've been her audition for Maleficent and poor Gomez is a huge miscast. She has no material to work with and fails to bring a connection to the audience. So the whole America character feels meaningless.

The editing is so messy there's no pacing whatsoever due to weird camera angles and sudden midcuts in action sequences. MoM was supposed to be a horror with huge possibilities of the multiverse concept but has no impact at all for the MCU and feels as disappointing as Thor 2 was."
So disappointing,"Was really looking forward to this but it only took about 10 minutes to realise this is not a good film. It's rammed with plot holes and contradictions which seem more blatant than in earlier Marvel film as if the studio doesn't make an effort to keep the plots water tight anymore as they have established their fan base already.

The big baddie is nothing new, in fact the film feels more like an extension to a recent series rather than a Dr Strange film and when it introduces new characters that everyone has been waiting years and years to finally make an appearance they don't use them at all.

The film is a jumbled mess, it's not as bad as the Eternals but sadly not far off."
Horrible movie,
Disappointing mess .,
A cool sequel to Doctor Strange,"The pros of the movie:

1. Awesome visual effects and color palette.

2. Strong acting

3. Sam Raimi's cool directing

4. It has some really cool fan-service

5. The horror elements of the film work well

6. Danny Elfman's score is great

7. It has some genuine heart

The cons of the movie:

1. The pacing is a tad bit too rushed

2. Some of the storytelling techniques feel a little lazy

3. Some of the supporting cast members are a little underused

4. It feels like a movie looked over a tad too much by committee

MY OVERALL THOUHTS ON THE MOVIE: Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a fun summer blockbuster and a worthy addition to the MCU. Although not without its issues."
Frightening MCU addition. Thanks to Sam Raimi,
Someone has been watching Fringe....,"I am not quite sure if this was an ode to Fringe, or that they copied the core storyline. From collapsing universes to falling through the ice.

I hope it was an ode."
Not Doctor Strange 2,"This is not a Doctor Strange movie, This i a Scarlet Witch and America Chavez movie!

The whole movie actually degrades and tears down the Doctor Strange character in multiple universes!

The movie also has issues figuring out what is right and wrong. There is a over uses of macguffins, reminds me of star wars and not in a good way!

The fight scenes reminds me of a bad DC movie where heroes wait their tune to fight. Even if their friend is getting slaughtered in front of their eyes!

If this is the future of the Avengers, then it is going to be a fast down fall of a beloved franchise!"
"""It's Madness, Madness I Tell Ya, For The love Of God!""","Doctor Strange And The Multiverse Of Madness (2022) -

The film should have been called ""Wanda Watches Too Many Episodes Of Sliders And Quantum Leap"". Because essentially that's what it's like.

And how do I write a review for this film without spoilers?

I liked it when that character turned up, but felt that they were under utilised. That other guy was a total DILF and I hope that he comes back in future Marvel films. I also liked that they used that other fella from that series that wasn't so good and reinvented that woman that wasn't so good before either. Oh and Benny's hair was terrible. That's about all that I can say about the story itself.

However, I felt that the whole thing should have been a ""Multiverse"" film that included Dr Strange and not claimed to be about him. That would have let them bring in loads of other characters and created a better story. In fact they could have made a series out of it, where with each episode he lands in a new universe and he has to work with a different team or individual from the Marvel catalogue of heroes and villains to move forward. I wouldn't have minded them doing that to set up new series' and other films.

This one though, really isn't about him, but rather a continuation of the 'WandaVision' (2021) story. If you haven't seen that, then this film won't fully make sense. You may also want to make sure that you've seen the 'What If' (2021) cartoon series before watching it too, although I obviously can't tell you why.

It's a shame, because I really wanted to enjoy this second instalment. The first Dr Strange film felt a bit like something that they had to quickly shoehorn in to production in order to make 'Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame' (2018/9) work.

But I had hoped that the Doc, having been more well established since then, would get a better story for his own sequel, especially after his appearance in 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' (2021), which also has a build in to this story, but not to the same extent as Wanda.

However I felt that because it relied on magic instead of science, the rules are always thrown away a bit. With science fiction, it is based on what can actually be achieved, as far as we as a society currently know, but with magic they've only got to find a new or different spell to get around things and that felt like somewhat of a cop out.

It also lacked some polish, as if they got to the end and the CGI/special effects had cost so much that they couldn't afford the reshoots to take out some of the more corny elements, because some of the acting was quite bad in places.

It actually seemed like a ""Made For TV Special"" from the 90's. It smacked of 'Xena: Warrior Princess' (1995-2001) and 'Hercules: The Legendary Journeys' (1995-9) with some 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' (1997-2011) thrown in.

My Mother watches some of the science fiction and fantasy films (The ones made purely to keep the ex cast members of soap operas in work) that come up on what I call the ""Hallmark"" channels. I have been unfortunate enough to catch one or two of them and they've had a similar construction to this film.

It just felt like the whole film was the productions way to showcase new potential characters, like bringing out new actors at a comicon to gauge the audience's thoughts.

I'd like them to focus on what has been established already and build on that instead of introducing new characters that are so unknown that they don't even feature in the Marvel Encyclopaedia and require a search to the deepest parts of the internet to understand where they have come from. Why not make a film to show how The Avengers are building a new team as a result of their losses? It just seems daft to me.

There was a musical piece in the middle of the film and like that, I would describe this film as a cacophony. It was all too much going on, here, there and everywhere and with too many people. There weren't enough pauses and there were too many explosions, Etc. It is fantastic what can be achieved on a computer, but this just felt like the artists had finally been given a chance to use colours that would normally be left in the paintbox, because they were so unrealistic.

I think that Dr Strange, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, worked nicely as part of an ensemble cast, such as he did in 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame' but he just jars a bit in the character's own stories. The writing just didn't seem to support his acting abilities and it became too comic book.

Also, it's really not worth waiting for the second ""End Credits Scene"". It's totally pointless and has no effect on anything.

It starts in a place where you already feel like you've missed something and that's never a good thing.

541.23/1000."
Weak plot. Lazy writing. A lot of plot holes. Too much focus on Wanda alone,
Ungripping,There was potential but left out Unexecuted.......... Felt like bored. Very ungripping. ..........Multiverse idea was a good one for sequel but didn't felt interesting........ a mess.....
A full-blown Sam Raimi film!,"My biggest fear was that Marvel wouldn't let Sam Raimi do his thing. Thankfully, that's not the case at all. Sam Raimi goes ham on this movie.

A script like this would not have worked in the hands of any other director. Raimi turns what could've been an incomprehensible mess into a visually inventive and occasionally gruesome adventure. The flaws in the script are still there, but the fantastic direction always makes sure you're not thinking too hard about them. This is easily the best directed movie in the MCU.

The movie has fanservice for both Marvel and Sam Raimi fans. There are moments that are clearly direct references to the Evil Dead movies, and a number of comic book characters make suprise appearances.

These moments surprisingly never distracted me from the story, which while often too chaotic for its own good, finds a strong anchor point in the emotional journeys of Stephen Strange and Wanda Maximoff.

I have no idea how this movie will hold up on a rewatch, since it definitely has flaws, but right now, I'm just extremely happy to have an MCU film not afraid to let its director put every bit of themselves on screen."
One time watch,Just watched doctor strange and compare to spider man nwh it wasn't that good and it didn't match the expectations as i thought. You can watch it for 1 time. Mid credit scene is important and don't waste your time for post credit scene.
Too mad and strange for any doctor,"Marvel movies are well-,known in having excellent CGI, great production and plenty of expectation. Unfortunately Marvel has lost its touch in storytelling.

This one is absolute rubbish, at best. Pointless and old fashioned, pumped up with modern FX. ""Bad witch tries to capture good girl while hero uses evil to save the day."" How original!!!

Watch if you're a die-hard fan who has to watch, but you would be better off spending your time watching grass grow."
Too jumpy and so much rush,"This movie can be 90 minutes without any unnecessary sub plot. The extra was good but the background was too jumpy, i even cannot enjoy it.

The horror sense was the only good in this movie and oh good the action is just meh."
Dumbest MCU Movie By Far,"I haven't been this disappointed by an MCU film since Captain Marvel. Random, poorly paced, nonsense, low effort trash. What an absolute waste of a concept.

At least it was funny... not because it was written well but because it was impossible to take seriously. I laughed hysterically at every gruesome death, every lame attempt at horror, and every nonsense, pointless cameo.

I would accept this movie as a masterpiece if it was made purposely as a joke. It's like someone gave a $200,000,000 budget to a fan fiction writer."
Only movie I have walked out of,Hard to write a review for this without cussing. Probably the worst thing I have ever seen. Absolute mess from start to finish. I don't even know what happened aside from the TV-grade level of CGI. Whoever made this needs to rethink their life choices. Asked for my money back even though I did not pay for it.
An incoherent mess,
"Don't watch the movie if you haven't seen WandaVision. If you have, don't watch it then either.","Easily my least favourite Marvel movie ever.

It has every problem marvel movies tend to have but worse. First of all, it relies heavily on you having seen WandaVision for large parts of it. The plot is formulaic. The fight scenes are flashy and nonsensical with no way to know who's winning and absolutely NO TENSION. The character power levels are all over the place like never before. The villain's power without exaggeration goes from Captain Marvel levels to a Scooby Doo villain level and back as the plot requires it. A whole quarter of the movie is there just as a setup for future MCU movies.

In addition to this, the character motivations are skin deep and the villain's is just laughably contrived. Characters break aspects of their character that have been strongly established in the same movie or previous ones. There isn't even any of the usual MCU humor and the few jokes fall flat. The resolution of the movie is just a flat out Deus Ex Machina. The movie heavily emphasizes a part of Strange's character that he needs to change, really beats the audience over the head with it. In the scene where Strange realizes this and displays the personal growth the movie has been hinting at he does it in just about the dumbest way possible, just monumentally stupid. That's the only scene where the character growth is on display other than one detail later.

On the other hand the movie does have lots of flashy colours which are kinda nice, so it gets a two."
A sad Disneyfacation of what could have been a decent film.,
Boring,Agree with a bunch of other reviewers. Dialogue is poor and plot is pretty weak. Not unique or interesting at all. Honestly I would go as far to say that this is one of the worst marvel movies.
Look,The first 15 minutes I was ready to leave and then again when I saw the woman American fighting with her it was a atrocious sight and hilarious but simultaneously chilling for what they try to pass as possible even in another universe it would be impossible and ridiculous to try to suggest that something like that is possible.
I'm glad I saw this in the theater.,"Here's The 4K Lowedown on ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness."" (PG-13 - 2022 - Theater)

Genre: Fantasy/Comic My Score: 9.0

Cast=10 Acting=8 Plot=9 Ending=10 Story=9 Imagine=10 Pace=8 CGI=10 Comic=9 Funny=7

Doctor Strange teams up with a mysterious teenage girl who can travel across the multiverse, to battle multiple threats which threaten to wipe out millions across the multiverse.

""Just because someone stumbles and loses their way doesn't mean they're lost forever."" I'm glad I saw this in the theater...this is definitely a movie for the big screen. I didn't take advantage, but there was even a 3D option...haven't seen that in a while. The cast made this movie for me and their alternate personnas. If you have watched the Disney+ series What If? It can give you some clue about the characters. I can't wait to add this to my physical collection."
Boring,"Here we go again, another overlong boring Marvel film. Poor special effects, no real story to talk about and again throwing in more and more so called superheroes to fill the cast up. I am presuming the scores of 9 and 10 must be entered by the under 20 group. Surely anyone over that age must have more taste than that. Please stop with all these so called blockbusters, and get back to some more entertaining films."
Only Multiverse and no madness,"Expectations were high but the movie was not at Par.

All I want to say is..

Dear Doctor Strange,

Time stone ko ghumao aur mere paise wapis kardo.

I need the 2 hours of my life back."
No words...,"There are no words that convey the utter disappointment that this film is. Completely, utterly, unspeakably, depressingly DISAPPOINTING IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY."
Slow and formulaic,"The first Trivia item says it all: ""Sam Raimi initially didn't want to direct any future superhero films, having lost faith in himself due to the critical and audience backlash he received from Spider-Man 3"". It's amazing what a fat paycheck can get anyone to do, and in this case, it changed Raimi's mind. Too bad, for the audience.

Just like Spider-Man 3, this movie also is burdened with a lot of melodrama, and just like Spider-Man 3, there is an antagonist/villain who, at the end, needs just a little nudge to do the right thing, and bam, they are redeemed. May be Raimi attempts to show that there's good in all of us, but that premise is so naive, wrongly simplistic, and has been done to death since the inception of cinema, that he just ends up producing another snore fest. As an iconic movie character said ""some men just want to watch the world burn"", there isn't always a good side to them waiting to come out with the adequate amount of tears.

The movie is a little over two hours long, and by the time an hour had passed, I was so bored that I started checking social media on my phone (there were no one seating in the rows behind me). I didn't care about Dr. Strange or what happened to any of the other characters. There was no reason to anyway, the movie is a rinse and repeat of the same thing: Dr. Strange fleeing from the villain. When you've seen it once or twice, it just keeps repeating in different universes. The reason behind the villain's onslaught is just unbelievable, other than, of course, they needed to make a movie.

Skip it!"
Wanda in the Multiverse of Sadness,
Trailer 9/10 but The Movie 5/10,
"The movie name should be ""Wanda's multiverse of Madness""","I can't really say how good is this movie. But I find it one sided from the Wanda. May be we expected a lot more from strange's perspective but we dont get so much. ANyway, no spoiler. Before watching the movie, just keep in mind that, this is ""Wanda's multiverse of Madness""."
Pulled the punches,"Pros + Good central plot + New characters are effective + Cumberbatch is on form

Cons
Limited by its 12A rating
More VFX would have been nice - Suicide Squad 2 and Batman look much better than Marvel movies these days
Wanda's motivation isn't entirely believable
Could've made more of the multiverse setting."
Expectations too high,"Marvel started so strong for me and when I heard Sam Rami was in the mix I had high expectations. Only to be shot down to a mediocre movie Dr Strange 2.

There were hints of a good story until America came into the scene with little backstory and a whole lotta of being chased and given chase.

I prefer the ""What if"" series for a decent story."
"Very weak script, dubious direction, effects...","If you watched the first movie, you will surely be disappointed. Everything in this film leaves something to be desired in relation to the previous one. Frankly, I don't know what's going on with Marvel..."
"Raimi's directing skills carry the movie. Without him, this would be even worse.","Actually, I expected many things in the movie before it was released plus all the spots and trailers that hyped me so much. This movie has every Raimi's style, such as, great camera angles, editing, and color grading also the terrifying tone from every Raimi movie. Besides the great things in this movie, it carries bunch of wired dialogues and screenplay. There are lots of plot holes in this movie. In this movie, there are many elements that can be use in the further movies, but they just...like throw it in some bad ways I never understand. So as a MCU fan, this just make me disappointed so much. As I say without Raimi directing style, this will be even worse than this."
Dreams Are A Reality,"We are told very early that dreaming is a way of an alternative reality through multiverse. Xochitl Gomez (America Chavez) has the power of travelling to multiverses at any time, a power desperately wanted by Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) in which a life with kids is desired. Dr Steve Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) travels through many multiverses to save Xochitl as well as from his mulriverse self.

For a two hour film its alot to cram in and the pace rarely takes a breath literally from the beginning of the film. Sam Raimi delivers exceptionally well as the story flows seamlessly well and is visually spectacular.

It was also great to see Wong (Benedict Wong) get more of a chance to show what his character brings to the table. Lovers of Marvel will also love to see some familiar faces cameo too. A solid film that is really enjoyable."
Dr Strange in the Mongoose of Muesli.,"Or Wandavision 2.

Why throw music at each other? Memory shops? Overpowered Wanda? Annoying America gets her deus ex powers at the end? Magic book nonsense? This multiverse nonsense is not a cover up for bad writing.

Sam Raimi adds a little scarier content. Great visuals. That is all."
Great way to begin a new focus in the MCU,"This movie was nothing like any Marvel movie I've seen and you can probably thank Sam Raimi for that. My only complaint with the movie is the fact that there wasn't too much multiverse involved and it felt just a little bit rushed at some parts. But to be fair, this is probably only the start of something much bigger. Can't wait to see what's next for the MCU!"
You break the rules and become the hero. I do it and I become the enemy. That doesn't seem fair.,
Noisy mess and missed opportunity.,"I cannot understand some of these higher ratings. Maybe there are more Sam Raimi fans than I thought, but with the momentum and financial clout Marvel Studios currently has, this shouldn't be seen as anything other than a misfire. The CGI was underwhelming and was in danger of falling into the same trap as the Snyder dross. Action sequences were meh, but it's hard to tell if they were that bad or the constant bombardment of overly dramatic music (worst and most dated and cliched soundtrack to any marvel film to date) just dulled the senses. It just wasn't much of anything - not fun, not scary, not gripping, not clever and was a huge waste of the two main leads talent. 5 out of 10 was as kind as I could be but novelty and nods to fans will never replace good story telling."
Half way in between horror and adventure,"Multiverse is just a base concept to weigh Wanda and Strange characters. Along with them Chavez was introduced and who cares her, it's all between the powers of Wanda and a bit of strange.

The multiverse is just being teased and not wide into the concept. The scenes and emotions were delivered very well and the issues like incursion, dream walk were explained neatly.

Sam Raimi has done very good justice as always and his speciality horror was very limited - else this can't be a PG13 movie. It's one good thing from Marvel to produce movies for this category instead of R rated movies.

Music and picturisation is good as always.

The inclusion of fantastic 4 and X men people have cleared the the gates between the other series or sequences. We can expect more in the upcoming movies."
Created an account just to share this,"This movie was an absolute mess. From the plot lines to the inconsistent character motivations. It had huge potential but fell short by a mile.

They threw away all the character development from all the previous films and Disney+ series to shove in as many random sequences as possible.

I was really looking forward to this instalment but the whole thing left me feeling like Marvel created this as an easy cash grab. All the character cameos felt cheap and were a wasted opportunity to really build out the world."
Raimi did a tribute to.. himself..,"This film feels like a tribute of Raimi's films which of course is done by himself for himself.. I know some people like it but I didn't..

Also this film was a 'halloween' film so it's a bit like 6 months off the mark? Not sure why they needed to release it now.. probably cuz of covid but there we go. I'm sure it'll become a halloween staple.

The CGI of the octopus monster fight (it's in the trailer) was cartoonish and reminiscent of the 60s CGI.. if that was intentional then count me out.

Elizabeth Olsen was mesmerising, Cumberbatch looked constantly constipated but I liked the cameos albeit I'm not a fan of how it was directed..

It was watchable I guess. I think the best thing in the film was the joke about spiderman.. you'll know when you hear it."
Sam Raimi in the The Multitask of Business,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, the latest cinematic entry from the MCU, delivers great CGI visuals, fantastic action sequences, and the occasional signature trademarks from Evil Dead director Sam Raimi.

It is a crowd-pleasing popcorn film that rewards the most faithful fans who have kept up with all the films, recent TV shows, and the animated What If with tremendous fan service.

In the end, the Multiverse of Madness is standard Marvel fare that does not deliver the promise its glorious movie title suggests. The script buckles under its weight serving different masters being a Doctor Strange sequel, a WandaVision sequel, a Sam Raimi film, and another chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

First off, Michael Waldron's script took me by surprise. The trailers lead me to think the story was about something else than what we got, which was oddly smaller in scope than I expected.

Like The Big Bang progressing to the theorized inevitable Big Crunch, the weight of the ever-expanding Marvel Universe is starting to cave in at the expense of the story, especially with the inclusion of a multiverse. These movies are starting to feel like weekly visits to the comic book store and reading a serial story with no end. I'm wary about that as that was why I stopped reading comic books serially in the first place and switched to graphic novels.

Benedict Cumberbatch is a captivating actor and has made the Stephen Strange character his own, steering away from similarities to Tony Stark. Elizabeth Olson gives her best performance yet as Wanda Maximoff. The script gives her lots to play and she has the most range out of the cast.

Sam Raimi's trademark B-movie horror movie elements are a breath of fresh air and fun. There are moments of terror and distress that parents should be aware of before taking children below the age of ten. When the horror sets in, it is treated like a contractually obligated time slot for Sam Raimi to take his turn and contribute his portion, as if the studio was saying, ""We did our bit, Sam. Now it's your turn. Go!""

The first Doctor Strange was one of my favorite MCU solo films with the best cast full of character actors, trippy visuals, and firmly established an arc for Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange to grow in his next solo outing.

Although these story elements are rightfully in place, The Multiverse of Madness does not pick up where the first movie left off satisfyingly. I wanted a deeper exploration of Doctor Strange as a character. What we got, the ""Are you happy, Doctor Strange?"", was telegraphed and unearned. This felt more of a sequel to Doctor Strange after the events of Infinity War and Spider-Man: No Way Home. I ultimately didn't feel the story was as emotionally compelling as the first Doctor Strange and it loses that initial earnestness, despite all its fun action sequences."
Marvel will write the end soon,
Hmmmmmm...,Well I'll admit I didn't know what this movie would entail since I hadn't seen any of the trailers. But I will say it was not what I expected. And it isn't a good thing in this case. So many things were going on in this movie and I believe the director just wanted to put in as many crazy scenes as possible. I wish they would have left things as is after End Game and leave us with an actual ending.
Probably watch this one when it's on streaming services,
The Perfect Chaotic Mess Rather Madness,
Disappointed after watching the movie,"The movie has so many weak points especially its story line. They kept introducing stuff without even explaining about it. No plot, weak story and movie feel like it's rushed."
Zero rating would do justice,"This is one of the worst movies in the Marvel universe. The new actress who plays America Chavez is super annoying. The first Doctor Strange is a much better movie and its sequel does not hold a candle to it. One would expect the storyline to continue from where the first Doctor Strange left off, but that never happens. All you get is a poor attempt by Sam Raimi at making a horror film reminiscent of his Evil Dead days, and less of a Doctor Strange movie. Don't waste your money and time on this one."
Too much of everything - falls completely flat,"Genuinely one of the worst movies I have ever seen in the cinema.

They tried to do everything at once, most of it was overdramatic and character development was unfortunately cut short."
Hated every second of it,This movie was absolutely painful to sit through. Start to finish it was nonsense. Literally CGI vomit for 2 hours. Wanda is the most annoying character that has ever existed and Chavez is a close second.
We are in the endgame now..,
So so boring...,"A boring convoluted mess. They turned Wanda into the most powerful being in the universe with no explanation. Then proceeded to make up stuff as it went along. A collection of Marvel characters doing random stuff to fit the story. No rules, no limitation, no drama, just made up magic powers playing out, quite randomly, to fill a 2 hour window.. jokes aside, seriously that's really all this movie is."
Multiverse of Blankness & Convenient Storytelling,
The IMAX version is amazing!,"I liked Doctor Strange 2 more than the first one. The IMAX version is quite epic. I did not really like the story line, but I liked the effects of the movie. The movie is dark and I'm waiting for the next Doctor Strange movie!

Amazing. 9/10."
All CGI no story,"What can I say. Basically all CGI no new story just a continuation of Wanda Vision. Did this really need to be made?

Really nothing more to say but need to add more words."
Horror Meets Marvel in a wild romp,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is incredible! Sam Raimi brings his old school Horror directing style and melds it perfectly into the MCU creating a world of both action and terror, with just enough humor and some powerful emotion sprinkled in.

If you wanted Disney's MCU to expand into something more dark, gory and intense, this is your film. With nods to the evil dead series and drag me to hell, wild imagery, death and mayhem, Raimi provides you a Marvel film that's never been done before. One that borders more on Horror first while still keeping the adventure and action fun! There are Surprises at every corner!

I couldn't recommend it higher! What a ride! Absolutely beautiful!

PS - Look for a fun cameo by the great Bruce Campbell!"
Too Much Raimi,"Too much Raimi. Way, waaaay too much. Just call it Evil Dead 4, with superheroes. Probably some of the worst CGI I've seen in a Marvel film to date. Xochitl Gomez was the lone shining spot in this film. Too much campy overacting from usually wonderful actors. No wonder Derrickson walked away from making this film; terrible script."
What?,
Amazing and Inovative,This movie was just amazing. With beautiful camera work and spectacular special effects. Sam Raimi actually inovated in the Marvel Universe by showing its dark side.
Easily,One of disney studios best made marvel movies! They don't insult your intelligence or dumb the characters down like most here you get them unfiltered and true to form! Was a pleasure to watch!
Elizabeth Olsen is just on par,"The movie is different and unique. The horror element is surprising, the plot runs very fast to accommodate emotions but the cast expect the actor who played American Chevez do make a huge impact."
Madness,"Doctor Strange 2 is the MCU's latest balls-to-the-wall crossover event, and it's noticeably not as well done as everything else was in Spider-Man: No Way Home. The effects and action are nice, but the story squanders a palpable script in favour of frustratingly fragmented (which multiverses can suffer from when stories don't address all the inherent issues of multiple worlds directly interacting with each other) fan-service and even more sequel-fodder with its abrupt cliff-hanger ending (pre-post-creds mind you, but still)."
season 8 ep 6 of GoT,The movie took the character arch same as season 8 ep 6 of GoT forget the character buildup in Wandavision show and just make her goofy without explaining why.
"If viewed without the MCU, it's a classic horror film","With all these multiverses and metaverses floating around at non-Newtonian, non-Euclidean, or monetized angles, it's a wonder anyone finds time to get out of bed and put pants on to defeat quasi-existential threats of any kind, time, place, manner, matter, or criss-crossed platform. The title drops another clue that we might be in store for a Cthulhu or two, certainly a movie rife with Sam Raimi's personal love-touches which are sure to include that crafty Bruce Campbell.

Some have suggested this Doctor Strange is a full-service fan-job, yet the darkness of the horror is playful and the names of the characters or their origins are irrelevant to this tale, just as it would not matter what Cthulhu's house looks like or what Cthulhu does in its leisure time. The core question within all of the versions of ourselves is whether we have lived our lives with proper gusto and thus moved the cosmic needle. If so, we then ask what that means, blow up some buildings, insert a denouement, wipe the smudges off our 3-D glasses, and rebuild back better based on Lessons Learned.

Thankfully, there is left open the distinct possibility that there exists some version of a Spider-Man with the ability to shoot webs from his (or her or its or their) butt(s)."
Marvel indoctrination movie,"I miss the time when Marvel made movies to entertain us instead to indoctrinate us with diversity ideology. A Latin kid with two mothers, give me a break.

Also, it isn't enough anymore to watch all the Marvel movies to understand the story. No, now the audience is expected to watch the streaming stuff on Disney+, too. If you haven't seen the series WandaVision on Disney+, you will have a hard time to understand Doctor Strange 2. I know all the previous movies, but I don't watch Disney+ and now I don't understand the new movies anymore. This is unacceptable!"
"Yeah, I agree. This was pretty meh.","I never got a chance to see this movie in theatres, but since it was released I did notice lots of expressions of disappointment toward this film. Initially I thought that the hate was probably exaggerated due to there not being as many special cameos as people had expected, and was still excited diving into this to watch a Marvel movie about the multiverse, starring Doctor Strange (loved the first movie, btw). As it turns out, this movie really is pretty blah.

I've seen some people say it could have been better, but I disagree. With what they were trying to do with this movie, there is no universe where it would have been much better. Maybe titled differently, such as ""The Scarlett Witch VS Doctor Strange"", in which case it may have been received a bit better. Because at its core this is just a throwaway idea for an MCU movie about MCU characters, with barely any other depth to it, and with like 15% of multiverse thrown into there.

Gotta give it credit where it's due though, I thought America Chavez was a surprisingly likeable new character, with cool powers. Plus, some visuals were really cool. And for the ideas this movie had, it did most of them well. But the ideas just weren't good enough, and there was a strong lack of substance."
No idea what that was all about...,"As I write IMDB has this scored at 7.4, how that's possible is beyond me. Can't be anything other than Marvel fanboys (and girls) hitting it up. I love a good superhero film but unfortunately for me this wasn't. It seems like a bit of a misstep in the Marvel universe. Don't get me wrong, it looks AMAZING, and the cast all do a great job, especially Elisabeth Olsen who brings genuine menace to the role of the scarlet witch. The story however is either directionless or so convoluted that your left scratching your head. The introduction of certain characters seems completely shoehorned in because after all look at the buzz the multiverse Spider-men caused so let's do it again. There's probably a good movie in there somewhere but I struggled to see it."
Too silly to be taken seriously,"Hey people liked retro Spider-Man cameos. So let's make another multiverse movie and have character cameos for the sake of having them.

Add in some horrible dialog that you can almost see Cumberbatch forcing himself to say without rolling his eyes.

I didn't like the plot. Didn't like the dialog. And basically found myself laughing at some really cringy and dumb moments. One of the dumbest character deaths ever filmed in the MCU happens mid movie. Worst MCU movie so far."
It's not good,It's got 30% Sam raimi - 70% Disney marvel.......the movie is NOT good - if you don't believe it - watch the movie but it's not good - the story is senseless (maybe because it's Disney marvel who decide what goes into these movies even when they have good directors.......) the CGI is not good - I see so many people agreeing with me - but this is BAD marvel......not even mid road marvel - I think the only thing it will be remembered for is being a bad movie in the marvel cinematic universe!!!!!!
This is not how you make a Multiverse,"Save yourself some time to watch a real good multiverse movie and go watch ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"".

Marvel movies are going down... How can you let Sam Raimi in without letting him properly make his movie."
I love Sam Raimi,"This is it. Regardless of the plot, the new characters, whatever - the fact that we have all the Sam Raimi things is just amazing.

At times it was overwhelming - felt like too many ideas at once.

And the ending was very meh..."
Huge disappointment,The amazing Spider-Man that you have is amazing to have a great weekend with you guys all good night and I love it too but I'm just not feeling good but I'm going back in a few days so I'm going back in a little while I have a few things for me and my dad to have to get a new doctor in the hospital for the week of surgery and then he will have a good time and I have to go back in time and he is in the office for the rest of the day.
I'll be the odd man out,"I did not like this movie. They included so many MC characters with no real value other than to represent, I expected Action Figure G. I. Joe and Barbie to make an appearance. The girl with the 'greatest power of all time"" didn't even get to use it. It was simply too much! Too much CGI, too much of everything. No realprogress on Jason & Christine plot. And soon Charlize Theron will kick some ass (by waving her arms around?). Oh boy.

As it was 95° outside, at least we spent 3 hours in air conditioning and had good food at the drafthouse theater."
A mess... with occasionally good moments,"The bad:

The script is a complete mess Plenty of gratuitous terrible woke inserts

The good:

The music fight - which is highly original Zombie Strange Evil Wanda

Honestly I'm left kinda empty after watching it. The cameos fly past... the box ticking. It's all vacuous in the end and mostly doesn't make sense. I get it. Sometimes directors want to do go for a cool visual and ditch logic, but at least make an effort. This is mostly tiring to watch.

Should you see it? I'd recommend giving it a miss to be honest, or catch it when it hits a streaming service.

The MCU hit its peak with Infinity War and tied that up with End Game.

But the movies and TV shows you are seeing now are long after Disney sunk its claws in and infected the movies/shows from the start. It's not worth saving now.

Remember it as it was."
Definitely worth the wait!!!!!!!!,"I watched this movie Friday night thought I would let it digest for a couple of days, three things I can tell you without spoiling it. 1 it's got great comic adaptation as a fan of doctor strange and his comics I was pretty happy, 2 it's crazy it's nothing like other marvel movies so don't go in expecting what you think, finally 3 it's got healthier level of horror that makes this unique and epic in its own way. Sam Raimi really has made something quite extraordinary, I definitely do not have the guts to direct a film on any level like Sam did.

Remember to watch the film in cinema for the best experience, if you have already been spoiled by others I really am sorry for you. I definitely think you should go watch it get your own take of it.

Definitely worth a second time watching. That's it that is my spoiler free review. Thanks for reading."
"Great Film, Don't Know Why People are Complaining","Again, as I always say when other people write terrible reviews about films that are actually really good, watch it for yourself and you decide.

This is a great film from the very start with loads of action and intrigue. Yes Wanda is in it and she plays a key role in the film but the main forums is still around Dr Strange, who is again played excellently by Benedict Cumberbatch.

Personally I think it is one of the better Marvel films, probably the best for a couple of years. Don't listen to all the negative nellies and give this film a watch, you won't regret it."
Watch WandaVision before you watch this movie,"I think the movie is amazing, and quite different from other MCU movies. Sam Raimi has inserted some horror elements into the movie, but I don't think it fits the movie too well. He also used some weird music choice and shooting technique which I am not a fan of

As usual, the cast is doing a great job, especially Elizabeth Olsen *cough who is my new crush after WandaVision cough*, and without saying, Benedict Cumberbatch as well. There are a few dreams come true moments, without any spoiler, there will be a few main Marvel characters ""introduced"" in the movie, for one of them is an actor who is highly anticipated and requested by fans to be casted for his role. #hype

Without spoiling any thing to ruin the surprise, there is nothing much I can say about the movie. The movie is not the best MCU film, but definitely my top 5. I would give 8.5/10 but IMDB rating has no option for that.

On an important note, you MUST watch WandaVision before watching this movie or else you wouldn't understand some of the important things."
"Must watch for Wanda fans, but otherwise..",
Doctor Strange: in the Multiverse of Madness,"Whatever your thoughts are about Marvel you have to give them credit for their worldbuilding and character development. Wanda and Dr. Strange are both very unique and gray characters which makes them fun. The actors also do a great job portraying their characters.

Marvel has never been this dark before. I'm honestly surprised it hasn't got a higher age limit. But it's great with darker content. Marvel has for a long time felt too childish but this feels more real and got a stronger effect.

The multiverse is a very confusing subject and it can ruin movies, but it can also make them more fun. This movie did a good job not making it too confusing while also utilizing it and creating fun fanservice.

Like the previous Doctor Strange movie, the visual effects are spectacular and breathtaking. There are some scenes which are not quite as believable but it doesn't take the viewer out of the movie.

The problem with these powerful magic characters is that they are too overpowered. There's a lot of plot armor, but it's almost impossible to avoid when you're playing with these powerful heroes. The magic can be a bit convoluted at times, but just remind yourself that it's a movie. Don't try poke holes at every plothole or stupid decision. Just have fun because it's a fun movie."
You don't know what you're up against!,"Surprising, funny, cool, a bit scary (in a good way)!! This movie was AWESOME if you like marvel or fantasy/Sci-Fi movies in general you should definitely watch just make sure you watch the great show WandaVision to better understand the plot of MoM!!"
"Got better as it went along, and I had fun overall","After it was announced Sam Raimi was directing this, I was cautiously optimistic. Thanks the the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man trilogy, he was well-versed in directing superhero movies, and with the hype around this Doctor Strange sequel having supernatural horror elements, it sounded like he could flex some of his Evil Dead-ish magic, too.

But then I heard sort of mixed things about this, when it first released, and I lowered my expectations. That led to me being pleasantly surprised by this in the end, as I thought it was very good (for the most part). It doesn't always utilise its multiverse premise to its full potential (doesn't help that Everything Everywhere All At Once just perfected what a multiverse movie could be last month), and it doesn't have the most satisfying story.

But in the moment, I thought it was a lot of fun, had some great visuals, solid performances all around, and plenty of Sam Raimi's signature style. Being a big fan of his, I loved how much of this felt like his movie, as I know that sometimes, a director's style gets drowned out in these sorts of big budget blockbusters.

I will say, the story did Chiwetel Ejiofor dirty, as I swear the first Doctor Strange set him up to have a big role somewhere down the road. And while I think Wanda was used well, they didn't really address where Vision was? Which seemed odd, seeing as this seemed to build off WandaVision.

But in the end, there was too much I liked about this to be too disappointed. I think it avoids the disappointing final act problem that a lot of MCU movies fall into, too. It's pretty good stuff overall, and watching it made for a good time."
"Multiverse of madness, Scarlet Witch Madness",
"Until credits start rolling, you won't believe the movie has ended","I was not bored even for a minute. But near the actual end, I just kept thinking, there must be more, no way Strange's solo movie can end like this. I genuinely thought it was a false flag op by Sam Raimi, you know the kind where the Godzilla suddenly raises up and we get to see 30 minutes more of the movie, the meat of the movie. But, to my utter disappointment, the credits started rolling. It felt like first half of an excellent movie instead of a full movie.

To make it worse, neither the climax nor the post credit scenes got me half as much excited as I used to get before Endgame. If this is the plight of a Strange's movie, I guess MCU's devolution has begun.

PS: Strange saying 'Things just got out of the hand' in the trailer was either missing in the movie or I missed it somewhere in the middle."
Fast and furious!,At breakneck speed this movie goes balls to wall and I'm so here for it! Wanda is the MVP! Curious to see if the cameos lead to anything more. Definitely ups the scare factor on this one.
Fun,"Not sure whatelse you want from a marvel movie ! Great visuals, story, and editing. Benedict (both of them) act with such ease. It also has some jumpy moments. I'll stop , just watch it."
I little bit disappointing,"Are there aspects of the movie that could have been improved? Sure, the script struggles sometimes, and there are weird moments just to be weird without adding anything to the overall story or character development. On the other hand, the movie offers a very good soundtrack and amazing performance by some of the actors."
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,
America chaves and Wandas schizofrenia,
5/10,"Watched it today. Didn't like it. The story was weak, but the special effects saved the movie a little. Too many universes too hard to keep up to the story."
DC's ArrowVerse done the MultiVerse better.,"Its basically a horror movie Wanda vs Dr Strange is awesome.

Wong is fine.

America Chavez is meh.

Special effects are brilliant!

Cameos are good but wasted.

Dont bother with End Credits.

No Loki considering its about the multiverse

No multiverse cameos from old marvel movies like Magneto, Quicksilver, Wolverine, Deadpool, Vision, Ghost-Rider, Blade or Spider-Man."
"Bizarre, nonsensical plot","It's surprising to see a 7+ rating. Read the latest and most helpful reviews for a better picture. The plot barely made any sense so often left you clueless, even after having seen all the past marvel films. It felt like a huge waste of time to have watched it.

It's still very entertaining to read the user reviews of the film."
Insulting to the Intelligence,
Boring movie. Huge disappointment.,"Boring movie. I had tickets booked for ReadD-3D, IMAX, DOLBY and IMAX-3D in that order. That's how much I was excited for this movie but it turned out to be a huge disappointment 😥 😢. So right after I saw this movie in RealD-3D I canceled rest all of the shows."
Underwhelmingly unversed,Watching the movie gave me a feeling of it being rushed and seemingly a lot was left on the cutting room floor. The ending left me unsatisfied and with a difinete 'That's it?' feeling in my gut. It just seemed like the trailer and even the title of the movie promised more multi than we actually got.
Is Sam Raimi the best MCU director?,
"Stellar direction, clumsy writing.","Sorry for the long review, but this is a strange one. I have a lot to say.

The MCU now has its first horror film. And it's director Sam Raimi REALLY elevates the material above the standard superhero fare that's on the page.

With Raimi's experience directing horror comedies, he adds an incredibly fun sensory experience to every scene in the film. The action is over-the-top and even the dramatic scenes have a distinctly heightened visual and auditory nature to them that makes them far more impactful and made me feel something.

Raimi also makes the villain legitimately scary as she brutally tears through her enemies. There are some very effective jump scare sequences that never feel cheap; they always elevate tension and the sense of danger. This has some of the most intense, graphic violence I have ever seen in a PG-13 movie. This movie is NOT for the young children.

This film's other strength is in its villain. Wanda's development is handled far better in this movie than it was in Wandavision, and even though her decisions are irrational, we clearly understand them. She's in the top-tier of MCU villains.

This is where the positives end, unfortunately, because the writing in this movie is largely abysmally idiotic.

The plot is almost entirely contrived and treats its characters like intellectually bereft morons. Just about every single event in the film happens because characters do what the plot needs them to and not what any actual person with half a brain would do.

Every character except Wanda is simply a plot device and does not add the emotional weight to the story that they should have. In fact, this story is almost entirely driven by a series of objects that need to be obtained and the human heart that should be there only shows up occasionally.

The pacing in this movie is also so sloppy. The entire middle portion of the story consists of characters waiting for something to happen, and a pseudo-courtroom drama ensues that is completely irrelevant to the main story. I found myself just wanting the signature Raimi fast pace to come back.

It's a mixed bag of a movie, but there's definitely more to like than not to like, and I praise it for actually having a distinct atmosphere-like an artist was behind the camera rather than just some executives trying to churn out another episode of the MCU."
Don't waste your money on this!!,I don't know what to say...there isn't anything of substance to even criticize...the only thing I do remember from this movie is 'zooming into someone's eye' scenes...
Visually stunning but weak script,Multiverse of Madness suffers from a weak script and wasting some potential characters. But this visually stunning spectacle offers much violence and a lot of Sam Raimi magic.
'WHAT IF' Had a Better Story,
"Not the best, but decent","Don't understand all the hatred towards this film. Don't get me wrong, it's not the greatest marvel film, but definitely not the worst. Very violent, and maybe not the best MCU film for kids. I think the movie would have benefited from being another 30 min to develop some of the scenes better, so the impact would have hit home better. Some of the scenes that were supposed to be emotional didn't really hit home for me."
Blown away by this movie,"When I heard Sam raimi was directing this movie, I had no idea how much horror would be in it. I love the twists, I love the refreshing violence and horror parts. The acting is spectacular and the direction stands out significantly from other MCU movies. I appreciate it isn't for everyone and my opinion in the minority, but I absolutely loved this movie. Good job marvel."
Dr. Strange or how to learn stop worrying and love the multiverse of madness.,
I loved it.,
A Mess of Garbage,"You know when a movie is so bad you don't care about spoilers when you tell someone about it?

That was this movie.

The story is bad. Full of plot holes. The forced characters we are suppose to feel empathy and emotion for. The forced LGBTEQUILA/gender/woke garbage.

Spider-man: No Way Home has no ties or relevance to this movie. Dr Stranges action in No Way Home are not relevant to this movie. It is not a continuation.

Newly introduced characters have zero bearing on the movie and no future purpose to the MCU. They were irrelevant.

Multiverse of Madness just made me angry.

Please, do not waste your time with this movie."
Can we stop these movies now please?,"If the MCU was an album this would be an album filler you'd listen to once out of respect for the musicians you love but never listen to again.

A bad B-side single whatever you want to call it this is just terrible from frame one.

Avoid."
Pointless,"Besides being boring, it was silly and stupid, poor and silly performance from all actors, silly script, stupid plot, and way too many characters that I got lost who is who. And getting those extra marvel characters didn't make it any better. This was a complete waste of time and money."
I think Strange Picked the Wrong Reality to jump to.,"When it was announced that Sam Rami would be directing this film my hopes were high. I really enjoyed his work on Evil Dead films and the series, the original Spiderman Trilogy, and his work on the first Darkman movie.

But the film turns out to be a bit of a mess and really struggles to find a focus point and just jumps from scene to scene, while filled with good visual effects character moments, and easter egg moments. The film struggles to maintain a balance of character and pacing.

I give this a 5 out of 10 because that's how I felt after the movie ended, no different from when I sat down to watch. ( Though the Bruce Campbell cameo made me smile)"
DO NOT LISTEN TO BAD REVIEWS,"Absolutely blew my mind! I went in expecting to be disappointed because of the early reviews and concerns of it being only 2 hours! But wow!!! It was beyond what I expected! Coming from someone who is a huge marvel and comics fan along with horror this movie was a piece of art!!! As someone who thought spider man no way home was peak, this blows spider man no way home out the park! They didn't hold back at all Sam really did a great job putting his expert horror style into this! The cast was incredibly! Gomez as America Chavez is undoubtedly going to be one of the huge faces of marvel in the future she did an amazing job and made the character impossible not to like and root for! Olsen of course played the scarlet witch as expected making her horrifying in every second of the film! And of course Dr strange showcasing his raw power and his true kindness that not everyone sees, he might be one of the most hubris heroes but his genuine concern and protection of America Chavez showed why he is a true hero!!! The Illuminati scene was insane and easily showed the raw massive power that the scarlet witch holds. The only only thing I would change would be to make it 30 min to 1hour longer! It was so packed with non stop action and story telling I feel like more time would've allowed to give a little more and a little less of a bit rushed ending! Regardless it goes down on my list on top 3 marvel movies/comic book movies of all time!!!"
Sam Raimi's direction is tight with a more visceral approach.,"This movie has horror elements and is ghoulishly weird ;that may keep it out of the top of the plebeians MCU list, good thing I'm not a pleb, make no mistake about it, this is one of my favorites ! I guarantee the suits got involved a toned down what Raimi probably really wanted but .......Sam Raimi is back in full horror mode ""to best of his ability"" with the MCU's latest installment , Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. This is a very different Marvel movie than whatever has come before it in both tone, action, and comedy, all hailing from the maestro of comedy-horror movies ,Sam Raimi. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness echo creative choices from Raimi's The Evil Dead films, Army of Darkness, Darkman, and even Drag Me To Hell. I own all four films on Blu-ray disc. This movie is sensory overload to watch it all unfold. If you like your science fiction with a heavy dose of first class CGI , it is mind blowing in this film.

This sequel takes place a few months after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home that follows Doctor Strange crossing paths with a young woman named American Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), who has a super unique power that catches the eyes of every one of the Mystic Arts. Xochitl Gomez is a scene stealer !

It turns out that there is an evil demon hot on her pursuit that wants to drain her power and take over all universes. This sets the course for Doctor Strange and America to travel the multi-verse in search of safety and an ancient book the Darkhold (Classic Raimi ! Remember the Necronomicon in the Evil Dead film series) that might be the key to stopping this evil.

There are some great characters and cameos that show up, along with Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) back in action since her stint on the popular Wanda Vision Disney+ TV show. Raimi uses these cameos well and is not just a one-note, few-second reveal. I do not watch trailers if I don't have to or read reviews I like to go in blind to most movies I see , so I was tickled pink with some of the nostalgic cameos it really was well done. One in particular was over the top for me as a fan of her work. I will just reveal one ,like any one on this forum really cares anyway or my thought for that matter indulge me . Wait till you see Haylay Atwell's bad a s s costume !

You will just have to watch the movie to see all of the nods and winks that Raimi packs into this film.

Doctor Strange may have gotten top billing but this is just as much a movie about Wanda Maximoff of Earth 616 (aka the main MCU) , and (Elizabeth Olsen) came to play ! She was the highlight of the film. Olson turned on the her dark and brooding; not afraid to get bloodstained. Did she ever look fabulous on the IMAX screen is (approximately 62 by 82 feet) in 3D no less.

This film has many things going for it . It is outside the box far from the formulaic and usual pattern of a movie in the MCU , amazing production value , very talented cast chalked full of fun cameos and fan service . Action-packed sequences, dives deep into multitude of multiverses . Sam Raimi's direction is tight with a more visceral approach. Most of all this is an entertaining piece of Sci-fi most fans of the genre should enjoy.

And mid credit scene had a very nice Cameo surprise !"
Raimi thought he was doing Evil Dead,"Raimi couldn't figure out if he was doing an Evil Dead movie or superhero movie. There are multiple tonal shifts, none of which work. The attempt at humor rarely works and is thrown in awkward scenes where humor doesn't belong. The dialogue is atrocious. Did they hire some random copy assistant to write this? I was very disappointed. Some people are convincing themselves this was a good movie because they don't want to admit this is the downslope of the MCU. There is still hope but this movie is not a step in the right direction."
"Watchable, but barely","I am not happy.

This is the single weakest movie I have seen in the marvel franchise. Note that it is the first Movie that I think I have seen after the takeover. I loved Dr. Strange's first movie so I saved this as a litmus test.

Why am I unhappy?

This entire story has already been published in a different Marvel series.

More specifically, it was a ten to twenty minute short story. One of the 'Marvel's What If' episodes.

The only difference is the first thirty minutes of needless action sequences at the beginning. The mediocre backstory dialogue. The next thirty minutes of 'action' although I would have to say watching the second sequences and labeling it 'action' is a bit of a stretch.

It is literally a curb stomp, followed by a complete repetition of the earlier dialogue. Just in case you missed it.

What's my point? They fit the entire story in a twenty minute episode and then tried to force me to watch a two hour version.

Want the full spoiler? Find the ""Marvel's what if"" Episode 4 and then watch this movie. The script is identical.

One is far cheaper and doesn't waste your time.

One has a lot of unnecessary action sequences that made me wonder why I am watching this."
"Cameo galore(kinda), but enough to be a solid follow-up.",
"Almost non-stop mystery, action, thriller and dark magic...","I really liked the movie. Apart from Guardians of the Galaxy and last two Avengers movies, this is my favorite! I wondered why this movie received low IMDB rating and I have read the reviews. These comments are insane and non-realistic! Some reviewers claim that the movie is boring.. Really? Same says it is the worst MCU movie... Come on, be serious! The only unnecessary part was illuminati scenes and the stupid fight (except Dr. Xavier) and the very first scene.

This is a non-stop thriller! I loved the subtle humor, dark magic, multiverses, incredible and perfect CGI, Wanda's unexpected interaction with her kids, and everything else!

Wanda's obsession with connecting with her other kids seemed a little bit silly at first. However, she lost parents, then her brother, she killed her lover Vision, and sacrificed her kids in Wanda Vision. Hence, her obsession actually make sense. Her sacrifice at the end was the most reasonable outcome, but could use a couple more minutes to make it more meaningful and emotional.

My rating is 10/10, an average fair rating should have been around 8.5."
Amazing visuals!,"I went to see the movie in 4Dx 3D, best decision ever! I was not bored for a single second of this movie, it's a very entertaining watch. The storyline seems even rushed for a two and a half run, acting is a little off from the side characters, Benedict Cumberbatch carried the movie perfectly, dr. Strange is more human than in any other appearance, plenty of surprises and laughs , anticipation and horror. All in all, a mood lift and worth a watch, and that is coming from someone who isn't that big of a Marvel fan. Well done!"
One of the most visually mind bending and awesome ride.,Will try best to give non spoiler review : The film is very impressive and at a time like these when there was a lot going in the world managing a concept of such complexity and yet delivering it in a very simple way so it's is believable and understandable by a wider audience is just the job Rami can do with a Rami magic thoose mind bending shots thoose world's it took us through the sometime not scary like Friday the 13th or nun level horror elements it was an awesome pg-13 ride something different and more magical then science yet having science element it was something special i know if he had time in his hand and if we had better circumstances we could have seen the best version of doctor stranges. The advertisement and fan theroies have built a lot of crazy expectations but it was an empowering and a setting up of a something much big event i can feel it and my curiosity is at peak. Ignore the hate and critics we want rank for the third one entering dark domain with Clea and ghost rider i hope it happens well done guys the cast the writters and all the artists and crew for this special treat watched it 8th times beating my previous record for doctor strange and infinity war and Spiderman no way home .
Sam Raimi knocked it out of the park.,"Incredible. Raimi's directing of this film made it, imo, the best Dr. Strange movie to-date.

It is a bit darker, but I loved that because it gave it that much more of an edge and the way it was orchestrated was what made it such a magical experience in cinematic beauty."
Unbearable Script. Another Xmen3. Bad horror movie.,
Proof that Marvel is done,
Victim of expetations,
More woke nonsense,"Yet another trite marvel movie overly pushing ""the message"" This is boiler plate movie fodder designed for the lowest common denominator.

Lazy writing, confusing narrative, and overuse of CGI."
A case of too many cooks in the kitchen,"This movie is one mish mash of a salad! So many elements all coming together, and the final dish is a mix of flavours and textures. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It leaves the viewer confused, dazed and overwhelmed. It may have worked in the most recent Spiderman, but it falls somewhat flat here with Dr Strange. The inclusion of Wanda as the main antagonist, together with elements such as the Fantastic Four and X-men reminds me of a kitchen where different cooks would throw in a vegetable or a fruit or something into a pot and hope it turns out ok. Well, it didn't. The only saving grace was the chemistry between the two Bens, Benedict Cumberbatch and Benedict Wong that kept the movie sane and balanced. Other than that, this ranks as one of the inconsequential movies of the Marvel universe."
"Underwhelming, boring, predictable and full of bad acting","I expected the new doctor Strange movie to as exciting and enjoyable as the first but like most sequals it was extremely underwhelming.

This movie failed to encapsulate me for a moment with its unbelievable storyline and terrible writing. Everything from the terrible performance of actress Xochitl Gomez to its crap CGI makes this an automatic skip, don't bother watching."
Sam Raimi returns in his own unique way as the director of a superhero movie.,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is the sequel to the first Doctor Strange movie from 2016. This sequel is directed by Sam Raimi, the director of Spider-Man and The Evil Dead. In the film, Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Wong (Benedict Wong) must protect the girl America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) from demonic forces, who try to make America her own to travel between universes. To better protect America, Doctor Strange asks Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) for help, but America's uncontrollable powers end up traveling across universes. Here, in these unknown worlds, they must continue to protect America from the evil that travels after them.

With this film, Sam Raimi returns after 9 years as a director and after 15 years also as a director of a superhero film. He manages to return as a director in his own unique way. He knows how to bring this film back into focus and sometimes in similar ways to capture scenes as he has done in previous films. Fans can enjoy and recognize some more of these references and hints to his old movies. Surprisingly, Sam Raimi also provides an introduction to the horror genre in the Marvel film series. This film uses elements that can be more exciting or even scary for young children. While horror elements aren't too scary, kids under 12 shouldn't watch this movie alone without a parent with them. In addition to the horror elements, the film also uses sequences with prolonged flashing lighting effects, which may be sensitive to people with photosensitive epilepsy. Sam Raimi, together with the photography director and editors, also ensure that the visual effects come across well and believable. In this way they know how to convey the transition between different universes in a beautiful way. Sometimes you can see with some creatures that they have been placed in the film with CGI, but fortunately this does not disturb while watching. To better understand the story, it is useful if you have seen previous Marvel films and series, especially their Disney+ series WandaVision. Fortunately, the film itself explains other references to previous films or series enough so that you can continue to follow what is happening or what it is about. Furthermore, the film has a gripping story that you as a viewer quickly get involved in. The film script was written solely by Michel Waldron, for whom this is only his first film script. Before this, he has written more scripts for TV series, even for the Marvel Disney+ series Loki. Still, the script is sometimes a bit on the weak side and problems are solved too quickly or too simply. A director like Sam Raimi deserved to work with a better screenwriter. Sam Raimi and Marvel producer Kevin Feige could have looked at this a little better, because then they could have had a better movie. Around the film, just like the previous Marvel film Spider-Man: No Way Home, there were many ideas and theories about what could emerge in this film. For a more entertaining experience, you should not go to this film with too high expectations, because that can lead to disappointment in some cases. In this film Sam Raimi also works together with music composer Danny Elfman, who again manages to provide a good and appropriate soundtrack. The acting is also well done by the film cast. After the events of the preceding Marvel films, Benedict Cumberbatch still manages to portray the character of Doctor Strange in an appropriate and somewhat sarcastic way. Yet in this film he is also a bit more inquisitive and insecure with the new universes that he also visits for the first time. Elizabeth Olsen also gets the chance to portray her character on a more dramatic side in this film after everything her character has been through in the previous films. The rest of the cast doesn't get many opportunities to do much with their characters because of the lesser script. The celebrities are doing just as good a job as in their previous Marvel films and the film also has a few entertaining cameos."
"A visually arresting, eerily poignant tale of multiversal proportions!","Marvel has well and truly embraced the realm of psychological turmoil and mind-bending narratives, first by conjuring up the infinite possibilities of the multiverse in ""Spiderman: No Way Home (2021)"" and then following that up with the nerve-rackingly psychedelic ""Moon Knight"" series. The Master of the Mystic Arts faces the repercussion of his multiverse-opening antics in this eerily engaging visual extravaganza, with a decadent amount of surprise guest appearances and a poignant storyline that will closely resonate with fans of the MCU.

Veteran auteur Sam Raimi returns to the director's chair in ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" after having spearheaded the rise of the genre with his groundbreaking ""Spider-Man"" trilogy (2002-07) starring Tobey Maguire. The aesthetically arresting style of the director combined with two ace performers in Oscar-nominee Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen deliver a riveting saga of coping with loss and the universe-altering ends one will go to to repair a broken heart.

We join Doctor Strange after the events of No Way Home, having encountered a mysterious traveller ""America Chavez"" (an excellent Xochitl Gomez) who reached our version of Earth after being chased across multiverses by a mysterious unknown entity. Strange, alongside the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong (Benedict Wong) embark on a journey across the known and unknown universe and across the legends of sorcery and witchcraft to get to the truth, recruiting a morose ""Scarlett Witch"" (Olsen), still reeling after her tumultuous sojourn in the Disney+ series, ""Wanda Vision"".

Cumberbatch is a revelation as Dr. Strange, portraying the angst and confusion of a man who returned after getting 5 years of his life erased away by Thanos' snap, with elan. He finds that the world has moved on in his absence, especially his former lady-love, Christine (Rachel McAdams) and we get to see the human side of the world's most powerful sorcerer while he comes to grips with his predicaments. As Dr. Strange embarks on a perilous adventure across multiverses, we get to see the immense range of Cumberbatch in full flow, with the nuances and intricacies he brings to each version of the master sorcerer in the different worlds we visit, a joy to behold.

Elizabeth Olsen continues the fine form she displayed in ""Wanda Vision"", delivering a perfectly balanced performance that is equal parts poignant and powerful. Oscar-nominee Chiewetel Ejiofor returns as Dr. Strange's bête noire, ""Mordo"", in a short but impactful cameo. Without giving much away, let me just say that the dizzying array of other surprise cameos not only provide several whistle-worthy moments in the theatre but also gel in well with the narrative structure.

Doctor Strange's second stand-alone movie is a fitting addition to Marvel's darker, murkier Phase 4 where we get to explore the inner psyche of our heroes at a deeper level and is more reliant on its performances than on being spectacle-driven. That being said, the CGI and visual effects are nothing short of mesmerizing as we journey along with our heroes across multiverses, with the storyline opening up an infinite array of potential spin-offs and future tie-ins featuring our favourite heroes from franchises long past as well as promising new ones down the line. A must-watch in theatres. Highly recommended! And do watch out for one mid-credits scene as well as an end-credits one."
Meh,"Tried to fill to many boxes and got nothing out of it. The script was terrible, the vfx were lousy and not cared at all, the ""horror twist"" it wanted failed miserably. Giving it 4 because Benedict and Elizabeth managed to still be good at acting even with all the non-sense."
The corpse of marvel,"This film features a zombified version of Stephen Strange. In a way, this is representative of the trajectory of marvel films. They used to be vibrant and impressive, but now the studio is so desperate to keep the whole thing going that it feels almost farcical. Everything post-Endgame (with the exception of Spidey) feels lifeless, even when satisfactory. Maybe, just maybe, Kevin Feige and the rest of the marvel crew will work some sort of magic and breathe life into the ailing universe again. However, if this film is any indication, they haven't quite figured that spell out yet."
One of the worst movies i have ever seen,This movie is a huge insult to your intelligence. Like every other marvel movie it is predictable and stupid. I wouldn't even recommend it for a 5 years old kid. This is not cinema this is a way to make money out of cheap costumes.
"Comical, but in the wrong way",One of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. The whole movie is a bad acid trip. Nothing makes any sense. The only difference is there's no chance of a relapse 30 years later.
It's Bad,"So convoluted it's boring. Three stars for CGI. Latina character ribs Strange for not speaking Spanish, but the actress's own Spanish sounds poor. The writing was terrible."
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is undoubtedly one of the most unique installments in the MCU. But...,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)

""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is undoubtedly one of the most unique installments in the MCU, thanks to Sam Raimi's distinctive visual style and his impressive ability to elude the Marvel formula by seriously venturing into the horror elements. Never has a film from the cinematic universe been so violent, bloody, and terrifying.

Benedict Cumberbatch and especially Elizabeth Olsen carry the complex story about the multiverse through Michael Waldron's flawed screenplay. The balance between the various storylines could be better, America Chavez is just one MacGuffin to reach another MacGuffin, and the journey through the multiple universes only compensates for the mind-blowing visual effects.

Some personal disappointment is associated with the cameos treatment and the lack of real-location filming. Overall, more was expected from what was supposed to be Phase Four's ""big movie"", but it's a solid entry into the top half of the franchise.""

Rating: B."
"Stupid, useless & ugly","This may be the most stupid, useless and ugly movie I have ever seen. I was invited to to see this in a theater and even with the 3D glasses I fell asleep 3 times. Why? Because bombastic all the time makes a movie super boring. You may add 3D or even 6D glasses, but it wont change a thing. The story is stupid (no a motherless mother is not deep) its hyper ugly (as only Americans can make) its totally boring, showing the same stupid action over en over. A totally wast of time. Nice when you are young and like the world as a computer game."
Another miss in the new MCU,
Inconsistent,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is one film that's difficult to summarize my experience, because at some times it's the best film in the MCU and at another it's among the least.

The CGI is the most culprit, it feels grossly unpolished in some scenes and at the next it's breath taking.

The horror themes that was injected by director Sam Raimi helps to provide some level of uniqueness but occasionally suffers from the clichés of the genre

Marvel definitely wanted to try a different ingredient to their working formula and i'm here for it."
Tripleverse,"First of all I really enjoyed it and it felt different from most marvel movies and the horror elements were FANTASTIC but .... The ending, I was not to gone on the ending, I feel with what everyone had to go through to get there, it kind of fell a little flat Secondly there were a few moments where the CG wasn't fantastic but that's not to bad, lastly the decisions of some people, arguing for no reason JUST LISTEN TO STRANGE Also not a lot of multiverse, I would have liked more in that aspect

On the plus side, it looked great, it sounded amazing, the horror take was my favourite part of the movie, strange I feel never really was mad into action but the spells in this one were really cool.

The rami touch to this was fantastic!!!

I feel like with knowledge of Wandavision you could almost say this was a lone adventure, there was no feeling that it's leading into another movie like most marvel movies do and I think that's a good thing. I would definitely watch this one again, I loved the characters, the acting was great, overall a great marvel and rami movie !!"
great movie,"I think fans expectations for cameos were high after no way home, but i enjoyed the movie greatly.

Camera work was outstanding, CGI was exceptional, fight scenes had me on the edge of my seat.

The character development of both wanda and strange was perfect for future appearances, we got to look slightly into stranges past and also see wandas ideal life.

The fight scene between wanda and the illuminati had me MINDBLOWN, pun intended. The movie shows how much power that wong, chavez, wanda and strange have. The ending leaving many questions.

2 end credit scenes and the 2nd one actually means so much more than many people think, marvel broke the 4th wall and this makes future projects potentially even better."
Feels like,This feels more like a money grab that a well thought out movie and I wish they would stop making these Doctor Strange movies. At best Doctor Strange is a minor character in avengers movie.
Low ratings for lack of cameos,
The M-SHE-U Strikes Again *sigh*,
I fell asleep,"I fell asleep about halfway through. I'm giving it a 2/10 because I have really bad insomnia and I've tried all kinds of medication, but nothing works. Looks like I just have to watch this movie every night once it's available for purchase. Thanks Disney."
Scarlet Witch and the Multiverse of Strangeness,"It's a sequel movie to WandaVision so, if you've missed it then you better go watch that right now else everything in the movie will not make any sense.

But, but, even if you did watch, it's a complete mess -- a multiverse of messiness. Weak storylines, forced witty dialogues + acting is a deal breaker for this now-over-hyped movie.

It is a supernatural flick that tries to get a little scary with its horror elements but end up being an unintentional comedy flick."
One of the MCU's best.,"The script and overall storyline could use some improvement to make it better than it was. However, with its breakneck pace, the film is still able to give room for its characters to breathe, which is a great benefit to its narrative. The film really shines when Sam Raimi goes on full Sam Raimi. Elisabeth Olsen clearly is the MVP."
Into Absolute Madness,Multiverse of madness proves itself to be a remarkable movie...with high grade visual effects and high visualization from director Sam Rami. Rami puts the audience on the edge of their seats...with a few jumps here and there. What makes it even better is the well written story from old prehistoric history and mythology into a comic book movie adaption.... Hope Sam Rami signs up for more marvel movies like this.
Another bait and switch by Marvel,
I'm So Disappointed,"This movie is the definition of disappointment, it's the most ridiculous and stupidest Marvel movie I've ever seen. I want my money back. It's more like a bad horror movie."
The most helpless main character you have ever seen.,
A fun cinema experience,"Wow this was a lot of fun, maybe not the best film I've ever seen but it was one of the best cinema experiences I've had in a good while. Go see the film it's good fun."
Awful. What was this horror movie mess?,So disappointing. Felt creepy and horror movie like. Not at all Marvel. Stick to your genre Marvel!!!! I hated this movie. I've never left a review. Putting characters from other movies in it couldn't save this muddy make of a script. Who signed off on this? Dont bring your young children. Gave me nightmares. Dark and twisted. Yuk yuk yuk.
Truly terrible,One of the worst marvel movies made. Not fun. Poor character development. Poor script. Truly terrible. Do not waste your time. First movie was great but this is a huge disappointment.
Raimi's Marvel Horror Masterpiece,"I don't know what people expected from this movie, I've read such dumb criticisms. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Wong and Strange have always had a great dynamic, they have great dialog.

Wanda is both the villian and hero in this story. It's not ""the same story as Wandavision."" Elizabeth Olsen shines in every scene, I absolutely adored her portrayal, and felt the emotion in every one of her scenes.

It's a story of love, loss, growth, and hope.

It's shorter than most Marvel movies, but I thought it was a good thing. Kept the story moving.

Some great cameos and teases of future characters.

Raimi obviously was having a lot of fun. Plenty of rolling camera shots and visually fun like. I thought the CGI was the best I've seen in marvel so far, not clunky and hard to follow."
So Bad It's Good,"Every decision is wrong. This film is probably the first so bad it's good movie in the marvel franchise. None of the characters have any charm or chemistry with each other, most of the dialogue is dull, and the movie just flings a bunch of things into your face. The tone of the movie is also very sporadic. As long as you don't take it seriously, you could probably enjoy the film.

But every decision is bad. The powers of each character are used in boring or non-sensical ways, and the characters introduced are seemingly made just for the surprise factor, as if there's nothing past that. And the power level of each character is so obviously wrong (way more than even Avengers: Endgame). Even the characters central to the story have motivations which don't make sense.

More than anything though, the reaction shots in this movie are incredible, and there are a lot of them. Also, in each scene, there are themes of different types of camera movements, and that also adds to the comedic element of the film. Noticing how bad the movie is on each level makes it even funnier. The raw strength of the cast adds to the comedy.

As an aside, paying attention to how the camera moves was funny for me. There's one scene in particular, where the camera pushed in on characters at least 5 times in a minute. Golden.

Also, despite spending 200 million in the budget, some of the CGI in this movie just looks bad. Especially when it intersects with real people, it really just looks terrible (when the shot is just CGI it looks fine though).

In summation, the directing is boring and obvious, the ideas are stale, the budget is huge (lots of well-known actors), the dialogue is comical (hopefully), and the characters' decisions make no sense. But if you're ready for that experience, you'll enjoy the movie."
Should be called Doctor Strange: into the madness,"The most BIZZARE MCU film ever made

Movie was fun, had Sam raimi written all over it, I feel like they gave him a lot of creative control on this film as well. I am appreciative to see Sam back in the game, I will say however this film I didn't love as much as I wanted to. Sometimes I would just feel the run time, and how the plot/story felt drawn out more than it should. There is nice action, but it can be a tad repetitive at times, nonetheless it's a joy ride. The villain is amazing and id say Carries the film in ways. There isn't as much multiverse meddling that the movie kind of claims it has in its title, sure they visit like 1 or 2 multiverse worlds but I feel like it's more madness going on in this film. Doctor strange was great and so was Wanda,

Pros:

Sam raimi creative control

Very bonkers moments that really feel crazy that the MCU even allowed raimi to do in the film and it is very appreciated whole heartedly!

Wanda Maximoff !!!

Doctor Strange story dynamic

Actors were pretty great,

Cons:

Plot/story couldn't care for or get behind much, once I kind of saw how it was shaping to be and the direction it was going I just couldn't care for it as much

My reason for this I believe has to do with this I believe has to do with America Chavez I literally tried to feel some sort of attachment to her character but there's like nothing... she's basically the sole reason for the film, and there's like one scene she has with strange when they're standing on some platform that shows their memories... that's like the only moment I kind of latched onto her but it wasn't enough, sure they sprinkled more stuff into it but her performance, dialogue and purpose wasn't enough bread and butter to me compared to everyone else and I think is another reason why I couldn't get into the story/plot as much

Tone seems fine but I feel like the film would have been better off being an R rated film, not a huge con and I think raimi balances it well, but I feel maybe this is another reason why I felt a little distant to the direction

There's a part in the film where scarlet witch does something in like 1,2,3 to a bunch of people who should have stopped her... but of course they didn't... which is fine... I don't have a problem with that, if she's really that powerful to take down (these people who will not be named) then I'll buy that... BUT when it comes to her doing what has to be done for the plot/story of the film... it feels as if the movie is just stalling that time for the sake of the Plot/story... like didn't you just do ABC??? Why can't you do XYZ??? Just doesn't make sense to me, then of course it builds enough time for the film to catch up to her when she clearly has the advantage and clearly is not holding back anymore.

P. S

I really do appreciate this film for the sole purpose that I feel the MCU really gave this creative control the Raimi and it had his name written all over it. You can tell it's his film from every shot... sure it felt maybe a tad scattered here and there but the moments that are supposed to deliver kind of do, even if it doesn't necessarily stick the landing, there are ALOT of moments in the film that will have your brain go ""the MCU allowed raimi to do this in the film??!!!!"" And when you see it you kind of just smile really hard especially when you know this guys film style. I really did appreciate the shots and spectacle he delivered

In the 6.5 of Madness/10."
CGI abusing talented actors,"I guess the plan was to make a chaotic script to hide the lack of ideas. The whole movie was a waste of talent taken place while Wanda, again, gets confused by her own powers. There are so many CGI effects that some scene seem like a video game. Wanda looks like she can be the most powerful superhero or villain in a very crowded MCU."
Down down down..,"What an utterly disappointing sequel. The death of Doctor Strange (and Marvel) at the hands of sub-par writing, producing and sadly, acting.

All good things must come to an end, and that is what has happened to Doctor Strange. Yet another two hours of my life wasted on a CGI garbage filled movie."
too many plot holes...,"Dr. Strange in a cuckoo script, in a bad way.

All super-hero movies have their problems with reality as expected. That's one thing and nobody cares. However plot holes and unnecessary scenes.

A literal childish motive moves the plot.

The main villain (see, no spoilers here) uses his/her powers only when it serves the plot (ripping it apart).

Someone here wrote that propably ""somewere in the multiverse there's a better version of this movie"". I sincerly doubt it."
MCU is just getting farther and farther off the tracks,"Seems like the MCU is just steadily getting farther into extreme fantasy and storylines that are so far from the ""superhero"" genre and much more into the ""fairy tale"" genre. I did not find this film engaging and there was no significant character development in one of the main characters (America) at all. The ""Illuminati"" was a combination of a toss-off of ""What if"" storylines, a gag, and a chance for cameos. This strikes me as Disney & the Marvel taking their audience for granted."
Memory lane for hardcore Marvel fans,"You are going to need to be up with all the relevant Marvel spin-offs and at that, be a true Marveller to completely appreciate this film's journey. But you can intelligently add bits together to get a sense of story plot and where the other heroes fit into the multiverse from across the decades. It is a good movie which is best appreciated on the big screen."
MCU Mother's Day Gift,"I will keep this brief.

Marvel must have timed this to be a Mother's Day gift. All about what a Mother would be willing to do to reunite with her kids.

There are plenty of other messages wrapped in the movie which I enjoyed seeing but not being a fan of the Marvel Universe I will stop any further comments, other than to say it must have really been a challenge for the actors to have to act in such a heavy CGI focused movie."
I went and saw the doctor today,"Today, my sisters and our brother and I went to see doctor strange and it was awesome I was not expecting a thing and was surprised every time. And Wanda, that poor girl, she was hurting and feel so bad for her. Can't wait to see what happens next with them."
"Yeesh, This One Is a Stinker","MCU aside, Benedict Cumberbatch has a pretty illustrious career acting in some high caliber films. This isn't one of them. No one brought their A-game in this movie. Not even Cumberbatch. The girl (Xochitl Gomez) has terrible delivery and even Elizabeth Olson's acting is a bit wonky at times.

The pace of the movie is terrible as well. You feel like you're riding in a car with a new driver who keeps slamming the break and flooring the accelerator repeatedly. Fast pace action, fast pace action, wedding scene fast paced action, random slow-paced conversation along with a random memory machine that conveniently provides backstory for both characters, fast pace action...you get the point.

Maybe it's expecting too much for a movie about the multiverse to have less CGI, but this movie is just one giant CGI mess."
"I'm not even bothering to explain, Marvel..",Expected much more from the trailer. The horror label isn't worthy at all and many absurd situations and useless conversations and awkward silences as usual. What I did liked that they rewarded the fans once again with the fan favorite cast. Well done! DC&WB take notes!
"Too much, yet to little.","Raimi's directing clashes with Marvel's vision to the point where it tries to do too much but ends up doing nothing. Elizabeth Olsen's preformance is great, but other than that the dialogue feels forced all the time. America Chavez as a caracter is impossible to like, care or emphatize with. The plot tries too hard to not be predictable to the point where it leads right back where you thought it was going to go. The few minutes of expected MCU fan service are absolutely redundant to the plot as it helps establish how powerful wanda is, which is already shown beforehand. It does have some impressive visuals, and the music is brilliant, but overall one of the worst experiences I've had in a theater in a while. To be fair, the expectations was very high."
Don't waste your precious time - Disappointed,"The start of the movie is really slow. But then all of a sudden, everyone decides to run faster than Sonic.

In the first half of the movie, there will be a lot of plot holes (A LOT).

We are introduced to a character that fills all the requirements to be an interesting and important piece of the story: -Power comes from ""believing""; -Lesbian parents; -Mixed race.

This was not a Doctor Strange Movie.

They tried to force a little bit of horror, which has somewhat mediocre (you don't need to watch a lot of horror movies to know that jump scares don't make a character ""scary"").

They added a little more gore which was cool IMO.

Disappointed, I don't recommend it."
"I wanted to like it because the action scenes and visuals were cool, but it had too many stories.",
A boring mess,"The movie is all over the place, CGI was there but nothing special. The plot was weak and the characters are shallow.

Wouldn't recommend paying for cinema screening."
"whew , it's finally over","I watched this with my son, he' an adult , I was really really glad when it was over , it was complete madness previous ones were not to bad, maybe it's me , but it seemed like they were making stuff up as they went along.

Finally i'm getting really tired of all this Marvel , rehashed garbage ............focus on real stories from now on t."
Best film of this phase,"Believe me believe me , I did not expect the director of Spider-Man 2002 to make such a great movie. The movie was well made. No crowded game. Its focuses on less fictional characters but better than other films of this phase. Excellent. The film has a melasmic beginning and becomes quite surreal.

A movie that is not captured by game technology, or just a movie made and sold. When we say that everything in Hollywood is on the books, we mean this. Not that everything is a project work mode and build and sell. Rather, it is the fact that when they make a movie on account and book, everyone does their job correctly. The result is a masterpiece like this. But if you were to make a movie and sell it, no matter how strong it was made, it would not have the main effect and the main work of the cinema medium. The movie is one of Marvel's best works."
Terrifying!,"I love Doctor Strange. But this movie is for Wanda. She carried the whole film in her back. The Wanda scenes were both amazing & terrifying. Also, they fortunately did less jokes than their previous films. And this movie is definitely not PG-13. Also, both the post credit & the end credit scene is important."
The first one was better,"It felt like the whole movie was making the multiple Dr Stranges into the villain. In the first one he was almost invincible and went toe to toe with Thanos. This whole movie he was weak, needing help, getting advice, and did not give off main character vibes. Hard pass on this one. I have no idea how the rating can be so close to the first one."
Chaotic Madness! I Loved it!,"Doctor Strange, the multiverse of madness sure does live up to not only its name but the hype as well. I went to my local theatre and I was not disappointed, while there are many voicing there opinions but if you haven't watched Wandavision prior to this then you probably won't understand alot of plot and references. I absolutely loved this film, this has got to be one of Marvels best movies to date.

It was great seeing the illuminati finally be bought into the MCU, we all have to understand that this is another reality, we could see these people again which is mindblowing! The acting, the visuals, everything about this was incredible.

Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Sir Patrick Stewart, and many more really stood out in these roles, I was absolutely gobsmacked at who appeared in the film, I don't want to ruin anything so I wont mention who else appeared but you will absolutely love it.

I highly recommend this movie, suck on that Scorsese!

Remember to catch Wandavision first."
"Great Movie, Wrong Title.","This was a great movie. But it has a completly wrong title. This should have been called: ""Scarlet Witch"". This movie had some great aspects and elements. Genuenly a great movie. 100x times better than Morbius."
Horror Action,
In Marvel We Trust,
Visually Stunning but Bonkers story,
awesome,"What I like most about this movie? Is to have a Super HEro turning to the ""Dark"" powers.

I disagree with other reviews that this movie is a ""horror"" movie, it is not the kind of bright and everything happy hero movies. Definitely nothing for childs. But definitely not the kind of scary movies."
Good but... I have a worry,"Maybe i'm totally dumb but like, what are they going to do to keep this whole multiverse thing fresh? This movie is a good addition to the MCU but I really dont think it was stellar,maybe it's cause I just watched it but yeah good but not great. What are they going to do with the multiverse idea though in the upcoming films?"
Well it certainly feels like a Sam Raimi movie,"I enjoyed the first Doctor Strange film even though it followed the same format of superhero origin stories. The exploration of the magic side was just an interesting aspect of the universe and I just love how they portrayed it visually. So I was gutted when the director of the original, Scott Derrickson, left the project. However, it was then revealed that legendary director Sam Raimi, director of the Evil Dead and Spider-Man trilogy, would direct it and I was super excited again. So does it deliver a multiverse of fun or is it a multiverse of dullness?

Firstly, this is definitely a Sam Raimi movie. All the usual flairs that you would expect from him are completely in here and I love it. The stylistic way he shoots a scene, the way he portrays New York feels like what he did in Spider-Man, the slight goofiness, the horror elements and jump scares are all here. There are some great visuals during the magic sequence and multiverse stuff. There are also some horrific scenes that genuinely surprised me as it felt too gruesome for a PG 13 movie. It's a Sam Raimi film through and through and his direction elevates this movie to new heights.

There are also some great action set pieces that were very creative and a blast to watch. The music is composed by Danny Elfman and he does a great job. There is a fun action sequence with the use of music and Danny does a great job with the music score to illustrate that battle. The actors are also all doing a great job. Benedict Cumberbatch is still the perfect Doctor Strange and delivers on every scene. I also love how he portrays the other Doctor Strange variants from other universes. Benedict Wong is great and his chemistry with the other Benedict is still fun to watch. Rachel McAdams returns as Christine but unlike the first film she has more to do this time and I appreciate that since she is wonderful in the role. Xochitl Gomez is good as America Chavez and I like her interaction with Doctor Strange. The other supporting cast does a good job as well even with their small screen time. The biggest standout is Elisabeth Olsen as Wanda. She does a phenomenal job in her performance. I just love how she did in every scene from the emotional to the scary. She is the core of this film.

However, that is also part of the reason I didn't enjoy the story as much. For a movie titled Doctor Strange, he isn't even the complete focus of the plot as he shares equal screen time with Wanda as well as having to share it with America Chavez as well. All 3 of them have story arcs but none are done to a satisfying degree. Strange still loves Christine, Wanda still loves her children, and Chavez doesn't trust Strange and this is their character for almost the whole of the movie. They all lack proper characterization and depth which makes them all feel one dimensional. Chavez ends up feeling like a MacGuffin for the plot and a person to spout exposition, rather than an interesting foil to Strange or Wanda. There is also a pacing drop around the second act where it is just a lot of walking and talking which went on for a bit too long. Ended up making the movie feel longer than it is. The ending is also great and very Sam Raimi but the mid-credit scene just undoes any impact of the ending and that is such a shame.

Overall, I am thrilled by the return of Sam Raimi to the superhero genre. While the screenplay lets the movie down a bit, Sam Raimi was still able to make this movie feel unique. It's clear that the MCU didn't restrain Sam's wackiness and I am glad about that. Thanks to his amazing direction and the terrific performance from the cast, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ends up being extremely fun to watch."
Sorry but it's getting old and Sam Raimi is losing his MAGIC!! Please return to your roots!!,"What I mean WAY to much CGI and this is coming from a person who ALWAYS defends CGI but I miss good old GREAT practical effects. I go back and watch my favorite films from my favorite directors and with most they were better when they had to be creative and had no budget. Evil dead when it came out was NOT funny like so many people say now I used to show the hbo vhs copy I had and I'd say 70 percent couldn't make it through the movie because it scared them so much or it Amazed the horror fan like myself and If I hear 1 more IGNORANT horror wanna be reviewer say that part 2 is better I'm going to scream bloody murder!! The original evil dead is the best horror film ever the creative filming the PHENOMENAL story the perfect casting especially Bruce Campbell as ash Evil dead and john carpenter's the thing when I saw them in the theater which was hard cause they were hard to find they BLEW ME AWAY this doctor strange had VERY LITTLE of sam raimi it had a few tiny hints but not since drag me to hell and dark man have I seen the REAL SAM!! Its a shame as I still think he has more to show. He made it so he doesn't have to work anymore so the creative process is gone. Want perfection watch: dead alive, the thing from 1982, in the mouth of madness, the serpent and the rainbow, dog soldiers, dead snow part 1 and 2 and WER."
Phenomenal visuals but flawed plot,"After a rough two years following the pandemic in which the MCU had almost only misses, Dr. Strange 2 is one of the few exceptions. It's not one of the strongest, but its entertainment value is there. This is true mostly thanks to Sam Raimi who gave an excellent performance behind the camera and of the creative team. The visuals, the various worlds, the imaginary and the camera movements are all inspired and the final segment is a total madness such that I think some scenes will become iconic. On the other side however, the plot is very weak. At least there is an overall sense and so the great visuals are not wasted, but if we look closer a lot of problem come to the surface. Also the whole premise of the movie, the villan and its motivations are kind of a nonsense because they could have been solved right at the start of the movie. And so if I have to do an average I'd say that Dr. Strange 2 is an ok movie, that is able to entertain for all of its duration and that is a fresh new entry for the MCU with a particular style, but the issues of the plot prevent it to go from a fun watch to an incredible experience. And with those visuals is really a pity."
A woke mess,Writer listen up. Focus on a story. Leave social issues out of the scripts. It's distracting and obvious. Kind of reminds me of product placements. Except this is even more pathetically obvious.
"What about the cringe ""musical notes"" thing?",
"7 is me being generous, really I'd give it a 5",
Misleading Marketing,The synopsis of the film has nothing to do with the film For a multiverse film there is not enough multiverse there Also the most important/ surprised cameo is spoiled at the trailer and also it had no impact at the film (just like the other cameos)
No Plot and No Significant Characters,"Pros: -Good visual effects and atmospheres -Good cast -Good use of horror

Cons: -Terrible and incomprehensible plot -Useless side and main characters -Poor character development -I think the biggest hinderance to this movie is that is relies on the viewer to have watched a B their spin-off TV show to even get slighted invested into Wanda, otherwise the movie is just boring. This is one of the only movies I had seriously felt the urge to walk out of. Worst plot line and structure I have ever witnessed. They attempted to make it ""madness"" and wacky but it did not work for me in this case."
What a wonderful Raimi,"A truly spectacular phenomenon, an adventure to mend time, and occasionally space. A beautiful feature by the ever wonderful Raimi, executed wonderfully, sparing no expense."
Visually beautiful. Sam Raimi's mind is amazing.,"Personally thought Multiverse of Madness was awesome! Sam Raimi has a magnificent mind & this film starts off fast paced & doesn't slow down at all. Both Benedict's with amazing performances & Elizabeth Olsen is incredible. Xochitl Gomez nails it & is going to be a star for a long time. Some nice cameos throughout. 2 credit scenes, though the last one isn't that important but worth sticking around for if you're a Raimi fan!"
Another Marvel POS,"Why do People keep going to see these? Everyone is the same, why not mix it up and get creative with these super hero movies.

Not much else to say except dhehsjdb dons. Ann's dmdkkdnndnndnndnb bend."
A refreshing change of filming style from a conventional marvel movie.,"I don't get it why people are finding this movie bad. Go in without expectations or stupidly believing too much on rumours and I can vouch you will be pleasantly surprised. The movie should've been longer and could've benefitted from a deeper storyline, but the performances of Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen do shine out. The CGI and direction of the movie was amazing and honestly I would say if possible go watch in IMAX because that's how it'll do justice for the amazing visuals and effects the movie had to provide. People saying that it had become messy and stuff. I don't know why they said that, but if you apply your mind, you will understand all of it without any issue. They probably don't have the mental capacity to fathom 2-3 storyline's running at one, and cohere them into one plot. It takes some brain and patience to watch the movie and understand it and oh boy it rewards with its amazing visuals.

In conclusion: Don't go in with expectations of all sorts of cameos and rumours

Pay attention Watch in IMAX (preferably) Use your brains And enjoy the movie

I would probably rate this half a point higher than No way home just to give credit to the fact that it does not blow up trying to juggle too many characters like all the three spideys making it a bad mess out of the hype. It is a worthy watch.

Also one last point, I feel seeing this movie on TV would not even give 1/4th of the experience it gives in the theatres just because of the extravagant CGI used which would just good in a good 3D hall."
Not at all enjoyable,
Don't believe the negative reviews,"WOW. Are people picky now a days.. I'm not sure why this is getting negative reviews. Haters gonna hate I guess. I loved this movie. It has great visuals, outstanding acting and a great horror side to it (thank you Sami). Please go watch this and judge for yourself."
What the Hell was this?!,
Such a BIG story to tell so why so short?,"In every way shape and form this is a stunning spectacle of a film with characters coming at you from every direction through the whole film.

Unlike a few of the recent MCU films this is one of the major figures running the show here so no need for to many explanations to what's going on BUT my one big fault for this film is with such a massive story to tell why try and cram it in to such a short run time ?

It could in all possibility be put in 2 chapters/2 films The massive scene that the trailers have been teasing could of been in my view much longer With such great cameos why cut them short.like this??

Even with its fault this new ""darker"" avenue really fits this whole franchise."
Visual treat,"Absolutely loved it,especially horror elements made the film much better,it was a visual treat u have to watch this film only in theatres as it gives best experience,Elizabeth olsen acting is phenomenal. Sam raimi direction was too good ,Benedict and other actors did great job but cameos could have been better. My final verdict is excellent movie u need watch this movie only in theatrew for best experience."
Just not the old marvel :(,It feels like they are trying hard to forge the new marvel universe watching the last marvel movies. Original marvel ended after the Avenger end game.
Really Strange and Mad,"Well , it for sure includes the defaults of a Marvel movie like saving the world etc but the storyline was cleverly adjusted so you never get loss traction. And visuals are the best I've seen so far so deserves 8 stars. Also the density of jokes were in the exact right amount so very entertaining movie. I watched it in 4dx and it was too shaky due to action scenes."
"Good, not great","This is a very enjoyable film that finally brings Stephen Strange front and center. Ever since Infinity war I've wanted to see more of him and this movie doesn't disappoint on that front. It is however, very important to keep your expectations in check. This movie is NOT a cameo fest, it's mainly focused on Strange and Wanda with Wong and Chavez playing an important part in the story as well. The pacing of this movie isn't great, it moves too quickly and could've benefitted from a longer runtime. I also think the ''multiverse'' aspect is really minimal. The multiverse is barely explored and I can't help but feel that many opportunities have been missed. Everything we do get to see on screen though is exciting and thrilling, this movie has quite some horror and gory aspects to it which I enjoyed but they might not be for everyone. This movie has a slim story, pacing that is too rapid but exciting moments and characters you can't get enough of. Strange embarks on a thrilling journey in this film but this movie is definitely not one of the MCU greatest, which is totally okay. If you're a casual fan I'd highly recommend watching WandaVision before watching this film. Enjoy:)"
Not good.,"I was looking forward to this movie, and the expectations were quite high from Spiderman. But what I watched was far from i imagined the movie to be.

""Strange"" is probably the only word that stuck. Strange character decisions, strange storyline, a cringe-worthy script, and did Disney also adopt the gore from ""The Boys"" series?! I was left very unfulfilled after this movie, and I'll just pretend it doesn't exist. You guys should have spent more time thinking about the story, and less time trying to tick all the boxes of extras you've cast."
UMMM... IM SPEECHLESS,"This has been one of my most anticipated films since the first Doctor Strange released... and it delivered!!!!

There is so much i wanna say but can't.

All i have to say is brush up on your Wandavision knowledge before watching and enjoy this ""thriller"" ride of a movie!!!!"
Kinda creepy and kinda cool,
Lost in the Multiverse,"The opportunity to do something incredible got scattered and lost throughout the multiverse and ended in disappointment.

The plot is subpar with a premise that is borderline ridiculous, there is no tension or stakes that matter, no depth like the first one and Dr. Strange magic is starting to look like a cheap clone of Green Lantern.

Some argue that this movie has a pinch of ""horror"", but if it is there I didn't see it. It's all too campy with some terrible dialogs, cheesy photography work/grading and terrible music that reminds of B movies from the 80's.

I'm starting to think that the Multiverse is a can of worms that should have been kept closed."
Could have been better,
Waste of potential..,"Marvel movies were once the standard for great stories, well developed characters and story lines over decades that kept combining, linking and growing.. sadly Disney dropped that. This movie is much more bland to the point where Wanda could have been a random baddy and America (why ffs?) is little better. It's an ok movie, but not worthy of the Avengers legacy.."
Too Much spoiler before Movie release,"Action was good can be better more.

They can't express that level feeling it just normal movie.

And last moment fight of the movie was like funny ,not like real suspence action."
Sam Raimi ruined this movie,"Sam Raimi all over the place, feels like a cheap horror and full of asinine comedy typical of Raimi, totally out of place and inadequate for a MCU movie. I feel like I've been robbed of a great Dr. Strange sequel, totally a missed opportunity. **** you Raimi."
Another Marvel,"In so many ways this is what you'd expect. Nonstop action and appearances from as many Marvel heroes as possible. The surprise might have been twofold. 1) Different faces than you might expect on a couple of them; and 2) the inclusion of characters from other Marvel franchises. The latter is not so much of a surprise and the former is clever.

There is not much I can add to over 2.5K other reviews, so I will throw in a couple of random thoughts I had.

During one of the transfer scenes my mind conjured the thought that this would fit into a Sixties LSD trip quite easily. Almost on top of that, my mind wondered if the director told the special effects artists to create a bunch of fantastical scenes at random and then they would figure how to fit them into the story. These were random impressions and not meant as realistic criticisms plus or minus.

Another more concrete thought revolved around the use of multiverses. Endgame used time travel to throw all the normal rules out the window. Some great character once said ""I hate time travel"" or something similar. Multiverses is another way to throw all the rules out the window. That and giving the villain almost unlimited power with no cost or consequences to its use. Marvel seems to excel at this last point."
Dark,"I liked the movie, but of course there were some disappointments. There are so many theories and it's pissing me off now. Sam Raimi added differences to the movie. Many death scenes were too harsh for a Marvel movie. The music wasn't bad either. Overall I enjoyed the movie. Of course, there were parts that I liked and parts that I did not like. I think this is the darkiest Marvel movie."
It certainly couldn't have been worse.,"Bizarre scenes, inclusion of meaningless characters, bad acting, horrible story, disappointment in its entirety, I don't know how the evolution of a film of this caliber could have been so lost. Scenes that you will surely see in better quality on YouTube by fans."
Should have stuck to the same formula,"A certain formula has made Marvel films enjoyable and set it apart from its competitors. Doctor Strange mistakenly departs from this tried and true strategy and gives a rather mixed and dark sort of film. After seeing the potential and creativity in the multiverse concept with Spiderman I had high expectations for Doctor Strange. Sadly I saw a dull, slow and average film.

It also proves that some characters might be better supporting heroes instead of leads. Doctor Strange is great when he is part of a team and entertains us for his parts in the film but on his own he leaves a lot to be desired. I found the first Doctor Strange film a bit lackluster as well but it was still better than its sequel. This should have not left the drawing board team."
Great but I'm not impressed,"I like that marvel took a darker route to doctor strange, guess it was to be expected once they got a horror movie director to it. It still has a few laughs and visually speaking was fantastic. But as much as I loved it, I was a little underwhelmed.

When ""everything everywhere all at once"" came out I thought wow,so glad this came out before multiverse of madness because people are probably going to compare and this should be enjoyed on its own; but now I can't help compare Dr strange to that movie. Hypocritical. I think I was more engaged in that one, and since I watched it recently, Dr Strange's multiverse didn't feel as novel. It felt like ""everything everywhere all at once"" but in the MCU and darker. The pacing also felt off at times, it could have been made more thrilling, and despite this being one of the more ambitious projects done by Marvel, I feel like more could have been done.

I'm also kinda disappointed by Wanda and Dr Strange because they both weren't as mighty as I thought they'd be when they fought head on. They've both shown much more power in other marvel projects. I mean, Wanda literally made Thanos ""rain fire"" in endgame despite it killing his army, and Dr strange closed up the multiverse while it was ripping apart in Spider-Man, just to mention a few. Also surprised there's no mention of Loki or the sacred timeline,time keepers. I hope they have good plans for Kang the conqueror.

I still loved this and it is great, I particularly loved the more grim aspects of it like Dr Strange's counterparts in alternate universes. Loved the hero characters that made cameos in other universes. I just think it could have been more thrilling, the movie reels us in through showing us the actual madness of the multiuniverse with prismatic visuals, but the story or plot line itself isn't much to be astounded by. They focused more on creating this amazing multiverse but they didn't really deliver a good enough story to match it. Don't be dissuaded though, it is still very much worth the watch.

And I can't wait to see Charlize Theron in the next one, Marvel really has a way of getting you excited for sequels, mastered that."
Mad or What ?,
I Went in With Low Expectations and Walked Away Very Impressed,"Every sequel has the burden of surpassing expectations or avoiding the impulse to retread the same ground. This is doubly true for the MCU.... maybe even several times over with how many movies and shows the cash cow turns out. Doctor Strange is far from the weakest entry but it's not as distinctive when compared to the rest of the expansive Marvel library. The Multiverse of Madness brings back many of the original's same characters and boasts similar action set pieces, but I was pleased by how much I could see Raimi's fingerprints on the stylistic choices. I know some critics complained about how this movie didn't push the envelope further but I thought they struck a nice balance of taking a relaxing dip as opposed to cannonballing into the pool. Between some of the more offbeat humour, the camera angles to the more horror-style pacing and action, the creative team walked a fine line. But I think they included enough to court those looking for something more akin to Raimi's zany previous works. I was also surprised at how violent some of the movie's scenes got. Some of it was implied but again, it had a surprising amount of bite and I dug it.

Stephen has been incrementally growing as a character but the Multiverse of Madness really holds a mirror up to his arrogance and his futility as a hero and I really enjoyed that decision. The character development around the board was a standout element for this movie. Strange has always come across as a less likeable and more deadpan Tony Stark and while he was willing to help Peter Parker in No Way Home, he needed some humility and its served in sizeable doses here. I also respected the route they took with Wanda's arc. Without spoiling anything, she's still reeling from the events of Wandavision. She's in considerable pain and more than a little miffed that she lost so much while others were spared. Her focus is single-minded but it never becomes too pat or too irritating. Her actions are a reflection of her hellish situation and seem dark but plausible despite the larger picture being secondary. It's a solid job by the screenwriter (Michael Waldron) and that continues in America Chavez's arc. She isn't star-struck by Strange, which would have been too easy. The good Doctor has to earn her respect and her trust, which she has every reason to withhold. The development isn't perfectly spread out but the main players are done properly and it's easier to miss on that than you'd think.

Benedict Cumberbatch is a wholly impressive actor, he rocks almost every part he's cast in. With that said however, Doctor Stephen Strange is a part that's so firmly in his wheelhouse that his casting surprised no one. I do think this might be his best performance as Stephen, he gets more emotional depth to his role and I liked that he was a more vulnerable and imperfect Doctor Strange. The true standout is Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff, this shouldn't be surprising after her stellar turn in Wandavision or in just about anything else she's in. Her character's emotional turmoil has become bottomless in this adventure and Elizabeth's emotionality helps you understand Wanda's mindset and how it has corrupted her reasoning. Elizabeth's one of the most talented actresses out there and with her continued work, I'm always going to be interested in what she's doing next. Benedict Wong and Chiwetel Ejiofor return and I liked how they also weren't given the same ground to tread. Mordo gets a nice character flip that Ejiofor is more than game for and Wong's humour is always a welcome diversion. Xochitl Gomez doesn't have any easy task but she's up to it as America Chavez. She not only has to get us to comprehend her character's plight but help open the door to Stephen's journey in the Multiverse of Madness. I was really happy to see Rachel McAdams again but if anyone got the short shrift it's her. She wasn't well utilized in the first one, she gets different material here but I still think she could have done more. I'm not going into the surprise inclusions (or incursions) in the cast, even if they've been revealed, I don't want to spoil the fun.

Multiverse doesn't feature many missteps, there are small plotholes here and there, but none of them upset me to the point where it threw me off. If there's anything that disappointed me about Multiverse, it just can't be all things to everyone. It can't be the edgy/hardcore and campy Raimi horror movie that the film buffs wanted. It can't be the revolutionary action/sci-fi superhero movie because Marvel can't clear the ever moving bar every single time (No Way Home has become the new benchmark since the Thanos/Avengers saga) and it can't escape the widening expectations of the die-hard Marvel fans. I will say this isn't the best Marvel movie and it's debatable whether it's even one of the best Marvel movies that's come out the past couple of years. But if that's the pass/fail question that you're asking yourself every time Marvel releases a movie, you might need to take a break regardless.

I went into the theatre like most of the audience for this movie, hopeful but understandably skeptical. I think people are starting to bet on when Marvel's going to buckle under its own weight. I'm suffering from a little comic book fatigue but The Multiverse of Madness has enough juice to keep the ball rolling. It gave one of Marvel's most one note characters some real emotional depth, they bring enough of the visual sensibility that made the first entry memorable while adding something new and it's a unique film in the ever expanding Marvel cinematic universe which is an accomplishment by itself. I'd rate this around an 8.5/10 but I'm rounding up to 9. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is absolutely worth seeing on the big screen and hopefully we can expect the next couple of Marvel movies to be just as invigorating."
This was a joke right?,
Rushed,
Has Marvel Missed The Mark?,"The first movie is well regarded for its mind bending visuals, and under director Sam Raimi, this sequel doubles down, dialling up the horror, the fan service, as well as adding some gruesome and shocking fight scenes we've not seen in a Marvel property before (they were awesome!!).

Although just because you can do anything and go anywhere, doesn't mean you should - the script isn't great (the villian is particularly unsympathetic), the score is peak 90s, it's sometimes hard to work out what's going on & the emotional/heart side is too simplistic for an established set of characters. Oh and it should have been funnier.

For fans, it's a big swing, and while not everything works (again, thanks script) enough connects to make it a reasonably fun, wild ride... that, and it's good to see the world's biggest franchise trying new things.

@WatchItWombat."
C+ Adequate first draft. Rewrite.,"This film has good structure and an interesting narrative, but it could be fleshed out more. Shorten action sequences to what's needed to move the story forward. Add more substantive dialogue. Explore Wanda's grief. Explain the universes. When did Wong become Sorcerer Supreme? Why did America lose her moms?"
Scarlet Witch hijacked this movie,"I enjoyed the movie, but as others have pointed out, this was really a Scarlet Witch movie with Doctor Strange, Wong, America Chavez, and Christine as supporting characters.

I never liked the Scarlet Witch character in the comic books because she was totally bi-polar and a flake, just like in the movies. Two hours of her whining and psycho BS were a drag, but at least the end made up for that.

Doctor Strange seemed to be in automatic mode. Sometimes he energized his role and seemed really into it. Other times he seemed to be playing Sherlock Holmes. I think Benedict Cumberbatch has gotten a bit too cozy as playing Dr. Strange the same all the time, and is not adding in much of his real personality or anything unique or warm about himself.

Even in dealing with America, it came off as ""Father Knows Best"" not like he really cared about her. At the end, when she is talking to him and thanking him as he walks away, Strange arrogantly brushes her off, like it is all in a day's work. It seemed like they he did not care at all, even though he did so much to treat her right, and they did so much together.

Perhaps the best part of this movie comes at the end, when we see the Eye of Agamoto and Clea finally shows up, in all her glory."
"Packs so much in, as ever does it well.....","Thoroughly enjoyed, Marvel still has it, despite the worries how they could match/keep it going after the end of the incredible Infinity Saga.

Yes, tons of action, with the usual incredible mind-blowing effects, but much more than that. More development of the Characters, Strange growing and showing further depth, Wanda's story particularly stunning following on from WandaVision and her breakdown, thankfully more for Christine Palmer to do, and then they manage not only to give a big introduction to America Chavez, AND the Illuminati (different line up to the Books, but still works), AND Wundagore, and Wanda's assault on Kama-Taj (not sure of the spelling) and Wanda facing off against the self-righteous Illuminati was a highlight... heck all in 2 hours, and so well paced, never lets up. And multiple Stranges too. Mind blowing - true Madness, in a good way.

All in all, it could probably never quite match up to the likes of Endgame (with Avengers, Guardians and everyone else) and No Way Home with 3 Spidey's, but in extending the Multi-verse further, bringing in a host of new characters, and with Wanda as the main antagonist, one of very very few who could out-power Strange, inspired. Then Clea....

Need a Lie Down.....

And after further viewings, have marked it up a further star - the stunning Marvel World creation, some truly horror images throughout. Benedict Cumberbatch IS Steven Strange, every bit as much as Downey jr. Was Tony Stark, and Chris Evens was Steve Rogers. It's either brilliant casting directors, or just superb actors, whatever - Class maintained."
I don't even want to know.,"Our movie begins with America Chavez & Doctor Strange (a different one than we know) running thru an interdimensional passageway (or something like that) being chased by some odd creature (America is a teen girl who can travel from dimension to dimension at will, though she can't control her power).

In our world, Stephen Strange awakens, gets dressed up, and heads to a wedding. After some less than happy chatting with a former doctor colleague, the wedding march begins, and see that Christine is the one getting married (😱).

Outside the church, a portal opens and America comes through, closely followed by a 1 eyed octopus-like creature. Strange switches to his normal attire and quickly pursues the chaos, closely followed by Wong joining in the ruckus.

Eventually Strange and Wong figure out that the cause of what's after America has nothing to do with them. It's witchcraft! So Strange decides to go and see the witch he knows.

We last saw Wanda at the end of WandaVision where she was hearing the voices of her two boys (that were never actually real in our world),,,

When I heard that Sam Raimi was chosen to direct this movie, I knew we were in for something,, ""interesting."" Well,, I was right!

This is quite the ""interesting"" sequel for Dr. Strange and co. There are several things about this movie that will remind you of Raimi's previous work,, and they're great!!!"
Skip this one,
My expectations weren't met,"A movie solely dedicated to Dr. Stephen Strange had one Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch in it who not only stole the invaluable limelight from our main 'protagonist', but she also had most of the intriguing sequences to her name, where she was able to break out of her shell and flaunt her true powers and abilities.

Doesn't it feel strange (no pun intended) though?

I mean, yes, we all were aware that this stand-off would eventually take place at one point and I'm delighted it did; even though, I must admit, to see this legendary battle being almost one-sided was a little bit unexpected. Look, I for one, have always felt sorry for Wanda for what had happened to her. I sympathize with her for all the tragic losses she had to endure; while her actions aren't reasonable, at the same, I could understand her pain as well as her reckless mindset.

But to witness her getting too overpowered doesn't provide me any sense of fulfillment, shockingly so! It's rather perplexing to watch her snuff off mightier fighters from another universe in a split second like they mean nothing! And let me remind you, those were not any other ordinary beings, they were the mightiest superheroes in their world!

Speaking of worlds, they had a fascinating subject like Multiverse in their hands with an abundance of possibilities and paths to delve into yet what did they do? They opted for the banalest course possible! It's freaking parallel universes we are talking of, it was meant to be grand, and eloquent in every possible way but instead, what have we got? Nothing of significance, If I'm being honest."
Best movie of MCU yet,I do belive its the best movie of marvel yet and for those who are sating that the story is week then you dont understand the mcu storyline it was amazing and deserve more ratings.
True Marvel movie experience.,"While it may have had a handful of easily forgivable shortcomings, this move was absolutely fantastic on the big screen. Action packed and a true thrill ride through the multiverse. I wanted more! Marvel truly saves the theater industry."
"Some good moments, but not enough of them.","Overall I still enjoyed the movie but it was definitely not as epic as I thought it would be. The animated series ""What if..."" did a much better job in terms of playing with the multiverse concept, or even the Loki series to be honest. So that was a bit of a letdown a movie with 'multiverse"" in the title mostly focused on one character, which is not even the one the movie is named after! So definitely not on par with older MCU flicks but still entertaining with some cool cameos here and there."
Disappointing and underwhelming.,
"Dumb plot, mediocre movie","I had great expectations of Doctor Strange 2 based on the first movie.

I am severely disappointed. The plot is pathetically weak and centered around Wanda and the 2 kids she never had.

Yeah, so they turned an Avenger into a psycho killer villain who is willing to kill everyone who stands in her way of getting these 2 kids that she never had.

Throw in some demons, ghosts and zombies into the sorry mix and you have a mess.

Boring and long. So disappointed.

On the bright side, the picture looks awesome (shot with 8K digital camera) and the Atmos sound effects are great."
An Insult to any Marvel Fan!,"I loved the first Doctor Strange. It was different, mystical and entertaining.

The Sequel however felt like a Parody and a Compilation of whats possible. Basically a creative multiversal nightmare. The story is plain boring and stupid. It felt like the people in charge wanted to cram so much into it just because the name is multiverse. The power scaling of the heros and their actions always made me question the logic and the credibility of them. In one moment they made this lame fart jokes, in the next they were emotional which they couldnt convey properly and then the movie had this gore and horror elements. I just thought the director clearly doesnt know what he is doing or he uses this movie as an experiment or something.

All in all very dissapointed and a major letdown. The mcu movies after Endgame dropped significantly in quality and i dont see any time soon anything that will change my mind. Its like they all got post covid syndrome which resulted in lower creativity."
Sam's comeback to Marvel was absolute blast.,
"Magnificent, scary and simple",
I liked it because I dont overhype it,"Its a good movie but you have to see wandavision and what if to understand it and basically any other marvel movie/series

I enjoyed it because I didnt overhype it like most fans do, making there own Theorys that they get attached to😕 and when that doesnt happen they say its a disappointment..... Or bad movie Well its not!

Just dont ruin it for yourself by overhyping every single movie."
Raimied,
Just Don't,"Possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. From the very first second of the film has its foot on the gas and doesn't let off. The film plays like a bunch of 20min episodes rammed in back to back with individual story arcs every 5min which basically results in it not having one.

I'm only giving it 2 stars because the visuals were okay. Far from the best we've seen in a Marvel Movie but passable.

Save yourself 2 hours and read a 3min synopsis of the whole film and call it a day."
A real treat for Army of Darkness fans,"Sam Rami did a beautiful job of making an MCU movie a very Sam Rami movie.

I've been an Evil Dead and Army of Darkness fan since I was a kid. I've also seen every MCU movie and show to date. Dr. Strange 2 was a big gift to fans Who have been following the MCU and Sami Rami.

This is arguably the most ambitious, and most ""comic book-esq"" MCU film to date. Really fun movie and very different than the first."
"Convoluted Story Line, Poor Acting",
Another Marvel Epic !,This movie doesn't contain any kind of a villain in it as Wanda is doing the things for her children ( which are of course imaginary ) but in a wrong way. A very good piece of acting from Benedict Cumberbatch and others too.
Standing ovation,
Compared to the first film it sucks!!!!,I want my two hours back!!! The first movie was probably one of the best movies from disney-marvel but this was so awful and painful to watch. Very bad plot and script with very cheap visual effects. I felt like I was watching another disney movie with the bad witch and the good princess?? Even the acting was bad!!! I can not understand what went so wrong to make such a bad movie. All this thing I watch was way to off.
Could have been better,"This movie could have been better. First of all, the title of the movie is totally wrong. Second, the movie was rushed too much. They could have easily extended the runtime. Third, the editing was bad. The scenes were not connected properly making it looked like different concepts are goings in every scene. Overall, it was a average movie but could have been best if not everything went wrong."
Awesome!,"Didn't quite satisfied but each and every thing like music,visuals and the crazy camera angles and overall direction is amazing. The pacing is so fast it was felt like a 1hr movie. The expections with exploring deep with multiversal stuff was shattered although the cameos and there fate was literally Mind-blowing, Wanda was total badass although at ending her story felt incomplete, dr strange and his ""other me's"" were awesome . Overall it was a Crazy Experience although it felt little incompletely complete at the end and Post credits were amazing."
The darkest marvel movie,"The film has a combination of action but at the same time something dark. We see who Scarlet Witch really is, she is very different as we knew her in the past movies (Wanda). We are introduced to several multiverses and several new characters, hinting that phase 4 will be around the multiverse."
Marvel's bait and switch in full swing,"In a new era of Marvel, the standard seems to be name a movie, pick a hero and then ignore them for the entire story while forcing replacements and ticking off tired nostalgia cameos or 'gender before story' decisions.

Very disappointed with the studio's decisions with the entire Marvel universe, this film just summed up everything wrong within the company. Director choice, CGI quality, side character actor selections, even as far as the ""villain"" motivation is just disconnected from anything interesting or clearly, based on the other reviews, what fans actually want.

That's before you even stop and question the plot holes and shamefully forced main fight scenes (which from ANY other studio would have been B-Movie gold)"
Somehow good,It is a good movie but it's fast paced so it was kinda overwhelming & chaotic :(. I think it could've been more fun if they didnt spoil so much in TV spot.
Doctor Strange in Multiverse of Zombie,"Is this a Marvel movie? I have not seen that much blood in Marvel movie. It was, more zombie or walking dead movie. And the plot is very childish. A woman who wanted to be with two children brutally killed many and burnt some .At the end of the film, only two words came to my mind.

""So What,"""
Very Strange,"This movie was weird. It has the odd style of comedy that you expect from a Sam Raimi film. I thought the special effects are particularly worthy of praise, the whole movie felt like a crazy trip. Great performances from Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen. Awesome cameos from characters I hope to see in further MCU films.

It might be the initial hype settling in, but for me this movie is easily a contender for a spot in the top 5 MCU films. Others might disagree, it's not a lighthearted adventure or crowd pleaser like ""No Way Home"" or ""Infinity War."" It stands out as something quirky and fresh. And unlike ""Eternals"", it actually has a charismatic cast and an engaging plot that makes it entertaining as well."
I love Sam Raimi and I love Doctor Strange but I hated this,"This film was so so disappointing. It downplays the main character and force feeds boring OP stoic female characters. Something that's becoming a trend for Disney. The story made no sense, they broke their own continuity, they introduced the Illuminati which should have been amazing but was just stupid. Not going to waste any more time. Hoping I can forget this one and still enjoy the first Doctor Strange. I was more excited for this than any MCU film. I loved SR's work and absolutely loved the first DS. I want to know what happened with this dumpster fire of a film. I have every film from the MCU in my library but I'm taking a break from MCU until Disney itself is WOKE from it's own foolishness."
Action. Literally ACTION,85% of this movie is action. There's no build up in any fight in this movie that make the fight great. Felt no tense at all and very weak/poor main conflict (seriously wtf). There are few things that's actually good such as mild gore and brutality to show how cruel the antagonist is even tho this was rated Pg 13+.
It's unlike every marvel movie u have seen but not in a good way,"Yeah, the movie is fun and fast, that thing will not make u bored On the other hand, the movie is silly and rushed, that thing will make u feel bad

The main problem is the plot, and making people so hyped and not give them what they want, not give them a little of it There is a lot of things that happen without a reason, and hilarious cut (I laughed at the third act)

U will like it if u are a Sam raimi fan especially when the R rated long version come to home, but if u are not a Sam raimi fan u will be distracted

° the music were good but forgettable ° the acting was good especially from olsen ° the directing is both good or bad, it depends on do u like the Sam raimi themes or not ° the visuals were amazing, but the cgi was good and not the whole movie, sometimes the cgi was bad or not good enough ° the ending was so bad omg ° the plot is bad made me don't care about any character, even the characters I was care about already

*I think that happen before the movie*

-OMG we need a villan for doctor strange! Who who who

Marvel : what about Wanda, she has a huge fan base and we can make money

-but sir, Wanda isn't a villan Marvel : make her, do anything just focus on making money

-sir we need a character to be with doctor strange

Marvel : America Chavis is great and also an LGBTQ character so we will win the LGBTQ fan base

-sir but

Marvel : just shut up.. Bring Sam raimi the fans loves him and make the title is ""multiverse of madness"" so people will make a lot of theories and come see the movie



Marvel : what!! R rated!

We want to make money not movie so we should buy it to more people.. Try to make it PG13."
Awesome.,"2 hours went by, fast. What a great story and great actors, all the way around. Been a while since i felt that my money was this well spent on a movie ticket. Not a movie for children, you have to stay focused all the time, maybe that's the reason for some low reviews."
"7.6/10 - Please, Don't Let This Be The Last MCU Film When Some Artistic Freedom is Given","That's what I call surpassing expectations.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a film I don't really wanna give a plot summary to. The plot descriptions on Letterboxd and IMDb are misleading like Loki on an especially mischievous day. I don't wanna say anything more than, this film is better going into blind, more or less. I mean, if you watch this film you're probably a Marvel fan, so you have somebackground. That's good. You probably know that there's some multiverse thing going on, and that the Scarlet Witch plays an important role in the film. That's all you need plot-wise, nothing more.

As you can probably tell by now, I had a great watching experience with this movie. There's something very, very delightful about feeling your expectations for a film of this sort being surpassed. I mean, I'm used to get from the MCU a somewhat fun film, lots of cringy one liners, forced dialogue and characters that are mostly flat or shallow. Just a capitalist effort to make as many people as possible enter the cinema and give their money to the big mouse, to Disney. But this? This one feels like an actual MOVIE, for god's sake. An actual freakin' movie.

Let's start with the visual aspect, cause it's so much better than most of the MCU easily, and it might even be the best one direction-wise. At least, the one that has the highest highlights. It's not a Kubrick film or anything, but I didn't expect this film to have so many beautiful shots, interesting compositions, unusual angles (for an MCU film).

Also, Sam Raimi has quite a background in directing horror films, and it's so delightfully evident in the aesthetic of this movie. Multiverse of Madness is probably the most brutal film in the MCU, which, by the way, was my first indication that something good is going on here. I won't give you the details, but let's say that once I've seen this eye thing going on I had such a big smile across my face. I think that the way Raimi uses the audio of the film to create and atmosphere is something that isn't done nearly as well in the rest of the MCU. The score is great, too - psychedelic at times, creepy, and yes, epic when needed. Most of the time it fits well to what's going on without trying to hard to sound like the most epic thing ever and by that ruining itself.

The real heart of the film, though, is the characters. There are many interesting motifs about self-reflection, balancing emotion with sense and determinism, something that I don't think I can say about any other MCU movie. Strange and Wanda actually go through a process here, and their characters are psychologically explored more than most characters in the MCU. It's not only showing in the dialogue or the motifs, but the very compositions of many scenes (I first noticed it in the wedding scene) put the characters in front. Actual characters, with fears and drives and feelings. Man, it just feels so good to get some quality out of the MCU.

I think that most of my problems with the film are pacing-related, since I find the pacing, especially on the first act, kinda chaotic and too fast. I mean, sure, it's still an MCU film, but I do think that stuff could've been better paced from time to time. Also, America is nothing more than a plot device, which is fine overall since I don't really think she's the focus here, but maybe a little more personality to her would've made my watching experience a little bit better.

But still, I just came out of the cinema with a huge smile on my face. I said that after watching No Way Home and Wandavision too and I will say it again - I think that the MCU could be so much better if Marvel would actually be trying to create good stories and give directors some artistic freedom. This is a prime example of that in my eyes - a Marvel film that beyond being simply good and not as mechanical or product-like as No Way Home for instance, actually has a lot of the director's heart in it. Please, let this film not be the last Marvel movie to give some artistic freedom to directors.

I'm feeling a 7.6/10 on this one. Don't let it be the last good MCU film."
Feels just like a comic book in all the best ways,"Sam Raimi is back and gives charecter doctor strange the comic book craziness he thrives on. It was truly awsome to see a stylistic comic book flick, where the picture feels right out of young Sam Raimi's imaginatination. As Marvel-superhero fatigue sets in, audiences can come to expect some awsome whacky comic fun, as the last attempt to keep us on our heels. Get ready for DC VS MARVEL: the motion picture, james gunn's pitching it!"
The Multiverse of not that much Multiverse and False Expectations,
Multiverse of Disappointment,"Not enough multiverse, not enough doctor strange. Movie was about wanda and her kids or America chevaz whatever you say. Only rating 6 out of 10 cause scarlet witch action was really good, otherwise I wouldn't even rate this movie.

Don't expect too much or don't expect for other marvel characters

Please do wait for the second post credit scene lol."
the most fun marvel I've seen lately,"Excellent, good fun movie, with the Cumberbatch cherry on top. The Evil Dead horror touches were absolutely deeeeelish!

The acting was superb from all characters.

The plot was nothing new, but oh boy it was fun to watch! It kept my attention from start to finish, and from someone with ADHD that says a lot :))

Totally recommending it, but not necessarily for children under 12, I guess."
Low expectations realized,"Not much to say. Waited for home video because I dont care for Dr Strange or Wanda. Well... this was about as good as high school play. High school plays do have their own charm sometimes and in the same way, this tries a lot of tongue in cheek stuff but it didnt work for me. The jokes were not good. The dark humor didnt connect... Mr Raimi needs to find new tricks. Doing the same thing over and over is not interesting.

The acting also fell flat mainly because it was forced. The characters are extremely unlikable. There are literally no redeeming qualities to this film except for maybe the effects. But in the end its the plot and writing the killed it. The plot... what plot? It was too silly, predictable and contradicts itself rendering it entirely moot. Not a big deal if the writing is enjoyable and there is some humor but it takes itself too seriously."
C Tier Marvel Movie,"I came into this film hyped and went out disappointed.

The style of this movie is very different from the previous Marvel releases (Eternals, & Shang-Chi) but it falls short just the same. There are no real consequences or stakes, the story is very disjointed at times. The cinematography I don't really know how to feel about as it definitely enhances some scenes but take away from some. The action sequences are uninspired and bland, and the power of the characters are all over the place. There is also one scene near the end where I burst out laughing because it felt so out of place.

Props to the main actors though as I feel they carried this movie. And hey at least they are trying something a bit different.

Among all other marvel films this is definitely in the C tier."
Another Multiverse Movie Masterpiece,"Just saw it and it was fantastic, another ""Multiverse Masterpiece"". The Pacing is fast, but it doesn't lose anything at all in terms of Character Development as Director Sam Raimi made perfect use of each and every second or frame of the Movie to tell the Story as complete as it should be.

The Action and Special Effects were awesome, and the Plot was solid. I love that Raimi also got to make fun of his Spiderman Movies with those Spiderman Jokes, for me it was one of the many highlights of the Film.

All the Actors did great, but particularly Benedict Cumberbatch, Rachel McAdams, Elizabeth Olsen and Xochitl Gomez. One of the Must-See Movies of the Year."
Could've been better!!,"I had lots expectations from this one but it didn't delivered much, this movie could have done better.

The most notable thing about the film is how many opportunities it squanders with its many supporting characters introduced and then never really getting utilised in the story (except for one). It teases endless narrative possibilities courtesy of the last Spider-Man movie doing so with its lead, but Doctor Strange 2 teases fan service only to deliver shortcomings instead of going all the way with its promise of 'madness' in the title. The good stuff is there; it just doesn't have enough story-breathing-room in the film.

In conclusion, this movie might not be what you think is going to be, so manage your expectations. The acting is great, the direction and Sam Raimi's touch are great and so is the cinematography, the music is good but disappointingly there is little to no use of Doctor Strange's iconic theme, the villain is good, the visuals are great but it needed more visuals and reality-bending from the first one, the horror aspect is fine and gives a fresh look to the MCU, but it's ultimately rushed, the pacing needed some work and needed extra time."
This film is good and scary in some ways,
Parody-level bad,"I really didn't expect this but wow, really phoning it in.

Whole scenes looked like they were from The Boys when they have a clip of their terribly done superhero movies or shows. VFX were very bad and obvious. So much of the acting is simply awful. It's like they had to rush and did only one take of every setup.

And mostly... who cares? It was such a typical bad villain, who is evil because shrug. Wants something impossible and dumb, won't listen to reason because evil, and is infinitely powerful. Really, boringly infinitely powerful. Superfans are offended that the big bad can destroy their favorite heroes and this ruins continuity but it's just typical bad movie stuff, where the villain (or a monster, or so on) is just infinitely powerful, for no clear reason.

Also not enough universes. Very little madness."
Serve too many things for fans,
"Sam Raimi, I've come to bargain.","Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness left me disappointed. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either, it was just in frustrating middle. As a fan of Sam Raimi's previous super hero films and a fan of the multiverse concept I was highly anticipating this film. But it just left me dissatisfied.

The Good: Now don't get me wrong the film has its merits. For example Sam Raimi's directing is top tier as per usual and the CGI isn't anything to write home about but it's still good nonetheless. Lots of the characters were fun to see again and some characters were fun to see for the first time. And there were some really fun cameos even though they were a bit shallow.

The Bad: But it still has its problems. And I believe the biggest problem with the film is its writing. Some of the dialogue feels clunky and character motivations ring hollow. There were clearly places they wanted to go but just didn't care how to get there which leaves the story feeling messy. The villain was interesting but they were also a bit stupid as there were easy ways to avoid conflict and the explanation just didn't make any sense. And cameos whilst they were cool they were also completely unnecessary and didn't do anything of note.

I could go on more but I probably shouldn't. If you're interested in the MCU then you should watch it as it is on Disney+ now but don't get your hopes up."
Spellbound,"You will be spellbound by the latest installment in the Marvel Universe. Sam Raimi and Marvel films is the best combination since that whole ""you got chocolate in my peanut butter, you got peanut butter in my chocalate."""
THIS MOVIE IS PURE MADNESS,
Really good movie. These bad reviews are ridiculous.,"I went into this movie with trepidation mainly due to concern over Raimi directing it. I loved Evil dead but his Spider-Man films were a big let down for me.

Much to my delight, this movie was exciting, engaging and entertaining from start to finish. I was hoping to see at worst a 7 and what I got was 8.5 - 9...

I cannot comprehend how people could say the film ""doesn't make sense"". Unless your IQ resides in the low double digits, the movie makes perfect sense. Nor as many claim is it a ""mess""... is there a lot going on? Sure. Is it fast paced? Yes... but it's all done really well and perfectly understandable.

Another attack I'm seeing is that it's too ""woke""... Hello, gay people exist.. in the comics, America Chavez has two Moms. So it makes perfect sense that she would have two moms in the movie as well. Grow up.

I also suspect much of the negativity is coming from DC fanboys who are tired of the DCU being embarrassed by the far superior movies Marvel puts out. I also suspect that due to the completely nonsensical reviews, many likely haven't even seen it and just want to hate on Marvel for whatever reason....

In the end, don't let the reviews sway you one way or the other, see it for yourself. As long you are a reasonably functional human being and aren't an incel or a DC fanboy, you're likely to really enjoy the film."
"Awesome RPX 3D experience, one of my favorite marvel films!","The only thing I don't understand is why the MPAA didn't rate this R just for terror in the bulk of it. Even with 4 hours sleep I absolutely loved Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, it's definitely wild and very well directed by Sam Rami! Stephen Strange has to fix the glitches from Sprider-Man No Way Home and so much chaos leeches through universes which stayed entertaining throughout. The entire cast is great, acting is perfect, dialogue was well written, and action was glorious! I love the theory of dreams being from another universe I think that's brilliant."
Marvel's first genuine horror film,"I expected this to be a darker entry in the MCU, but I was quite surprised how all out Raimi went with the horror. It felt refreshing to see a spin on the classic Marvel formula. Olsen delivers one of the best performances in the MCU and Doctor Strange gets a lot more character time than I expected. The story can feel a bit hacked together, which is expected given the tumultuous behind the scenes events, but it delivers all the expected emotion. Raimi proves yet again he can be wildly creative with horror as there are several scenes that really impressed me.

However, there were a lot of cameos teased for this film and I don't feel like they fully delivered. Given this is now the third MCU project in the past year to heavily feature the multiverse, I expected more to be happening with it by this point. They just keep teasing it and teasing it.

While I do find this film to be slightly disappointing given the lack of true madness in the multiverse, it overall is a pretty enjoyable time at the movies."
Extremely disappointing,", since I loved Dr. Strange and had high expectations of the sequel. As many have pointed out, this was really a WandaVision sequel and I really didn't like where they went with it. I imagine the intention was complexity, but it just descended into silliness.

The biggest problem is the sheer escalation of every round. First it's saving the city, then the country, then the planet, then saving the universe and now we're into multiverses. They might think they're being clever, opening up the possibility of endless reviving of characters and plots, but it all becomes rather meaningless after a while, since it diminishes the importance of each individual and universe - there are so many others out there!

The upshot is that I am no longer enthused about a prospective Marvel release and couldn't care less if there was never another Spider Man, Batman or even Superman movie. That doesn't mean I cannot be won over - WandaVision was excellent and I enjoyed Hawkeye, but the characters have to be appealing and the plots well structured and intelligent (without having to be complicated - the audience is there to be entertained, not baffled)."
"Attempts Too Much, Succeeds Too Little","At its best when Raimi is allowed to do his thing, the overstuffed script attempts too much, succeeds too little, & ends up the cinematic equivalent of junk food - little more than empty calories. #nitrosMovieChallenge."
"Surprising and at times exhilarating, Marvel's first horror movie delivers",
8.7 out of 10 deadites,"Enjoyable and not too tasking. Marvel is just beating the heck out of DC. Everything you see in the trailer, is what they give you. One of the minor characters is underdeveloped and it does hurt the film a little. But all good other than that."
Yet another GCI orgy,"Nothing to see, just a bunch of boring CGI effects and stupid characters with ""super powers"". Maybe this is a movie for people who've never seen a movie before. Or for kids who think CGI is real. But for the more experienced audience, this is pure nonsens. Avoid at all costs."
What a mess...,"Doctor strange : madness of the multiverse was presented as the key movie of the phase 4.

In fact there was a great build up for it if you think of the differents great series (Wanda vision, Loki, what if) and spiderman no way home (which was just amazing).

It..was a massive flop !

I feel like I didn't watch a marvel movie with great story line, with good momentum and interesting new caracters.

In many ways is more in the same dynamic of Eternals..."
"From a huge Marvel fan: Marvel, please don't go down this path",
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"Marvel delves deep into its multiverse and ultimately succeeds in spades. This film was an exciting thrill ride throughout, utilizing the standard Marvel formula and combining it with the artistic visual style of director Sam Raimi. This film was visually unlike any Marvel film, using a plethora of camera angles, transitions, and movements that will constantly bend the mind of the viewer. Although the visuals are brilliant, the film also focuses on the emotional aspect of the characters, providing heartfelt and breaking moments that are satisfying for fans of the characters. This is perfectly accompanied by masterclass performances from each actor, giving life, relatability, and heart into each line delivered or facial expression given. The cameos that occur, despite their briefness, are effective in their presentation and will undoubtedly excite. The film, however, feels a little rushed in the beginning, establishing everything the audience needs to know in a quick manner. The film also does not have as much of an emotional attachment or impact to the previous multiverse adventure in Spider-Man: No Way Home. Despite this though, the overall product delivered is an amazing experience at the cinemas and a breath of fresh air for the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
MARVEL DOES IT AGAIN!,"Marvel has done it again! This movie was incredible!! An absolute masterpiece. I loved every second of it. Benedict Cumberbatch, Benedict Wong, and Elizabeth Olsen have out done themselves. Elizabeth Olsen deserves all the awards for her role as Scarlett Witch. I was in awe and horrified of her character all at the same time. I really liked how the movie times in some prior movie(s) story lines. Marvel did an excellent job on the visual effects as well. Sam Raimi provided an exciting horror-like masterpiece. There were so many twist and turns you never see coming. I would give this a 15/10 rating if I could. I highly recommend you go watch it!! I plan on watching it multiple times!!"
Should have been released on Halloween,"Marvel's streak of very good movies, starting with Black Widow in 2021, has come to a screeching halt with this multi-confusing, convoluted Dr. Strange debacle. A proven director, this disappointing Sam Raimi effort is nothing short of a horror movie with its demons, zombies and pretty frightening (at times) effects. So much so that a mom sitting near us took her 8-year oldish son from the theater about half way through, never to return. Maybe it had something to do with watching a 16 year old girl being tortured by the Scarlet Witch. Unlike the innocent Spider-Man, Iron Man and Captain America-type movies, I would not take any one under 10 (at least) to see this.

For some reason, some of the writers in this series like to make the good guys into bad guys, and pit Avenger vs. Avenger. It's done here again with a suddenly delusional, occasionally evil Scarlet Witch, who has somehow developed powers she didn't have when facing Thanos a few movies earlier. She does do the right thing at end, but it's too late to save this scary, creature feature.ghoul fest. Not even the lame special guest appearances could help. Save yourself two hours (felt like three) and skip it."
Pointless movie plot,"Either I am tired of this multiverse shenanigans or I find this movie plot pointless and question why it was made.

The whole Illuminati sequence is senseless too."
I'm ... Conflicted,"There were aspects of this a really enjoyed but it was just so dark that it changed the whole experience for me. I think if you're like me and dislike horror films I would give this a miss, it was just too much for me, especially for what I expect from a marvel film."
Best Marvel film since 2008.,
Very disappointing Disney needs to leave marvel alone,I gave it a 4 just because of the Illuminati other than that the movie was crap. Felt like Dr. Strange was a side character in his own movie. That Latina girl was useless especially leave to Disney to shove another character down our throat to prove to another community it was just as bad as eternals. This is a one and done for me just like eternals terrible movies. I was so relieved when the movie ended literally felt like the movie was thrown together last second. Disney needs to really stop with the statements of LGTVHD and make a movie that's actually good. No Way Home is the only great movie since Endgame.
Wished I loved it,
Should titled as Wanda's Madness,"Story is okay-ish but I enjoyed it in 3D. I was expecting more multiverse and madness but they put the story in turmoil. Sam Raimi's MCU comeback is paid off and background score was matching with dark theme of characters dark side.

America Chavez role was limited but this movie should titled after Wanda's name."
Doctor uninteresting and the least interesting story about the multiverse,"This was an unexpected yawn. The first Doctor Strange-movie surprised me with how good it was. The character Doctor Strange is one of the least interesting ones of the Marvel Mcu's big league, but that movie worked because of a good story.

This time, the story is a complete mess. A lot of waving of the hands to summon CGI. Elizabeth Olsen and Cumberbatch are both good but they can't save this. I just found all plot lines kind of blah.

Top of mind, this is my next to least favorite MCU-movie so far (beating Shang Chi). Still, it's not a complete train wreck but it's not worth more than 4 stars."
"Spectacular, A Feast For The Eyes Hollywood Magic!","This flick is pure CGI entertainment, Hollywood magic, and a feast for the eyes blended with Sam Raimi's signature of horror style visuality that makes this one-of-a-kind MCU show unique and satisfying.

Doctor Strange is amazing, and Scarlet Witch is scary and unstoppable. They're great antagonist-protagonist chemistry that really captures your wild imagination of their universes.

For those who expect too much about cameos of the other MCU characters in this flick, you might only get disappointed on the show. Some scenes might have surprises though but not enough to satisfy if you are into that level of expectations."
A Whole New Ballgame...,"This movie was phenomenal! Very unexpected, too - more like a horror film or an episode of Tales From The Crypt than any Marvel movie I've ever seen. I loved all of the character tie-ins from other fandoms and the small cameos, too! That being said, this is not the cute and fun, lighthearted Marvel we have come to know. There's a dark side and direct gore that folks may or may not be expecting. I'm not squeamish and I don't scare easily, so it didn't have that effect on me, but I can easily see where it would scare a younger audience with a different expectation in mind. In fact, there was a mass exodus of a whole group of kids about halfway through the film while we were watching it. Be mindful of that, and I think you'll enjoy it as I did. The only bad thing about it was the wig they put him in. GHASTLY. 😂"
Same mistake like Kenobi,
Wow,"This movie is the best, mcu fans will fully understand the concept of this movie. Indeed, it was a Multiverse of Madness. I enjoyed every second of the movie, don't mind all negative critics."
Marvel is transitioning...now Feige needs to be fired,
Wanda & Xochitl are excellent in this trippy sequel across the multiverse!,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe's 28th feature film continues the story of Wanda & Strange from WandaVision & No Way Home and it is directed by the man who loves horror - Sam Raimi. The director is the reason why I was most excited for this film (also the repurcussions of Strange & Wanda's actions). Raimi's touch is present throughout with jump scares & gore galore!

Set after the events of #nowayhome, #DoctorStrange sets out to help #americachavez, a teenager from another universe, who is being hunted for her powers (ability to travel through the multiverse).

Sequels in the MCU aren't self-contained anymore. We have characters from multiple movies crossing over. Even here, more than Strange, it is #wanda who steals the show/has more prominence. This isn't me ranting because I personally loved the ""trip"" across a plethora of universes that is peppered with cameos!

My favourite part of this trippy sequel was Xochitl Gomez's America Chavez. It is not easy when you are beside Cumberbatch & Olsen but she stands tall! A #mcu series on her would be a great idea. Elizabeth Olsen continues to enchant us. Hers is currently the best arc in the MCU. Benedict Cumberbatch can't do anything wrong and his witty portrayal of the character is spot-on. Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Chiwetel Ejiofor & Michael Stuhlbarg reprise their roles.

Doctor Strange in the MoM's only fault lies in its duration. We as fans have come to expect longer movies from the MCU given the scale. Nevertheless, the MCU delivers yet again with Raimi at the helm. Excited to see where the multiverse takes us next!"
"What's happening, Marvel?",
Something Different and chaotic,
Better than ENDGAME.,"Yeah I said it.

I'm here for Scarlet Witch supremacy, easily the greatest character in the current roster of MCU.

Looking forward to seeing the multiverse expand more and hopefully soon we will get our MCU mutants and F4."
Enjoyable CGI fest,"I am a casual viewer of Marvel movies, not a massive fan but I do find some of them enjoyable.

This one I enjoyed immensely. It is full of humour and I managed to follow the story(!).

It builds nicely and I like the way the story develops, bringing in both familiar characters and ones I have not seen before.

If anything its a bit too CGI laden, its get a bit overwhelming from about 3/4 in, but ultimately a pleasant couple of hours.

(Lots of people left when the credits rolled - you should stay right until the very end)."
"A multidimensional adventure, a tragedy at heart, and a breathtaking spectacle.","What a mind-blowing cinematic experience ! From beginning to end it feels like a journey in which you've been sucked into... Wow.

How not to start with talking about the entire visual splendor (and visual language) of the movie, these countless insane sequences and all the amazing creativity behind this movie... How not to talk about all these striking acting performances, with characters that all add up to the emotional impact of the story, as well as expanding the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the introduction of new characters (+ the idea of many other potential alternate versions of all characters) and innumerable dimensions/universes to discover and explore...

The story at its core is strongly emotional and it is what drives every bit of the storyline... As a spectator you are invested because you can understand the good reasons and motivations of every slightest character...

The villains of the movie mainly are all the actions and choices taken by each and every character... It's like dominos all falling before your very eyes one by one !... It is heartbreaking in multiple moments, but indeed and above all this movie has heart. And also a strong message about the path that you think you should take, but why ?... What to do and why, who to trust, what you wanna bet on or believe in, and for what ?... So yes, on certain aspects (and in multiple scenes) this movie truly feels like a tragedy ; but in the end it takes an exciting direction moving forward, with new adventures, characters, potential events and stories...

And when you think about the thousands of creative and skilled people working on such an immensely mind-blowing piece of cinema, it's crazy.

This is a wonderfully crafted masterpiece... Hats off to everyone involved in the creation of this film."
If you just want to have a family just get a boyfriend and have babies!,
What were they thinking?,"This is the worst marvel movie by a long shot and one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.

How much did the director of Thor 2 pay them to dethrone them as the bottom of the barrel? I can't believe this script made it to production. Horrible, boring, and redundant plot.

We spent all of Wandavision watching her freak out about her losses.. and now it's just a movie of the same stuff?

Disney ruins everything."
"Meets expectations; low rewatch value, high entertainment value",
Lazy writing is lame,
A Comic Book comic book movie,Your enjoyment of this movie will be down to if you enjoyed reading the comics. This is the most like a comic movie Marvel has made yet. It's a completely different style of entertainment.
Wanted to immediately watch it again,"I know others have expressed differently, but I think this thing is SOOOO Raimi: creepy, zany, visually wild, free of pretense, and easily the strangest (ha) and scariest MCU film to date. The music notes segment is probably a make-or-break moment for many, and I could watch that kind of reckless creativity forever."
Sam Raimi is back,"Love the horror style, but was expecting more from this movie. It ended up sometimes confusing which I expected Lol. Wanda is shown at her best, Terrific acting from Benedict, great visuals."
Madness,"The plot and pacing can be a bit strange, but the direction of this movie is so unlike any MCU movie you have to applaud it. Benedict Cumberbatch and particularly Elizabeth Olsen shine in a strange and magical film. The glimpses of the multiverse leave you wanting more and some of it is genuinely scary."
Fantastically Strange,"Although I watched this movie the 1st day (to avoid spoilers coming my way), it took me a while t o write this review. There has been a lot of mixed opinions about this movie and I was also thinking over and weighing in my thoughts. I did not walk about of the theatre disappointed, but 2 days later I do not recall anything significant apart from the absolutely brilliant visual effects tailored for IMAX experience.

Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was always heading to be a complex movie considering what MARVEL had built up to it in the recent past. However, it lacks the strong purpose that needs to justify the movie for what it is. It is also heavily linked to Disney+ series' Wandavision and What If but it did not relate to the events from Loki which I thought would directly lead to this movie. Don't say they didn't warn you because Kevin Fiege had literally mentioned about the Disney+ series' being connected to a lot of movies in the future. This may serve the loyal fans very well and give satisfaction but this can be a risky move considering the bigger crowd. The movie of course is brilliantly made and the visuals are just breathtaking. I had loved the visual effects in the first Dr Strange movie and this movie took that to another level. The spooky elements is something new for a MARVEL movie, however it also helps this movie to lean on a bit to the darker side. The background score is unique and adds well to the overall experience.

This movie somehow falls short on expectations with the depth given to its character. Although Cumberbach eases through his role, his character does not have what it takes us to connect at an emotional level. Elizabeth Olsen is pretty good as Wanda, but her role almost makes it feel like we are watching the second season of WandaVision and most of us can totally expect what happens with her character in the climax. Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez is a very important character but the lack of writing and backstory doesn't make it so much. In fact we could have almost done without her character as well.

Benedict Wong probably is the most likeable of all and also contributes to the major part of the humour in this movie. I do not want to give out spoilers on the cameos, but all I can say is that I expected much much more and much different from them.

Dr Strange in the Multiverse of the Madness madness is definitely a satisfying IMAX 3D experience. The majority of my rating is owing to that because it definitely felt worth the buck. But when you think back long and hard you may start to have a tiny bit of worry for the new MARVEL strategy."
Quite Boring...,I was expecting the same hype of the recent Spider-Man but it was way boring and had the time of my snooze fest or slept most of the time. Visual effects were amazing as expected but storyline or phasing was not engaging.
Trash Film,"This movie is the definition of disappointment, it's the most ridiculous and stupidest Marvel movie I've ever seen, it was created just to please the wanda fans. The movie is so messy that you don't understand anything."
The best sequel since Winter Soldier,"My expectations for this film were probably too high for my own good but this movie surprised me in many ways, it's a great film but set your expectations accordingly, I really loved this film and it's one of the best MCU sequels.

Doctor Strange is one of my favorite Marvel heroes, and it's impossible for Benedict Cumberbatch to be bad as him, he's possibly the best he's ever been as Dr. Strange and Xochitl Gomez is great as America Chavez, but the real standout was Elizabeth Olsen, she was brilliant in this movie, as my least favorite Marvel character, possibly the best she's ever been as Wanda.

The action and visuals were stunning, I recommend seeing this in an imax 3D theater because it just enhances the experience, this is the scariest MCU movie to date and also the more different, Sam Raimi perfectly blurred the lines between action and horror, he did a phenomenal job helming this movie and the ending was incredible, with some of the best cameos I've ever seen.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is not cameopalooza, but I loved it, and it gets an A."
MCU is weaker and weaker,"I mean, this movie is garbage as moat of the last MCU movies.

DC overall has more quality since the 1978 Superman.

This MCU mutiberse will be inferior to DC one for sure!"
Not the greatest marvel movie ever but damn good,
Meh! Meh again!,I like the first one but this one was too silly and too confusing. I guess you have to watch Wandavision to catch up. I found it too confusing and made no sense in some places. Effects were ok but it did not make up for a full good movie. Dr Strange 3 may be coming out. Would not be for me.
Multiverse of woke,"Meeh. Weak story, poor casting in the new additions and of course they needed to add the birthing people ideology with multiple mother's.

Lumbersnatch did a surprisingly poor job in the evil section and the musical battle was ridiculous."
My poor Marvel loving heart,"I'm a big Marvel movie fan and scarlet witch and dr strange are some of my favorite characters. I've been looking forward to this movie for so long-when I walked out of it all I could think was ""what did I just watch?""

I like to go into certain movies without having seen the trailer and this was one of them. I couldn't get into the story-I didn't mind darker tones but it felt like it was trying too hard and lost at the same time.

Also, if you have young kiddos (which I do not), this movie could be quite intense and frightening for them.

Unfortunately, I'm super disappointed. I know everyone will have their own opinion and I truly hope other fans enjoy it more than I did. Here's hoping Love and Thunder is an improvement."
The Quick and The Dead,"Look. I know. The film only really makes sense if you've seen not only the twenty five previous MCU films but also now the Disney Plus TV shows and you can debate whether a film is truly working if it requires that much previously gained background knowledge before you go in. . . But here's the thing, I have. I've seen them all, even the ""Inhumans"" series, and with all that - and the fact that I'm a huge ""Evil Dead"" fan - it's not perhaps surprising that I loved this.

Still dealing with the aftereffects of saving the world, Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is called into action again when he saves a young woman, America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) from an attacking giant creature. The creature is stalking Chavez because of her power, to jump between multiverses, a power that she can't control but that has cost her dearly so far. As the pair discover who is behind the creature attack, they are forced to take refuge in an alt-world, but their antagonist discovers a dangerous way to follow them.

What I can't believe is how much the film must have been altered to greater fit the aesthetic and predilections of Sam Raimi. We're not just talking a cameo from Bruce Campbell and the Delta Oldsmobile - but sound design choices, such as the movement of the camera mimicking those from ""The Evil Dead"", the hell monsters that resemble Dead-ites and there are even music cues that sound like ones from that series. It was excellent to the small percentage of a modern audience who could relate the two properties.

As I say, I can't imagine what anyone who hasn't seen ""Wandavision"" might have made of it, but I was certainly all for perhaps the most 'inside baseball' film the MCU have made so far. It was funny, it looked great and was definitely the most horror infused that the series has been. You can't talk about the cameos - though if you've got this far without seeing the film and not seen those cameos online somewhere, really well done.

There are dozens of other aspects of the movie that I could talk about, characters and moments, but I've already surpassed my usual word limit. Suffice it to say that I really liked this, and I can't wait for ""Thor"", ""Ms. Marvel"" and whatever Sam Raimi decides to do next."
Wanda Maximoff Owned This Movie,"She is Dark and Marvelous and single handily kicked everyone ass.

The rest of the movie sucks, they almost ruined it. They should call the movie wanda vision 2."
Vishanti Meets Darkhold,
Evil dead 4??,This kinda seemed like an evil dead crossover lots of plot holes which would be fine for evil dead and other such cult classics (it's part of what makes those movies so much fun actually) but it doesn't fit for what should be expected in the mcu.
Winking zombie,"+ Director Sam Raimi, some fresh blood added to the Marvel Universe + You can see multiple horror movie elements and references + The complicated Multiverse story is surprisingly easy to follow and understand

Do we really need all this Multiverse stuff?


Easy to kill a bunch of loved characters if those are not ""real"" but from another Multiverse."
All eyes on Strange,
"Pretty great, not Spider-Man, but super fun","Action packed from the first moment to the last.

Pros: -Graphics were amazing -Good story/plot -Character development -Integration of other Marvel characters -Wong was fantastic -Wanda's power on display yet again

Cons: -New character who could move between universes wasn't relatable -The Star graphics of her moving between universes was tacky -Not enough Rachel McAdams -It may have been better titled a Wanda themed movie since it felt like it was more focused on her."
Cameos(Fanservice) wasn't there = not good movie??,"I think why people a little bit underwhelmed when they watched this movie is because they expect cameos (fanservice) like they want to like in the Spider-Man. But when it wasn't they disappointed. And also for the story that can a little bit hard to follow because they had to watch a few series and movies to understand this movie

But for the people that watched just for the movie, the story how it goes and to see how Sam R is directing this movie. This movie would be fun to watch and a little bit scared because Sam really put the horror out there not just fot the hot minute 😅, i love the coloring for this movie and maybe not too much for the music part and soundtrack because it's ruining a little bit, standing ovation for Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen for the acting in this movie because they were INCREDIBLE and can't wait for Xochitl Gomez to acting as America Chavez more."
New and enjoyable,I was definitely a little skeptical of how much enjoyment I would get out of this movie since I've been getting pretty tired of the multiverse but the new director really brought a lot of new life into this kind of story and made it a much more enjoyable experience.
Miss the Spark,Not engaging from the Start.. Felt the same boring like watching the eternals... VFX are good but this movie miss the charms of The MCU. Looks like director completed the movie in hurry.
I Loved It!!!!!!,"Nothing wrong with it. The problem is, nowadays every time people watch a Marvel movie, they expect an endgame level experience. That's not how it works, there needs to be a buildup to another experience of that magnitude. This movie does that well.

Cameo's are well placed and enough to provide excitement. VFX is phenomenal and the performance of the actors were awesome. The movie stays with you even after exiting the theaters."
"Better than expected, even surprised me","Not what I expected after all the trailers and sneak previews. Much better than the Spidey version of multiverses. Although I did not like the final 10 secs of it.

Always a pleasure to see Wanda again, and finally understand why she had her own spin-off series.

One thing makes me wonder, are we in a parallel universum hype? Nevertheless, the twist on that is nicely done in this movie. Where most interpretations of parallel universes look alike, it is not the case here. I won't spoil anything, but we do finally get to know how many universes there are....."
I used to be a marvel fan...,"I am watching it right now and decided to stop because.... What is this load of bull?

I think Mr Scorsese is right and i also think american movies are getting worse every year it's like they do it on purpose..."
Sam Raim and Elizabeth show all the way,"Straightforward story, Benedict taking the back seat will certainly disappoint a few. Nevertheless,it was Elizabeth Olsen show all the way, with Sam Raimi's mark written all over the movie. Benedict was at his usual best, top-notch job from Danny Elfman and John Mathieson. I won't say lower your expectations, that'd be supporting mediocrity, it's indeed an entertaining watch, just missed the opportunity to become one of the best."
I love this film. And I love Doctor Strange. And I love Wanda,
Amazingly mixing violence and horror with superheroes.,
Great film,"This is a step away from the usual Marvel movie (which I love) in a fantastic way.

The whole cast is brilliant. It's a great story for Strange and Wanda (ignore the row over whose best - they are both superb).

It's a good story, it has cameos to keep those wanted them happy but they do not overshadow the story.

It has humour, emotional and just some cool superhero stuff. I loved it."
Solid mid tier Marvel,"As I was leaving the cinema it was hard to ignore the general feeling of this film being slightly anti-climactic.

Now don't get me wrong. It is very fun, with some incredibly cool moments, and it's a very solid instalment into the MCU.

We get to see Scarlet Witch let properly loose which is truly fantastic to watch. The film is its best when focusing on her, giving us a nice continuation of the WandaVision arc. As a result though I think the Doctor Strange character lost a bit, and he maybe felt a bit flat in comparison. Overall though a very enjoyable story with some great action.

The direction from Raimi is very good. He injects his unique campy horror style, which is obviously watered down for a PG13 project, but makes for a very atmospheric and engaging film. Visually I thought it was a treat.

As always with Marvel, there are some nice little surprises and cameos which set up some future branches of the MCU nicely.

A solid and enjoyable film, but not quite top tier Marvel which I maybe thought it would be going into it."
Starting to get a little repetitive,"As expected, lots of action, fast paced brilliant imagery and cgi. The plot is however lacking and a day later I couldn't try to even explain what the movie was actually about - too much magic powers, arms waving and things blowing up etc... with little substance. Nothing like the first Iran Man or Captain America which I consider to be great movies of this genre with a great combination of story and visual effects - starting to feel tired, like Star Wars franchise - they've had a great run just need to work harder on the storyline before they destroy it altogether..."
Multitudinal Enjoyment!,"9/10

An exciting adventure across the multiverse with interesting characters, entertaining interactions & intersecting storylines.

The concept of ""The Multiverse"" gives the screenwriters freedom to do as they please. This results in mostly cool scenarios and a few scenes designed to shock.

Definitely worth watching as a Marvel fan. The rest could still enjoy it as it is still easy to follow.

The special effects are also so good now that the movie is an incredibly immersive experience.

Madness in all Multiverses while watching,"A poor script ruins what otherwise would be a great Doctor Strange and Wanda movie with new characters and elements that don't blend well at all,leaving it with a bad movie that's not worthy of the key characters we used to love. 4 for some of the action and visual effects in an otherwise bad movie. Note: saw the movie three times."
So bad plot and script. No actors could save this movie.,"Giving this 3 stars is generous!

After Avengers and Endgame...

Marvel has been fumbling, stumbeling and just throwing whatever at the walls to see what sticks...

Think it will be many years until we get anything close to that again.

Atleast from Marvel......"
"The mulitiverse was the worst idea, and this is proof 🙄","I'll enrage the MCU fans but honestly when they ran out of ideas the mulitiverse saved them, at least financially. This has good moments but some of the effects early on are pretty ropey and the whole mulitiverse thing is just annoying and confusing. It's getting like Line Of Duty - you have to watch this with a notebook to work out who is who! Come back Marvel, give us more origin stories and leave the mulitiverse alone, Spiderman did thst well, bu this was a complex exlsove dissapointing mess."
Happy I did not have to pay for it ...,"... if you believe that throwing money solves problems for politicians, you probably believe that throwing multiple action scenes, story lines - let alone universes gains viewership ... good luck."
still got the magic,"Sam Raimi I really love. Not so sure I am in love with the Dr Strange super hero stuff though. Its pretty formulaic, like many of the core marvel stuff. Where it bloomed for me was in the special effects department. You can see the creativity he brought to Evil Dead still alive in this movie. Even a cameo from Bruce Campbell."
This has killed the MCU for me,
It was good!,"I was expecting more multiverse in the movie but I felt maybe that would have messed up the pacing. I was not expecting a lot of things (like I did with Spider-Man). Overall it was a good movie to watch, good job to the actors and team!"
"Srsly, Chavez?",I mean... Was Chavez really the best last name they could choose to portray latin American people? And now that we're on the subject... there's better actresses
One of the worst MCU fims...,"Let's look at Dr. Strange from the perspective of what's going on with MCU: 1. Cheap and bad looking CGI and visual effects. Doctor Strange looks really really bad.

2. Insanely cut scripts. The whole Dr. Strange story looks like it appeared out of nowhere...Just like it's main character A. Chavez. Like there's a film lost between WandaVision and Strange. Was this movie just a bunch of fun service episodes?

3. Like every other current MCU projects it exists in vacuum from the world changing events, that happened in previous films.

In summary, almost everything that they're doing right now is starting to look like a spit in a face to all MCU fans. Just stop making billions films and tv shows a year and concentrate on quality..."
Marvel and Disney spiraling down a hill,"What a boring broken up hole infesting script. I love super hero movies but this one lacked character and good acting. My gosh is Hollywood that desperate for talent? Miss the days of XMen, Logan, Spider-Man (Toby)........ The movies now are political and social postering instead of talent base (actors, actresses, and writers)...... we need america to take a break from super hero movies. It's dumbing down the quality."
Did IMAX enhance it?,
There's a lot to talk about here,"Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch are my two absolute favorite Marvel characters, going right back to the comics, so having them both play lead roles in the same big movie is kind of a dream come true. I've been waiting for this one. So does it measure up? First off, it has the same high-level production values we now expect, and then some; this is a special effects riot going almost into sensory overload. There's enough in the way of action scenes to satisfy anyone in the popcorn brigade, lots of characters to follow, and an extended centerpiece 'Illuminati' sequence that is in danger of just tipping over into pure fan-service territory but somehow manages to be more than just a crazy detour -- it actually moves the storyline forward.

And before I forget to mention it -- the mid-credits scene was *exactly* what I was hoping for! Introducing, with flair, a central, long-time character from Dr. Strange's comics history who ought to have been there right from his first movie. I just wanted more and I wonder if this might set up not Doctor Strange #3 but a limited streaming series instead. Why not? The MCU did big stuff with WandaVision and What If and Loki, so ... why not this? A great storyline awaits.

And the acting is never less than good. Benedict Cumberbatch has the basics of the title role down pat, and the script gives him a little extra time (not much, unfortunately -- it would have been a better film to do more) to expand the emotional range of the good Doctor and humanize him a bit more. Elizabeth Olsen as the co-lead might be the standout though --she is a very fine actor and her nuanced expressions are worth just as much as her dialog. Newcomer Xochitl Gomez doesn't have a very complex job to do but is perfectly fine playing someone who is basically just a scared kid on the run. But one thing that pleasantly surprised me was Rachel McAdams; I thought her Christine Palmer character was going to be just a short sidelight, but she (or actually, one of her multiverse analogs) had a satisfyingly big role to play.

Visually, they really lean in to the multiverse concept where no matter what you dream or imagine it's out there somewhere. I'm still left wanting more (for example, in the early Steve Ditko/Stan Lee comics they imagined mystic landscapes built out of nothing but geometric shapes and magic portals) but it is a step forward from Strange #1. And there's a fun ""wizard's duel"" scene where the weapons are sharpened musical notes and sound bites. More of that kind of thing would have been great.

New concepts are important too. Credit to the writers for using dream and dreaming as a running theme and for coming up with the idea of 'dream-walking' as a way of travelling the multiverse, if you can control it properly. Turns out it takes a lot of discipline and focus to be a first-rate villain, as we see here. On the other hand, there's Wundagore Mountain, which seems completely out of place. In the comics it's the home of the High Evolutionary and generally a place for good. Here in the movie they turn it into a nexus of evil. I guess they just thought the name was cool.

OK, now to talk about the real central issue of the film. If you haven't seen it yet, don't read on! This is your SPOILER ALERT.

So here we go.

Marvel did an incredible job of keeping all this under wraps right up to general release: the main villain is, in fact, Wanda. The reason given in the story is perfectly clear -- the Darkhold book last seen in WandaVision has given her not just enhanced power but corrupted her mind. Delving into it was a big mistake. Without it, it's implied, she'd have gradually come to terms with the loss of her fantasy children (and husband) and at least have stayed on the side of good. That's the condition we last saw her in at the end of WandaVision. Her central tragedy is that she now has the ability to get what she wants, i.e. Access to the multiverse where somewhere her two boys are real.

I guess it's obvious that they didn't have to do this to her. Can't she EVER catch a break? She lost her parents, her brother, her husband, her idyllic homelife and children (that admittedly were of her own imagining). Enough already! It borrows a lot from some of the recent comics, where Wanda essentially goes insane and releases destructive magic at a world-changing level (though in the comics, nobody ever stays permanently dead and there's no path that can't be rewritten). There are a number of pretty troubling messages here not far under the surface. For example, that a woman who's too powerful must be destroyed? (Remember Phoenix?) This all seems misogynistic in the extreme. Just two days after the movie released I've already seen pro reviewers out there rip the writers for exactly this, and for sure there will be more.

On the other hand: why *can't* the Big Bad Villain be a female? In the MCU we've already had Thanos, Ultron, the Mandarin, Doc Ock, Green Goblin, Zemo, Magneto, and a bunch more. Isn't it a weird but valid sort of gender equity to have a woman play such a role? Are we still that stuck in stereotypes? What about ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned""? No. Hell hath no fury like a mother who's lost her children. This is a kind of motivation that is purely a woman's, so why not run with it? Oddly enough, old Disney movies are no strangers to evil witches; I guess they were either way before or way behind their time.

The main problem I'm left with is that I would have been a lot happier if Wanda had been a protagonist and the pair of them fought a common enemy. I just want to see her on the side of good. Which, by the very end, she is, but it looks like the only way we'll see her again is through a multiversal, less powered version of her. I hope so because she's a great character to work with. But maybe that's just something for me to adjust to. The path the production crew chose to go with was one of the logical possibilities coming out of WandaVision, just not the one I would have preferred."
Wanda Vision in the Multverse where she wants kids,
I wish the movie was called Wanda's children and not Doctor Strange,
Cool Visuals but That's About It...,"Watched this on Disney+. Hands down the IMAX enhanced visuals and the colors are incredible. Also the CGI looks very real. From a camera work and also visuals perspective this movie checks all the boxes, but apart from that there isn't much else to praise.

The story is not enjoyable. It makes no sense. Doctor Strange and Wanda actors have 0 chemistry together I didn't like this combo. Also there seems to be a lot of dark horror vibes present in the movie for some reason. God I wish this was a Spiderman - Venom movie but it isn't, this is Doctor Strange 2, so these scenes don't match with the movie's thematics.

Overall I felt quite disappointed by Doctor Strange 2, at the end of the movie I was left with nothing...no strong message, honestly I was expecting more out of it."
What this movie is the MCU is what Blade was to Marvel in the superhero genre...,"20 years ago, horror director Sam Raimi released his first true superhero movie, Spider-Man, to critical and succesfull acclaim, followed by two sequels which did quite well for him so much that he went back to horror movies again through his company Ghost House Pictures. Since then, Marvel decided to create a universe where characters would interact with each other in serialized movies which resulted in the MCU. 10 years ago, that culminated in the biggest team up ever...The Avengers, which at the time had the highest opening weekend for a tentpole movie in May and had legs. Flash forward to 2022, and the Avengers have broken up, and we got Doctor Strange in a multiverse of madness, where he will face many foes and new friends. In order to understand this, watch Wandavision, What If, and the preceding movies. Be sure to stay after the end for some cool bonus scenes. It was worth seeing in fake 3d and for the 3d avatar 2 teaser."
Underwhelming multiverse,"Pretty underwhelming movie overall, waste of potential. It didnt live up to the hype, doctor strange's abilities and understanding of the mystic arts changes drastically depending on what the plot needs.. One film he's completely changing the properties of the universe and the next film he struggles to defeat a giant octupus, even though he can change and manipulate matter? And why is he so shocked that there's other versions of him after the clear events in Spiderman NWH. Tbh I gave it an extra star cause I love MCU but cant bring myself to the level of thirst thats making MCU fanboys drop 10-star ratings on this mess."
Felt like a stretched out Disney+ episode instead of a movie,"It's hard to describe, but the overall quality of the movie from writing, to especial effects, to characters are pretty low. And the multiverse had so much potential, but was disappointing. Overall just a mess of a movie."
Not enough multiverse and a little too disturbing,
Poor way to introduce anticipated heroes,
A wast of time with few good moments.,"Marvel's recipe has run out. A good character like Dr. Strange faces his worst enemy: a bland story full of rehashes and with just a hint of originality. In short: a powerful sorcerer must face a witch traumatized by the loss of children she never had, while out of nowhere appears a girl who travels from universe to universe whose importance to the story is zero. Here the great protagonist is the trauma of wanting to be a mother and not being able to experience it in the reality that corresponds to us. Then a lot of things happen that involve death, destruction, the disappearance of universes, the appearance of fantastic creatures and all of that could have been resolved by going to the psychiatrist. On the other hand we have a tribute to Star Wars since a black traitor appears who in turn is supported by robots that look like C-3PO; Billy Dee Williams should be happy. The mental smallness of the characters is inconceivable: Dr. Strange cannot overcome his bad luck in love, the villain of the story should be in an insane asylum and her delusions do not support the movie and the young Latina is as transcendent as a zero . With few visual moments that catch the viewer (and a nice cameo by Bruce Campbell) Sam Raimi's work is just that of a craftsman who does his job but can't achieve anything wonderful with the lousy story of the film. The film is bad even though it holds up visually."
"Too many bad reviews, just ignore them","Just go watch the movie, and be the judge.

I guess DCEU fans just don't know what a great movie with a great director and cast looks like.

The continuity in details with the easter eggs make a winning combo, and with B Cumberbatch as a lead and Raimi behind the camera, what can i say? I couldn't ask for more."
"""You break the rules,and become a hero. I do it and I become the enemy.""",
So very disappointing,"After no way home, I was really excited for this film. Sadly, it is utterly littered with plot holes, plot conveniences and inconsistencies. Motivations don't make sense, exciting new characters are wasted and characters we know well behave completely out of character. I'm not sure how much Raimi's vision was messed with by the studio, but his horror touches honestly felt extremely out of place. I'm a long term fan of Danny Elfman too, but his score was horrible - really upped the cringe in a lot of scenes.

It's just so disappointing that so much talent and money can be wasted on awful, lazy writing. The cast were great."
"Very cool, loved it.",
enjoying the madness,"This movie is quite enjoyable if you ride along with it. Yes, there is lot happening here and there is a few things that doesnt make sense. But overall, the goals of each characters are clear and we move forward trough the multiverse discovering all sort of new rules. The main antagonist is great and gruesome with a motivation that make sense... and that is lot more than the vast majority of the MCU Villains. I was also surprise by the horror/blood element. Dont bring young kids there. It is not Spiderman ! By the end of the movie, we had a whole story that tied loose ends and introduced a whole bunch of new characters that we will eventually see evolve in futures film. Benedict Cumberbach is great, as always. The humor is very Sam Raimy oriented and manage to make me laugh a few time... I really enjoy this one."
Touching,"The film was very well done, I really felt connected to the characters BUT I REALLY wish they had given the villain the win this time around. It would've really changed the feel of the entire movie and it would've been a great ending even if they had to write out a certain someone. GOOD FILM BUT THE VILLAIN SHOULD'VE WON."
"Bad story writing, the conflict is upsetting.",
A couple cringey moments but overall I loved it.,
Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi's Car Live!,I enjoyed this entry to the Marvel universe yet as a diehard Sam Raimi fan I came primarily for the inevitable Bruce Campbell cameo as the Pizzaball Vendor and Sam Raimi's 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 spinning in midair. At times the Marvel films start to feel like they're repeating themselves. How often can you see an actor pose dramatically while they unleash their CGI powers upon a villain and send them flying back forty feet? Luckily the Marvel brand humor and snappy dialogue is still here along with two great stinger scenes during and after the end credits. Benedict Cumberbatch of course steals the show as Doctor Stephen Strange. Bruce Campbell forever!
Why,
BAD WRITER MAKES ME WORRY ABOUT FUTURE OF MCU.,"I am a huge MARVEL fan ,yeah even more than you the one reading,Movie as a random watch was really good just because of the actors and the director but the lazy and inexperienced writing ruined such a hyped movies,no background on who America Chavez was,how was she a best friend to Dr. Strange? So many holes in the writing,Like why would they keep talking if Wanda is chasing them? They don't show anything multiversal in this movies ,it's just read is green and green is red that was it ,there was just madness,I really wished a good writer was given the job not some corporate ass kisser. The fight scenes were underwhelming,as you have a big fight you expect anhilation but here not even a window breaks, Story was so bad,Make me sacred for MCUs future and who the fk is even America Chavez anyway?"
A different marvel film,I watched the trailer and went without knowing anything. I was completely blown away by the path that this film took. I don't get why people are hating this film. It deviated from other marvel films but for good. My only criticism is they should've increased the drama a bit more for a proper impact of some scenes.
11 years ago today on date 5/6 I saw my first theatre MCU movie. That movie was Thor,
A great film in spite of a fairly weak plot,
The cinematography was stunning!,
Great Multiverse Movie!,"A great Marvel cinematic movie filled with surprises, magic, cameos, and action! It is entertaining to say the least and it had me intrigued from beginning to end. The post credit scenes were alright, though."
"Solid, minus some of the baggage...","Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness feels like a fantasy literature movie blended with qualities of a horror film so beware of taking young children to watch in theaters! The film is reminiscent of Harry Potter but on steroids. Overall, it is very fast paced and feels a little rushed, but it's held together well enough in specific sequences that gives audiences time to discern and much needed punctuation. The movie is peppered with themes much darker than the usual MCU flick and the director does a well enough job to piece together and answer unanswered questions from previous films and from the WandaVision sitcom. I believe this movie earned a solid 7.5 based on the action and intriguing plot. There were plenty of cringe and groundless inferences and ideas that disappointed me throughout the film but I could understand why those decisions were made by the production crew."
Multiverse of Raminess,"When Multiverse of Madness was first announced it was pitched as Marvels take on a family friendly horror film but as the years have gone by expectation shifted towards a cameo heavy alternative reality fest. While there certainly are alternate realities and cameos its very much the original pitch that dominates proceedings and the right call was definitely made.

Probably more than any other director so far, Sam Rami is given reign to put his stamp all over the movie and he has no time for deep dive multiverse nonsense. In fact the one big cameo section is treated almost as a bait and switch joke which, while it will undoubtedly annoy some fans, works perfectly for this film. Most of runtime plays out like a Terminator film with our heroes trying to escape an unstoppable foe and there are plenty of Rami tricks (and Evil Dead references) along the way, although it it a little (Dr) strange to see this amount of editing in an MCU film.

There are some moments of genuine horror for a family film and, an uninspiring attack on the Wizard stronghold of Kamer-Taj aside, plenty of visual flourishes to match the first Dr Strange movie. There are a couple of problems, attempts to illicit sympathy with villain fall flat and some of the stylistic choices made will put some viewers off but it stands as one of the more unique and interesting Marvel offerings."
I'm left feeling unsure,"My gut feeling about DR Strange is he's better as a cameo in other films, too much time on him I feel it ends up a bit convoluted borderline nonsensical but also easier as it's so easy to explain anything away.

This was far better than the first, the action, story, acting and effects were all a big improvement. However with marvel films I feel they have this ""living up to the buzz"" that trailers and other things they do create for films. In this respect it did not, the cameos whilst cool were short lived and I did pop for a couple overall after reading and watching so much I feel this promised way more than it delivered, but I guess that's what it's for, you'll always go and see it so the money is there, until disappointment turns to non attendance then there will be these feelings.

Do I like waiting for cut scenes? Not really, we're they that exciting? Well one had a new cool actress and one was literally mocking you for staying so no, got no excitement from that.

But key, does this make you want more dr strange? Answer for me is yes but only in cameos or spin offs with other people, him alone is a pass for me. I don't love the character, I don't really enjoy his variance of the universe and the people in his direct company.

There were the usual attempts at woke which always crop up now, par for the course but still sadly so blatant.

Overall it's a rainy Sunday film not a classic marvel you will rewatch. I'd definitely not watch it again. But I have to admit the standard of marvel films from ten rings to eternals to venom, the quality seems to be dropping, they almost need a new hot star to base a franchise around. Or stagger the films better so you don't have too many niche ones."
Came Close to Going Off the Rails,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie. It was a nice departure from the other Marvel movies. I was never a fan of the Dr. Strange comics, but the first movie was pretty good and this one is good, too.

My problem is there is so much going on and if you have not kept up with all the movies and TV shows, you might be lost if you just watched this movie alone. The special effects are awesome. But there are so many characters and plot lines running through this movie (as well as some of the TV shows for which it draws plot lines) that its really easy to get lost in it all. I'm not a fan of the multiverse plot, but so far it seems to be working. In a less masterful hand, this could have easily gone off the rails into a huge mess, but Raimi keeps up the pace and Cumberbatch is an outstanding actor so the movie manages to be chaotic, but not crazy.

I really hate what they did with Wanda/Scarlet Witch. I love Elizabeth Olsen and I always thought her character was fantastic in the movies and the WandaVision show. I know her character turns evil in the comics, but it seems like such a waste of the character to have her turn evil.

The cameos were a nice touch, but I think the movie would have been a bit tighter without them. Unless they plan on reusing these actors in ""our"" Marvel universe (also known as Earth 616), then they were extremely pointless.

Overall, I found the movie entertaining and fun to watch. The actors are all at the top of their game and Raimi does a great job of keeping everything moving forward."
DR STRANGE REALLY?,"Ok, We know Feige is MCU whitewashed Wanda fan but this is DR STRANGE MOVIE NOT WENDY MAXIMOFF. I'm sorry for benedict. Everyone said this movie is scary, it may be scary compared to other MCU movies, but believe me, it's not too much to exaggerate. The movie is only focused on fan service and wanda, even if the first half is good, it is broken and confused. I wish raimi only directed a movie with dr strange not wanda maximoff. It's all mcu's fault for making a bad movie after putting the fans in anticipation. The problem isn't that Wanda is strong, it's that STRANGE is ignored maybe he's the most important character in marvel right now."
Amazing movie,"As I said its a great movie. The only thing I didn't like is a certain scene which is kinda unrealistic, also there is a single plot mistake. Other than that amazing. Also the post-credit scene is not worth the waiting."
Please send me to an au where this movie does not exist,
Interesting,"I like first Doctor Strange and the character and personality find this second movie intersting. Amazing visual effects...and intersting story..but watch carefully because this Multiverse is really madness, if you miss something. Like the ending...definitely new movie of Doctor Strange is coming and new characters."
Like being on a rollercoaster,
Reed Richards,
I think the MCU is done...,"Honestly, every MCU movie after Endgame have felt lacking. I don't know what happened, but the writing has severely declined. No Way Home was OK, but Eternals was horrible. The rest was fairly mediocre.

This movie is a mess. Luckily, Sam Raimi manages to give us a few visually interesting sequences and some great humor. However, everything else felt like a Disney+ show.

The more I think of it, the worse it gets.

The next Thor and Guardians movies will most likely will be fine. I want to give Taika Waititi and James Gunn the benefit of the doubt, as Ragnarok and Gunn's films have been good.

Still, the MCU is not what it used to.

Shame."
Weird choices from Marvel,
Marvel Multiverse explosion with one question: Villain or hero?,"Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) gets pulled into another story of the multiverse after the most recent ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"". This time Doctor Stranges faces a new adventure leading him through many dimensions of the multiverse with the innocent young girl and multiverse traveler America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez).

Their opponent is no other than the evil Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) whose aim is to get the power to find her own gain and flight from all pain and sorrow she had faced as Wanda Maximoff. The journey through alternative universes unfolds a story of good and evil and choices.

Director Sam Raimi brings us into a multidimensional, fantastic movie experience from start to finish, with steady pacing, haunting chapters and rich visuals. The action scenes and demonstration of creative art could be just summarized as eye-candy. Recommended for everyone who likes to dive into the multiverse of Marvel - new fans and diehard ones alike."
Incredible in iMax 3D!!!,Do yourself A favor. See Dr. Strange In The Multiverse of Madness in iMax 3D! The 3D effects fits like a glove with this movie. The way it emerges you into the layers of multiple universes and stunning complex action/fight scenes is quite awesome. It creates an exciting layer that propels this movie forward. Normally I don't like 3D movies. I really only have seen two other movies that I liked in 3D. Avatar and Gravity. Everything else has been garbage. Now I've seen three! It's that much better in 3D. I saw Dr. Strange In The Multiverse of Madness first in 2D and it was kind of dull and underwhelming in that setting. After my iMax 3D experience I went from a rating of 6 to a rating of 8.5. It truly makes a difference!
Comicbook Movie,This felt like an actual comicbook movie. I could easily see them running it through a comicifier and taking screenshots every few seconds and printing it into a book.
"Terrible, another Marvel miss since Eternals","The plot line was all over the place, CGI was excellent in many scenes and felt very cheap in others. Much of the camera angles were cheesy, a telltale sign of a Raimi film

Direction: I was very disappointed, film was not even fun.

The film did not shy away from pushing a political agenda, which isn't necessarily bad, but certainly felt forced and cheesy.

Example; a character mentions that everything in a certain multiverse is free, and everything in most multiverses are free for that matter

It's generally best to keep politics out of a movie meant for such a broad audience, that will usually win over critics as well

Pacing: The fact that they cut 40 minutes of extra footage in an attempt to make this the best it could have been saddens me. Almost worth the price of admission just for some certain scenes that were graphically stunning, but do not go in there expecting a true Marvel movie because that is not what you are going to get. The movie tends to feel like it is dragging along and some scenes are much longer than they need to be and feel like nothing but fillers.

Plot and Contents: The movie starts off very intriguing and easily captivates your attention, and then suddenly once an endless amount of plot holes occur, suddenly the movie feels like something you have to watch rather than something you want to.

Marvel movies generally have some plot holes here and there, but this was just ridiculous.

The language and dialogue was essentially PG-13, but much of the violence is R and will shock many younger viewers

My overall review 4.7/10."
watchable,"Actually, I had a lot of expectations for the film before it was released, thanks to all the commercials and trailers that had me so excited. This film features all of Raimi's trademarks, including outstanding camera angles, editing, and colour grading, as well as the horrific tone that he is known for. Aside from the positive aspects of the film, it has a number of clumsy phrases and script. This film contains several story flaws. There are many aspects in this film that may be used in future films, but they just...throw it in weird ways that I never understand. As an MCU fan, this makes me really upset. As I have stated, without Raimi's directing approach, this will be far worse."
And breathe!,"Another marvel film where expectations were extremely high & I believe it was able to meet most of the expectations.

There were moments in this film which just made me smile, largely related to Wanda which I think surprises nobody! Especially a 10 minute sequence which is the most shocking comic book movie moment I've experienced in the cinema, if you've seen the film you'll know what I'm taking about

I also really appreciated America Chavez & Dr Strange's relationship development during this film and hope we get to see more of it going forward. A big shout out to Xochitl Gomez for her performance!

Sam Raimi brings a new flair to the MCU with some great horror aspects while Danny Elfman delivers a super soundtrack.

My one downside is the story is almost pointless at times, I feel like certain aspects could have been slowed down and developed more but I was never bored in this film due to the rapid pacing.

Benedict cumberbatch is now a powerhouse in the MCU while Lizzie Olsen just delivers every beat, continuing from her fantastic WandaVision performance, I wish she could be in every marvel project.

I'm pleased with the worldbuilding introduced and hope they are expanded in future features. I'm excited for what's to come!"
This is not Doctor Strange movie,"Watching the whole movie makes me quite confused about whether this is a Doctor Strange movie or a Wanda movie. There is not much in-depth description of Doctor Strange's feelings. Instead, we can learn about Wanda's emotional changes through this movie.

Before watching this movie, I will give you a few reminders:

1. Make sure you've finished watching Wandavision.

2. A lot of jump scares

3. If you are interested in the subject of the multiverse, then I suggest you watch Everything Everywhere All At Once, it is much better than this movie."
Gone Mad with this MULTIVERSE,
Dr. Boring in the Multi-mess of inconstancies,"God damn it. I'm quite positive in general about MCU movies, I think they are entertaining and have good production which don't make look cheap. But this was unfortunately not entertaining at all and felt really cheap, messy and inconsistent. The movie feel way too long for what it has to narrate. And the CGI, good lord, was really disturbing at some points. Sometime you see the style of Raimi, but it never really feel consistent with what you see."
Sam Raimi went wild!,"The whole story is more like a Wanda story where the whole entire movie is Wanda's arc and I love the arc that they gave her and I personally think that Elizabeth Olsen was the standout in this film. I love the way that they made Wanda look scary like an evil looking witch or more like a ghost. I love the weirdness, the goofiness that Sam Raimi did to this movie, and I though he did an excellent job of turning The Evil Dead movie into a PG-13 Marvel horror movie and show us how scary can Marvel movie be. Now there is some huge story problems here where the script felt rushed and I wish it has more complexity inside the story. Now let's talk about the title of the movie so called ""Multiverse of Madness"" it's more like ""the madness of Scarlet Witch"" now there is Multiverse but it doesn't have any madness inside of it, the madness is actually the madness that Wanda created. Now here's the small problem that I had is that the dialogue felt off, the pacing in some scene can feel disjointed, some small cgi problem and if you're expecting to see some more Doctor Strange stuff you'll might be dissappointed because they show us the Scarlet Witch stuff more than the Doctor Strange stuff.

Verdict: Now I had a lot of problems with this film but I still think the movie was great. I love the weirdness, the goofiness that Sam Raimi did. The standout here was Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch I thought she did an excellent job, I love the arc that they gave it to her and this time Scarlet Witch looks so so so scary.

Score: 8.6/10."
Sam Raimis direction takes the sequel in a fun mania path to madness.,"5 out of 5 stars.

Doctor Strange into the multiverse of Madness is an awesome sequel. That has awesome stunning visual effects. Story that is unexpected. Great cast ensemble. Unexpected villain. And awesome action sequences. The cast did great. The visual effects are astounding. Story goes in a dark path. There are some cameos that i at least was not surprised. Which could have been better.

There is one mid credit scene that hints for the future direction. Which was great. Overall, i love the film."
Awesome movie,"This one of the most unique MCU films to date. I admit it I didn't have high hopes for it, probably that's why it suprised me so much it is really different from the generic marvel stuff."
A mess that worth your time!,"An evil creature is threatening the civilians and especially a mysterious teenage girl, that Steve used to have dreams about her in which they were fighting alongside against a creepy monster, their journey continues in the multiverse after asking Wong and Wanda for help to stop this threat.

Madness, madness and madness, they mean it in the title.

I've just seen a mess that I can't tell if it's a good one or not, but it's definitely a nice try. The multiverse idea is huge and Marvel is trying to give us more hints about it, they created principles in this movie about the multiverse and about how it actually works,and following these principles in the next films is a must.

At first, when I saw the trailer I had the impression that it's going to be an iconic marvel Movie, but it turns out that the story isn't that coherent, but it's still quite interesting and very amusing which is the most important thing about a superhero movie.

This film is missed opportunity especially for Elizabeth Olsen, after her wonderful performances in ""Wanda Vision"" , she was stunning in this movie, as Cumberbatch was either, these two are the main reason that made me feel what is happening on my screen.

It could have been more better more consistent, but it's still enough for me.

Visually it's one of Marvel's best."
Madness,"Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness, was a fantastic watch. Personally I was expecting it to be a bit better, but I did have high expectations for the film and maybe it let me down slightly but never the less it was still a gripping and fun watch for any marvel fan."
Worst of the worst,
Amazing film,
Good but needed more,"I won't go into a lot of details/spoilers here, so I'll keep it brief. The move is definitely enjoyable and also have a couple key appearances that excited the audience. That being said, I think trimming this movie down to under two hours was a mistake. The masses have shown they don't mind a 3-hour Marvel film, so let us have it. I think there was much more they could have done with the multiverse and the ending was a little lackluster. Like I said, it is enjoyable and I would watch it again. It just left me wanting more. Maybe that was the point? Maybe there are future plans for the multiverse that will keep audiences interested."
So much better after watching it a second time,
A Very Good Superhero Movie,"In Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, I praised the story, performances of Cumberbatch and Olsen, soundtrack, visual and sound effects, cinematography, action sequences, direction, screenplay, entertainment and production value, emotional weight, addition of horror and jump scares to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and how it sets up for sequels and future movies in the future.

Regarding the flaws, the only two things that I criticized in Doctor Strange 2 are the number of subplots and the weak connection to Spider-Man No Way Home.

But these flaws won't prevent me from saying that I liked Doctor Strange 2 a lot, and I'm looking forward to see what happens in the future of this character. So when it comes to the score, I give Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness 9 out of 10."
Better Then Expected,
"As a cinema , it's similar to magic 10/10","I watched this on IMAX 3d, so what i paid and what i saw on screen was just brilliant...it was worth every penny that i spent on it.

Now later on coming back home, if i think in little intellectual way then yes I may agree it was Wanda Maximoff in the multiverse and doctor strange was in it.

Doctor strange literally had no chance against Wanda.

But it was Directors and Marvels idea to go with the way they think...and what they thought and have put on an iMax screen isn't bad at all it's amazing, rather it isn't just a normal movie because , you get see such amazingly choreographed CGI, never seen before and visually magnificent.

So i have no complains at all. Such movies with huge fan base can never satisfy every fan. Avenger series was an acception.

I'm sure if i would have watched this on my laptop or tablet 1st time...impact wouldn't have been same as seeing a movie on an iMax screen. I am saying this as i see lot of movies on my tablet and laptop 😆😆"
A Mixed Bag,"Moments of fantastic Sam Raimi combined with hot steaming chunks of woke Disney garbage.

The script is a little slow getting off the ground, and the cameos and cross-overs add very little to the story.

But the final fight brings back great memories of older Sam Raimi flicks - the Army of Darkness and similar movies. Dark humor and comedic horror.

If only Disney could have kept their agenda out of this, it might have been a respectable addition to the Marvel canon. But overall a meh."
an amazing sam raimi original!,"Doctor strange in the multiverse of madness is a very thrilling movie that will have you at the edge of your seats. The acting is truly remarkable and the introduction of america chavez was written perfectly. Elizabeth as the scarlet witch totally stole the show with her crazy good performances and gave us her best work yet to the point where she as a villain outshined doctor strange. Strange went on a very exciting journey on this film and it was so much fun following him throughout the multiverse. I can't say too much about him without spoiling something so i will just say that if you missed stephen already you will be glad to have him back. This movie gave us a great introduction to the multiverse and got me extremely hyped for more. In terms of cameos, maybe lower your expectations a bit. Let's just say that i now understand what kevin feige meant when he said they they showed too much in the trailers! Unfortunately i also have to say that the movie felt very fast paced which is just so unnecessary. There was no reason for this movie to be the shortest phase 4 film so far. There was just one proper storyline, which was very will written and gripping to watch, but no other actual plots. I wish they would have given us sam raimi's original last cut instead. He did a phenomenal job! You could really tell that this was his movie, it is a raimi classic! The horror elements in the second half of the movie were exactly what i wanted them to be and more. They are unlike anything we have ever seen in the mcu so far. Same with the overall brutality that we got in certain scene (you will know exactly what i'm talking about once you've seen the movie). Overall, it's an amazingly well done movie that's far from perfection."
Madness of Wanda,"This movie is just amazing. The visuals of the movie is backbone of movie. Terrific visuals. Direction of Sam Raimi has rocked the screens and the execution of the movie is outstanding. Powerful performance by Elizabeth Olsen and her performance is the best among all , other actors has also done good acting. The film has many cameos like Professer X from X men and Captain Cartor and Rees Richards from Fantastic four and many more. This time story highlites 3 people Doctor Strange, Wanda and a new character America Chavez. America Chavez is a multiverse traveller and this time Wanda is the villain of the movie and in this movie we see her form of scarlet witch. It is a must watch movie and family friendly also but if you haven't watched Doctor Strange (2016) and the web series Wandavision it will be little difficult for you to understand movie."
Fairly to point but a nice addition to the MCU.,"I've watched every MCU film thus far. Some fare better than others. DSITMOM is a great middle of the pack MCU film that propels the characters into the next iteration of the Marvel Universe. It looks great, is fun and Sam Rami brings a nice horror flavor to this entry so it stands out a bit."
"Wow, just wow!","Just saw the movie and it was a crazy movie with great sound effects and digital cinematography. Just overall watching the movie was an experience (maybe it was the theatre I was in) but this a must see in the movie theatre.

Was not expecting watching a movie like this, very different from all the other Marvel movie franchises and definitely surprises watching the movies; must see!"
Magical 3d experience,"It does not have a appealing story with twist and turn, just a linear simple plot, most of the important scenes from the movie were already in the trailer. There were no jaw dropping action scenes but apart from that the 3d cinematic experience was really great..."
Pass on this one.,"Confusing, idiotic, and more interested in CGI than a solid story line. However, I have seen worse. But this is a slog fest reminiscent of a video game, not a great superhero movie. It's appalling that as of this writing it has a 7.1 rating. This is a solid 4."
"It was ok, The second half was the best part.","People rating this below 5 are actual dingbats. It was fun and entertaining, yeah it's all over the place but the title is literally multiverse of madness. Definitely not the worst of marvel movies, we have dark world for that. People who are rating this low probably loved endgame more than infinity war as well. Seriously buncha of complaining nincompoops. Your reviews aren't helpful, just mean and not constructive at all.

Is it perfect? No. Is it at least a rollercoaster of entertainment? Yes. See it or don't but I suggest you do and decide for yourself. Go in with the idea that it's a new phase in the MCU and you won't get to fawn and fall over your pretty boys. Sorry. But also not."
Marvel does comedy horror...,"The previous Dr. Strange film was really good but had the unfortunate timing of following a lot of Marvel origin films, making it feel samey. This follow up solves that problem by being absolutely nothing like any previous Marvel film, certainly in tone. Sam Raimi returns to Marvel to direct and his signature is absolutely all over this, with homages to films and characters from past projects galore. This film steps boldly into the comedy/horror genre that Raimi excels at, and my word does this film benefit from it, with genuine tension, jumpscares and some truly dark and twisted scenes that wouldn't be out of place in a horror film. To say any more would spoil it, but if you like the Evil Dead films and you like Marvel, this is an absolute no-brainer."
Burning trainwreck,"This movie is complete trash. Feminist, woke trash. Noisy, gory nonsense.

Dr. Strange a weak side character in his own movie.

I did not pay for this movie and still feel ripped off."
This was in fact Madness,
Before I even realized...,
Simply a bad story,
"Fun, but I have no idea what happened","The MCU is in a bit of a spiral, as one would expect after investing hugely in a massive series of inter-connecting stories that somehow manage to connect in a sensible way all the way to a satisfying conclusion. We are now several years past Endgame, and there is no indication that the MCU is going to be capable of pulling off that kind of massive storyline again.

In some ways, I'm ok with this. I've never been a comicbook fan, but my impression is that each comic is episodic and does not necessarily link to the rest in a way that would make sense. If the movies are going down that path, it only makes sense... though it also means it is easier for Disney to crank out stories to make money without making sure that there is a coherent universe. The MCU fits this style better than, say, Star Wars or Jurassic Park.

Back to Dr Strange. I really couldn't tell you what the plot was or what happened or how the characters grew. I enjoyed the spectacle, and I really enjoyed the horror elements Raimi brought to it. It felt darker and a bit more serious in tone than most other MCU films. Although I enjoyed it, I wouldn't say I would recommend it to anyone unless they just want to have a fun experience and switch their brain off.

Is it worth it? I watched it on Disney Plus. I'm glad I didn't spend money in a cinema to see it."
Another great Marvel Movie,As my title suggests another great marvel movie. Benedict Cumberbatch (Doctor strange) plays his multiple roles fantastically. And Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch) really shows her dark side. The special effects were fantastic can't wait to see what's next down the marvel pipeline.
Delivered on what the fans have been wanting!,"Great chaos and madness all around, well casted and great cameos and bringing back the Sam Raimi! Couldn't have asked for a better sequel! Scarlet Witch is here and don't mess with her! Perfect amount of speed and story telling and really don't have anything negative to say except for the waste of the second post credit scene so just watch the first post credit scene and you are good to go!"
An entertaining but ultimately failed mashup of two movies,
Good visuals and Scarlet Witch makes it mere average,"The movie relies on its visual effects to progress from beginning to end which is the main highlight of the whole movie. Good visuals have helped in covering majority of the drawbacks the script has created. Although the movie is not enjoyable as a whole it still has its moments including Gargantos fight,Strange V Strange and much more. Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet witch is the only acting performance worth praise, she has literally nailed her role.

The film however suffers from a lot of cons which pulls it back. Wastage of multiverse along with its potential characters is a cardinal sin and this one sadly is filled with it. Mediocre script, horror sequences and climax is another factor that reduces the whole impact of this flick. Good actors wasted is another hard thing to watch and the film at times relies too much on it for entertainment. Useless post credits is another disappointing factor of this event. Last but not the least the background score of the whole movie looks wasted except for Strange V Strange sequence.

In the end a hardly average MCU movie making it a forgettable one.

Rating:58/100."
Great concept - average execution,"I love the idea of this film. Dr Strange battling mythical beings and different versions of Marvel characters across multiple universes? I'm in! But sadly this to me almost felt slightly B grade.

The CGI personally I was not impressed with. Many moments I felt I was watching CGI that felt like it was made in the early 2010's.

The dialogue, which definitely attributed to the poor acting, was often painful at times. Very cringey lines delivered poorly by a multitude of characters. I almost can't blame the actors for trying, but the children in this movie, including the lead, were absolutely terrible, and I'm really not exaggerating here.

There were fun moments don't get me wrong, some good horror aspects, the enjoyment seeing the different characters in the multiple universes; but this wasn't enough to make up for the overall finish of the film.

Overall, some enjoyable moments and fun scenes; but some cheesy dialogue, poor CGI and some really bad performances."
Don't watch,
The Dumbing down of Superheros,
Exciting from beginning to end,"I thought the movie was great. Very exciting

Cameo with Bruce Campbell was funny. In the second half they seemed to slow down the story somewhat. Added a couple long drawn out fight scenes. But over all, great.

Rachel McAdams is a pretty woman, but she had a huge mole on the side of her face that I couldn't stop seeing. They kept the camera on the side where the mole was for the whole scene. You would think that it could be easily removed. For the rest of the movie her hair was down and you couldn't see it."
Multiverse of plotholes,"The cracks in the MCU are starting to notice more and more. I don't know what causes it, but the scripts are getting worse and worse in phase 4. It's inexplicable how a new superhero could be introduced in this film without explaining where her powers come from and with almost zero character development."
Benedict Cumberbatch fights Carrie and The Evil Dead,"Recipe for this film was simple. Take a bazillion dollars worth of insanely good special effects, and give it to a horror movie icon on a magic mushroom high. Nowhere near as endearing or self explanatory as most instalments in the MCU, this was just a wild ride of sight, sound and scares held together by a great cast and wicked CGI doing their best to overcome a weak script and ridiculous plot.

If you've ever had sex on a roller coaster and wondered what you should be cheering about more while simultaneously confused AF, you will really appreciate this movie. If not, it's still a great way to ingest some popcorn and check your brain at the door for 2 hours."
Keep it simple,Off late MCU movies are getting incredibly complex with plots that need advanced degrees in astrophysics to understand . They need to understand that most folks are just looking for 2 hours of enjoyment. Keep the plots simple will ya going forwards?
A nice movie,"An film extremely entertaining, enjoyable, full of interesting characters and spectacular action, with horror elements as well. Absolutely recommended."
Sam Raimi had to make a version of his Wandavision & what if!,This is more like madness of Wanda maximoff and Disney had to introduce a bunch of characters so they threw them in and turned on the blender. Whatever came out is whatever we got! The main plot of this movie has already been explored and well narrated by the Wandavision series but dragged on for 2 hours. Off late Disney has been running out of idea and we can see that very clearly with this and it's star wars endeavour. If my wallet was on the line for this I'd have felt violated for being tricked to walk into this cash grab attempt by Disney. Extremely dissatisfying movie.
It's was alright....ig,"This movie had no story only carried by cameos, it was shortest mcu film Yes it was entertaining film but what can you say mcu is just entertaining at this point a theme park ride with no story no plot no nothing.

Thing I liked about this film it was a horror film Sam Rami master of horror genre made a good flick and the acting was also good.

But come on marvel plz go back to story driven film like Instead of being lazy and using cameos as audience reaction."
Enjoyed it,"I mean, it's the MCU...honestly I rate them pretty much all the same. I love good food and fine restaurants, but sometimes I just want a Big Mac and fries. The MCU is the McDonald's of the movie world. Trying to pick it apart is silly. Wanda and Strange are good protagonists, it's fun, it looks great, and the multiverse lets them throw in all sorts of cameos, cross-overs and alternate versions of characters. Anybody who gives this less than a 6 is kidding themselves, and no amount of ""unhelpful' votes will convince me otherwise."
Idk what's going on,
"Enjoyable, if Somewhat Disappointing","The build up to this film's release was interesting. The trailers were great but once I heard that Sam Raimi was forced into 3+ months of reshoots, the runtime was only 2h and 6m and that the ending wasn't even written yet when filming started I was worried. Though it wasn't nearly as bad as some other comic-book films that have suffered from reshoots (i.e. Fan4stic, Suicide Squad, Justice League, etc) it was still obvious. Many plot points, characters and especially the first act felt very rushed. Which is most likely due to the original runtime being 2h and 43m. However my favorite aspect about the film was Sam Raimi's direction, even with the reshoots his style managed to come through well. In fact there are a lot horror elements which were very reminiscent of the Evil Dead Films. Benedict Cumberbatch remains great as the title character and Elizabeth Olsen is the best she's ever been as Scarlett Witch. Overall, Multiverse of Madness was entertaining but still was a little bit disappointing even with my expectations lowered due to what I had heard going in."
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madting,
I've enjoyed the mess!,"The actions were perfectly made but the script is weak and some super heroes were brought to embarrass themselves. America Chavez was always watching the actions , hoping to be saved. Was enjoyable as I watched 3d, otherwise could be boring."
"A Big, Dumb Mess","I had high expectations for this Doctor Strange sequel. Unfortunately, In the Multiverse of Madness failed to meet any of my expectations. It's big, colorful, and absolutely stupid. There's nothing in the movie that feels original. It takes concepts that were introduced in WandaVision, Loki, and Spider-Man No Way Home and does nothing to build upon them. The plot also relies too heavily on shock factor cameos that add nothing to the story. Cameos are fine, but they need to contribute to the plot in a meaningful way. Which they did not in this film. Sam Raimi, the director, who is most famous for directing the original Spider-Man trilogy, shows that he hasn't grown at all as a director since Spider-Man 3. This is essentially a Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movie starring Doctor Strange. It feels so off. The score is bad, the dialogue is at times cringe worthy, and surprisingly the CGI was very underwhelming. The story was rushed and at times felt outright dumb. Luckily, it's not all bad. As always, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda is amazing. She really carries the film. Her performance makes it worth the trip to the theater. Cumberbatch and Rachael McAdams are both good too. The action, while visually lacking at times (messy CGI), was still entertaining. I think my biggest problem with this film is that it bites off more than it can chew. It tries to be too many things. It has a lot of interesting ideas, but it's all too rushed and poorly put together. Raimi tried to add in horror elements, but it ended up being more laughable than scary, and not in the good way. It's just a mess, but an entertaining mess at that. It's not bad, but for the MCU it's definitely underwhelming. Ultimately I don't think Sam Raimi was up for the task. MCU fans will enjoy this film, but it is deeply flawed."
Very Fast Paced but Enjoyable,Honestly the only two parts of this movie that I really didn't like it was Benedict Cumberbatch's severe wig line and Rachel McAdam's chunky Austin Powers heels.
Apparently Disney is intent on ruining everything they touch,"The story is poorly put together and shoehorns in so much unnecessary moments. Everytime you think it can't get worse they found a way. Effects were ok, that was about it."
Wow!!!!!!,If you were hesitant on seeing this movie because of certain stuff you will see in this movie trust me you will regret not seeing it. This movie is amazing it's not everything it could have been but for what it is it's awesome exploring the multiverse was one of the coolest sequences I have ever seen. Sam rami knocked it out of the park with him being back in the director's chair.
Character development? What's that?,
a huge confusion,It is obvious that the film had extended reshoots and a change of script.. woth plot holes that make no sense e to appear on the first 5 minutes.. great scary directing though.. you can see how the director is a king on making horror films..
Very appropriate title,"Dr Strange comes to the aide of a young girl he recognises from a dream.

This is an enjoyable movie with a lot going on.

'The Multiverse of Madness' is a perfect title. The plot shifts in many surprising and random directions that for me involve some great ideas. I particularly liked the use of the character Wanda Maximoff, the cameos introduced via the multiverse, and the 'Evil Dead' direction used in the later scenes. Also it nicely lays more foundations for expansion (or should I say incursion) of the MCU into other franchises.

I think if you take superhero movies seriously you will have issues with the how random the plot is, but if you go along with certain concepts for the ride and take aspects such as the horror sequences, with a tongue in cheek spirit there is plenty to enjoy.

What makes it feel a bit bloated and rushed at times is the volume of action spectacle. It starts with a frenetic sequence and the pattern continues throughout with very little respite for characters (outside Wanda) to develop or connect with the audience. I felt it's length and found myself thinking ""Okay, another battle of superpowers, can we hurry this up?""

There is also a tiresome amount of exposition dialogue, presumably due to the plot being relatively more complex than your average mainstream popcorn flick and the amount of relevant content required to know from other movies and shows.

Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen are easily the standout performers, particularly Olsen who gives another star turn as Wanda. The supporting cast are all solid, especially Benedict Wong.

For me it is a 7.5/10, but I round upwards."
"15% Visual spectacle, 85% Complete nonsense","I was really excited for the concept of a Marvel Movie directed by Sam Raimi, I'm still waiting for that to happen eventually because this movie is not it. Raimi's creative vision is bogged down by Marvel's generic, formulaic, and derivative cinematography, resulting in a jarring clash of visuals that borderlines on mediocrity. The dreaded reshoots are very obvious as well, with scenes being interrupted by boring nothingness that add literally zero value to the plot but serves to push merchandise and get brownie points for including ""diversity"" that will undoubtedly get removed for the Chinese release of this film. The story and it's conflict rely on making established characters complete parodies of themselves, magic is used as a crutch to explain every moronic decision by the writing department, and the more Marvel studios tries to explain their own rules the more plot holes they make by having people who either haven't seen the previous material or simply don't care to adhere to their own established cannon. I'd say this movie is a joke, but jokes are at least funny. If you're reading this and somehow haven't seen the movie already, don't bother."
I'm in shock ANYONE liked this movie!,"I'll say it. This movie is a laughable mess! I worry for the state of our world by how many like this HORRIBLE movie. I'd be embarrassed to be any of the actors in this. Stupid writing, bad acting, random special effects. ""I got Adobe After Effects. Look at what I can do!"""
Dr Strange in the multiverse of nonsense,"Sorry but watching this film was almost as bad as watching 'the eternals'. It was like watching a film made by people that spend all day every day, staring at their smartphones, looking at social-mediocrity, completely detached from reality - and coming up with a film story that JUST ticks boxes about how to come up with a film story! But thinking it's great, because ... they think it's really, really great coming up with a film story that's really, really great ... 'blue-steel' ... What's going on Marvel?"
Starts where it ends solves no problems,"Not worth the time I spent to go and see it, 0/10. Literally nothing changes about anything in this movie completely pointless money grab. If I were you I'd make the decision to skip the movie and go see anything better."
What's with all these bad reviews?,
Watch wandavision first before you watch this movie.,"Should make it 3 hours to expanded the multiverse,2 hours is too short to know about other universe,but is fun,amazing and madness at same time. Maybe they cut too many scenes,more brutal and horror than other marvel movies."
Messy,
The worst Marvel movie yet - where's the fun?,"The problems with this movie for me are long, so I'll start with them and finish with the good.

it's an insult to Dr Strange. His character is continually taking a back seat in his own movie and spoiler spoiler spoiler - he doesn't even win the final battle
-the plot is horribly laid out- whenever there's an issue, there's just another spell that comes along out of nowhere they can solve it
the horror elements are just silly I know Sam Raimi isn't the most talented (a one trick pony) but come on
Scarlet Witch might be powerful, but she just sucks as a character - her motivations are not of the scale required for this kind of film - it's always selfishness, not some greater conquest
the bringing in of some great characters, including the first appearance of Reed Richards in a Marvel film is once again insulting.




The good? Benedict Cumberbatch is great, Wong is an awesome character, the visuals can be fantastic at times. That's it though.

I don't hold out much hope for the next Thor.20 years ago I wanted more comic book movies. I still want more but not at this quality. I think I'm done with Marvel just like Star Wars. Thanks Disney for... we'll not much."
A Journey Through The Multiverse,
One of the best marvel movies,"Certainly the most creative marvel movie thus far. Visually, this movie is so imaginative, I was wowed. Sometimes the special effects weren't great, but it was how they were used. Vibrant colours, interesting takes on alternate laws of physics. Obviously the work of a skilled director. I actually think this is Raimi's best movie as well. I'm not usually a fan of Marvel films, but this one is so different from the rest that it actually feels inspired. I was also a fan of WandaVision for this exact reason, the decision to do different things with the format, not just sticking to formula. Definitely watch this movie if you're a film veteran and tired of sameness, watch a skilled director put a Disney budget to put use!"
Just put Wanda in Izanami,
If only Disney didn't own Marvel,"I have to say that I love the whole combination between Doctor Strange and Wanda . This film is very unique because it gave us something that a marvel film hasn't given us before . Which is grief , you really feel Wanda's pain and how mentally tired she is. You really feel she's tired of pretending to be a superheroe . Another point is that I'm so happy this film took a darker and ""sinister"" tone. I just wish this film could have pushed a bit harder with the horror aspect. For example , instead of oil , blood or even make this film gorier. The only weakness I would say is that the cgi in some scenes was weak but this film can allow that since it's supposed to be a multi universe."
"Ladies & Gents, Sam Raimi is Back!","As the credits roll, the first thought that came to mind after seeing Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness, is how creative the MCU filmmakers really are. With 26 predecessors, the second Strange film remains almost original due to its dark and suspenseful undertones. The use of ominous music, dread drenched imagery and the unfiltered & ""gruesome"" outcomes, offers a new and unique experience which is something to behold. Don't get me wrong however, as this is still an MCU film therefore, you are in store for top of the class action and for me, this is where the film shines the brightest. Here, Magic is the name of the game and the film features ONE OF THE BEST visual effects & scores I have ever seen. The battle scenes and jumps across multiverses was captivating and immersive. What comes next is unpredictable and exciting, proof of unlimited creative juices from our filmmakers. That musical battle... WOW.

Another highlight of this film is how it uses the Multiverse concept. Fans are in store for an example of the crossover potential of this Multiverse, with characters from different universes, making an exhilarating appearance. We also see deeper & extensive implications of Multiverse-rending actions as new power players are introduced. Exciting stuff!

What didn't work for me, was the ending and the script. It seemed that no one knew how to end the film as it became more of the same (I did say almost original, right?). The dialogue also seemed cheesy at times so much so that tremendous acting from our leads, were not able to save these scenes.

Overall, Sam Raimi's first crack at an MCU film, was a resounding success. His signature brand of weird and horror brings much needed fresh ideas. There is definitely room for improvement but with truly amazing effects and immersive score, there is zero chance for viewers to get bored.

PS: My wife whispered sweet lines to me mid viewing. Thats how good some of the scenes are :)"
Lost the feel of the first movie and feels more like a Raimi tribute...,
huge dissapointment,
Great visuals ruined by the too many trailers and the crammed script,"Unfortunately, the film is not what I expected. There is only one problem that it carries and that is the storyline or the script. The film is too much, it is way too full of madness. The events are crammed in a random way which resulted in a bad script. So many characters and so many events all in a short runtime which is 2 h only. A film like that should've held a runtime of at least 2h 30m. I really liked how the film gets right into the story, since it doesn't need an introduction because the past Marvel Events/films are already an introduction like Wandavision, Infinity War, Endgame, and No Way Home. However, it still felt rushed, and I blame the script for that. By the time I got to the third act, my head was hurting as it couldn't receive additional information due to the crammed and rushed events the story had for 2 acts. I felt like I lost track of the story because it was moving too fast and it was a lot to take in as at times it felt heavy.

In addition, the trailers spoiled so many things. At this point, I don't want to watch future trailers of future Marvel films due to the too much information it gives. It would've been way better if that info were held until the release of the film as it would've been better as a surprise.

Benedict Cumberbatch returns once again as Doctor Steven Strange in a great performance as usual. Even tho he didn't present anything new in this film, he was still great. Loved how the film showed the improvement that Doctor Strange had and the lessons that he learned from the previous events in previous Marvel Films like No Way Home as the character development was obvious. For the past years, Marvel was hinting that Wanda is the strongest Avenger in which this film finally presented the powerful Wanda Maximoff in a way that was never seen before. We were able to see her in a new and unique way as her superpowers reached their full limit. For the first time, America Chavez is presented on screen and it was obvious that she was there just to support the story of the film which discusses the multiverse and that is relevant to her superpowers. Her appearance meant nothing other than supporting the story. I felt no empathy towards her even though the film discussed a bit about her past. But again, the script was weak and full of random events thrown there and that's it.

Once again, Sam Raimi returns to direct another Marvel film in which he presented something completely new and unique. Really enjoyed the horror aspect this film had in which it is obvious that Raimi's style is present. The great cinematography of Mathieson and the music of Danny Elfman help in delivering the horror aspect, especially in jumpscare scenes. The use of low angle shots as well as the different transitions from one scene to another like the fade transition/cross dissolve and the Iris which was used very well.

The Visual effects are very bad. At times you can tell that they are cheap and not well made like Steven Strange's ponytail hair or his suit-up scene where he was flying. It looked like it came out from a 60s film.

Overall, the film's only flaw is the script and the visual effects that for me matters so much which is why it lost a lot of points for it and therefore my rating is 7.5/10.

(Watched in IMAX theatre)"
Such A Waste,"As a Marvel Man, I'm bummed. Without question a huge disappointment. I don't blame Sam Raimi. He did the best he could given the script or lack thereof. It's not that they WASTED the Illuminati or that expectations were too high. It's the fact that NO character had any arc whatsoever. The movie is the definition of shallow and soulless. Nothing or no one has any depth. Even shifting it in to a Scarlet Witch centric movie felt one dimensional and completely unsatisfying. The saving grace is the visuals and ""trippy"" fight scenes. Despite some truly awful special effects at times (when a film is 75 CGI, I guess some scenes can't merit enough budget) the visuals carry the load. Besides being heartless, the contrivances and flat out dumb plot turns also hurt a great deal. The one new character introduced (America Chavez) typifies everything wrong with this misfire. She is a plot device that registers as nothing but a shallow and ridiculous shadow of an actual character. Again, no character arc at all but her turn happens in moronic fashion because of one line of dialogue. Somewhere in all this there was a good movie. Shame that what actually hit the screen wasn't it."
Too Much Madness,"I did not love or hate it. There were moments I enjoyed, such as the humor and some of the multi-verse scene shifts and the epic fights. What I didn't like was the Dr. Strange makeup, which consisted of heavy black hair dye with white streaks and a first scene that seemed incongruous with how you would want to begin a Marvel movie. It just hit a wrong note with me and was overly long."
Works better as an standalone sequel than an MCU installment,"As soon the trailer of Doctor Strange 2 dropped as a post credit scene to NWH, expections become to pile up like crazy in hopes for a chance to see the departed heroes of MCU in a different avatar in a different alternative universes. Nevertheless the movie walks in that way as you thought it would but it never meant for finding the endless possibilities of multiverse but it wanted to focus on a problem created in this universe and spread throughout the multiverse and doing something about it.

A grieving mother tearing apart the multiverse in hopes to get reunited with her children killing a lots of people in her wake and it's the responsibility of Strange to stop her - isn't some out of the world legendary innovative never seen before plot ,but what stands out is the Sam Raimi's distinctive signature horror elements infused in every suitable moment. Accompanied with great VFX, cinematography, music score, set pieces, perfomer of Cumberbatch and Olsen, this movie may not be the best MCU offering but it's a worthy sequel to Dr. Strange's legacy."
Best Franchise made the worst movie ever......,Big fan of marvel but now i think that i should have watched baby looney toons instead of this garbage...and also i paid $20 for this mental torture in cinema...must watch for psychos...
Neat effects... but still boring,"Well, lots of mindless action with characters who've generally been fairly intelligent in other movies. Naming a character America might be one of the stupidest decisions... yeah, I'm sure she's a comic book character, but it's sure distracting to hear people say ""America's in trouble,"" and garbage. The movie is not well structured and doesn't really establish stakes properly. Why do I care about America? I mean, a few dozen monks appear to die and the movie moves on pretty quick from that. I just really don't find America to be interesting or charismatic at all. I also don't really get why the Scarlet Witch and Dr Strange never really tried to come up with other solutions... like helping America to learn to use portals? The whole thing is just stupid excuses for action. At least Bruce Campbell is getting a paycheque for a Marvel movie cameo."
What a mess,"I'm glad I waited for this to be free on Disney+

This thing is such a mess. The CG is wonky, the Directing feels inconsistent, and the acting is robotic.

The America Chavez actress needs work. I'm sure she's a nice kid but she is constantly either over acting or awkwardly trying to act against special effects that are made in editing.

It is right up there with the 2nd Thor movie."
It is slightly less horrible then you might expect,"Before you even watch the movie, you know it will be woke. Because that is what they do nowadays. And of course it is.

The whole movie is basically Dr. Strange and Scarlett Witch battle each other through the multiverse. Because the witch wants to abduct some children in another Universe and raise them as her own.

Oh yeah and there is the quota teenage girl that has to show up in every superhero movie now for absolutly no reason. Of course she can not act, of course she is from a minority and of course she has totaly super super super powers for no reason whatsoever.

But the special effects are greate and Bencedrin Cucumber is a really good actor. So this two hours are not completly wasted.

Would i watch it again? No. Will i watch the next superhero movie? Sure. It's not like i am paying for it."
Really really bad,"I LOVED Doctor Strange - I watch it for noise when I am working - I've seen it countless times - so I couldn't wait for Dr Strange 2. Within the first 10 minutes, I was unimpressed and it just continued - This was NOT an MCU quality film. It almost seemed like they made it for young teens. Like I was watching Power Rangers. Meh CGI.....mediocre acting. So disappointed. I will not be rewatching this one. The lines written for the actors were just.....BAD."
Great movie,
Possibly my favorite MCU film,I would be lying if I said I was a huge MCU fan but I have seen all of the movies except a few which I have tried to watch and found unbearable. That said a few stick out to me and this one really does it. Prior to this I would have said my favorite was either Black Panther or the first Doctor Strange but for me the character growth and visuals of this movie something unique. This stands out to me as arguably the best and most unique filmmaking of the MCU. This movie feels like a true comic book movie and it feels like a Sam Raimi movie. To a point a would compare this to last year's suicide squad film where it just felt like and over the top comic film. Furthermore this felt like a riskier movie due to the more graphic scenes but also a more emotionally weighted. It has a villain who has a clear motive but is so obsessed with it that she is beyond reason and a hero who is empty on the inside. Throughout the film we see Strange realize that he cannot win by doing everything himself and that he has to rely on others. We see the question asked if he is happy and this is a great take on him has a hero something Disney has repeatedly neglected in their superhero movies while Logan and The Watchmen have already done this incredibly well.
Excellent beyond Excellent - finally hello Dr. Srange,
Horrible plot and boring...,
More Like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Sadness,"There are currently 23 MCU movies and this one by far was the worst I have ever seen. It seemed that they were rushed to make the movie and couldn't develop a good screen play. The multiverse is a great concept and Raimi struggle to use that to his advantage. There were many opportunities for the film to take the next step but instead took a step back and made the plot really predictable. Raimi tried to step away from the marvel formula and make a different movie but ultimately missed the mark and ended up going straight back to the typical Marvel delivery system. I'm summery this movie had the potential to be an all time great but instead this movie underperformed in every way possible. I suggest waiting till this movie goes to Disney plus, if that, if you plan on watching it."
"Sam Raimi, Guys! It's Sam Raimi!!!",
The multiverse like you have never seen it before,"Doctor strange in the Multiverse of Madness is an incredible film that just needs to be seen. Sam Raimi does a flawless job once again behind the camera. Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen were once again flawless at their roles. This in my opinion was better then No Way Home. I personally think this is the best movie in the MCU. I love how dark this movie was we need more dark MCU movies like this.

Parents this is an extremely dark and scary movie for little children. Yes it is a marvel, but it is not a light one at all cost. It is so good though.

Score 10/10."
"Fantastic visual effects, awesome magic.","Dr. Strange part 2 is actually fantastic. I don't know why some people have rated it negatively. It only needs some backstory you must know. You should watch what if?, dr strange part 1, little bit of wanda vision to joint all the points. It is actually quite interesting movie. I loved it. Only 2nd post credit scene would have been better."
"Directed by a genius, written by an idiot","If sam raimi had any say in the script, I'm sure this movie would have been solid gold. But Marvel decided to get a nobody to write the movie, so it wasn't nearly as good as it should have been. Sam Raimi directed the first 3 spiderman movies, the second one being the best spiderman movie ever made (just shut up, you know it's true), so obviously he knows what he's doing. This movie shows he was being leashed by the studio."
Digital effects run amok!,"This convoluted, special effects mess is a shameful example of what happens when a studio and its script writers have such a low opinion of it's audience that they think they are willing to just throw hard earned money at any movie with the name Marvel behind it.

This fascination with made up realities has got to stop.

This foolish. Incomprehensible storyline is both unbelievable , long and boring.

This is why going back to the theater and dropping $10+ has become a crap shoot that you will get a quality film from story tellers who aren't trying to rip you off.

The producers should be sued for malpractice!"
Excellent,I'm puzzled by the lukewarm reviews. I thought it was terrific. Definitely more intense than any prior marvel films. Some scenes will be scary for younger viewers. A huge improvement over The Eternals and I thought it was better than the last Spider-Man movie. I found the story of the multiverse very interesting. Added some new layers to the Octor Strange character. Really liked the new actress who plays America Chavez. Elizabeth Olsen was terrific in the first film that brings Scarlet Witch to a major role.
Ruined by Disney effect,
The problem,"Doctor Strange is forced to take a backseat in his own movie. And this movie shouldn't be so tied to Wanda Vision. And Sam Rami should've had more creative freedom. And cameos, we got it."
madness,
What. Just. Happened.,"This was a hot mess from start to finish. I'd have to be completely kidding myself if I were to convince myself that this movie was anything other than a waste of time. I've seen all the MCU movies and series. I was a big fan. Anymore it's about far out concepts (I guess saving Earth or even just our universe isn't enough), special effects that are cool but get to the point where they aren't adding any value, and pushing political agendas that they assume everyone is in board with or believe everyone should be in board with. I'm over it."
Where are all the good story writers?,"Visuals and special effects are well done, but without a good story it ruins the movie. Hollywood in general needs to get better script writers. Go over it again and again until it's refined and well done. Where are all the good story writers? This is the kind of script some 10 year old would come up with."
They're trying to be clever...,
Originality and Style Have Finally Returned Thanks to Rami,"Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was such a cool movie by one of my favorite directors, Sam Rami, who also directed the original Spider-Man trilogy with Tobey Maguire and several horror films. In a world where a lot of comic book movies feel the same, Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was a unique intense unexpected movie that definitely felt like Rami's vision with cool cameos and references to his Evil Dead films. Wish more comic book movies took creative risks like this movie did because it's so much more interesting, intense, and original. As an indie filmmaker, it's great to see a studio respect a director's vision without interfering too much. That's what we need more of to keep originality and art alive.

I can't fail to mention that the composer Danny Elfman also contributed to the intensity with his unique music. His music stands out from the usual MCU soundtracks due to, again, creative risks and originality. Just like with famous composers John Williams and Hanz Zimmer, there is a recognizable iconic theme to the music.

Above all Thank You Sam Rami for something that stands out while being a fun ride."
Disappointing...,"As a nearly 50 year Doctor Strange fan, I was disappointed. Kind of like coming down for Sunday breakfast and getting lukewarm mush... ***with sprinkles***.

The first one was good, with hints of great. This was definitely a step down, for me.

Hoping other's find in more enjoyable, because I'm still a Strange fan.

Maybe it's just me, but Disney seems to be increasingly turning absolutely everything into unappetizing glop."
BORING!,"Action a-plenty, dazzling effects -- but basically no plot, terrible dialog, and totally botched half-hearted attempts at humor. The longest 2 hours I've experienced in ages."
One star each for....,"Campbell, Wong, and McAdams. At least the ""movienachos"" were good, and the attendant found some jalapeños for me, too. I recommend getting the nachos and skipping the movie."
Worst thing I've seen in 2022,"Save your eyes and money is watching this movie please.

I'm sorry Stan Lee, we've lost everything.

1. Bad 2. Bad 3. Bad 4. Bad 5. Bad.

6. Bad 7. Bad 8. Bad 9. Bad 10. Bad."
A Very STRANGE (And Scary) Multiversal Sequel,
Madness on point,"I was very lucky to view this movie thanks to early release date in Malaysia. It contains some elements of gore which was surprising for me as this never happens in the previous Marvel movies. But overall it helps the story and the visual style of Raimi, which is just spectacular. There were also various scenes that was very surprising to watch as an audience and thus I recommend watching the movie in the big screen to truly experience the atmosphere. The acting by Benedict and Elizabeth are a masterpiece to witness. Their performance were very captivating. Overall, this movie really is a Raimi movie it has surprises and a thrilling experience."
"THE HORROR ELEMENTS WERE ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR. ""THE DARKHOLD EXACTS A HEAVY TOLL""🚦🌈",
Sam Raimi welcome back!,"""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" is a good superhero movie that goes out of the common line of Marvel to enter the horror genre. Sam Raimi makes a nice comeback as director. The cinematography is well done, the acting gets the job done, and the special effects are decent. A good superhero movie out of the ordinary."
I call it Buggiverse,"I think Marvel is out of ideas or rushed to just create movies and don't think about what is making.

I would be glad if someone answer my questions:
why spidermans from other universes was different but every other person has same face?


how spidermans just could travel trough a portal but others need power of America (the girl)?


why every universe is at exact same time? Are every earth created at same time? Absolutely no!






Really this is a very poor idea for creating multiverse."
I was prepared for the disappointment I felt.,"""If you want the girl, you'll have to go through me"". How a single line can sum up perfectly the sheer laziness and lack of independent thought that went into this movie. Vacuous, puddle-depth Disney at it again."
Missed the opportunity to be great.,
"Too Much Hype, A Lot Less Delivered...","Since Dr. Strange first entered the MCU, he has developed into one of the Prime Figures of the Universe. Tremendous hype was generated regarding this film but ultimately it partially delivered the madness & the multiverse. Starting with the positives, the visuals were really well done, all different forms of magic & different universes were meticulously created. Sam Raimi brought his horror genius into this one & gave this film its own distinct style. Instead of the mundane cinematography of most Marvel films, this one had really cool camera angles & Raimi's Zoom-Ins. Scarlet Witch is the Best part of this film, her devastating powers are at full display here & Elizabeth Olsen's highly emotional performance was the standout. The action setpieces are really creative & entertaining. But the biggest letdowns are the writing & editing. None of the dialogues make impact & are very generic, exposition like. The movie flies in rapid pace so there is not much space for breathing & character development. Even the little emotional moments we got, needed powerful dialogues for the scene to be elevated. Overall a pretty average film with moments of brilliance."
"Raimi Fun, But Botched Major Character Arc",
Not your usual Marvel movie - and not in a good way,"This movie felt very different from your regular Marvel movie. Not that movies shouldn't try to be different but this one felt like it just didn't..fit. Too much of an emphasis on the visuals (which were great) but not as much on the story line.

At times it felt like they were trying to fit as many surprises (Easter eggs?) into the movie without considering if it added anything to the storyline. The result - a weird amalgamation of characters without any real substance."
this is a sam raimi film.,"Absolutely phenomenal. The camera work, the music, the acting it's all great. Elizabeth Olsen is truly great, this is a must-see! The cameo's don't overshadow the actual plot and they don't take too much screen time, speaking of time the pace of this movie is so fast you'll be entertained the whole time!"
Maybe a bit too fast-paced for its lead character,"Early in the film, Sam Raimi creates a fun silver age Marvel vibe that mixes modern effects with a B-movie aesthetic. And on the whole, the film succeeds as a visual extravaganza. But for me, the film lacked an emotional core. Finding some human resonance in all the superhero shenanigans is the MCU's strong suit, usually. The film comes closest with Wanda's motivation, but this is Dr. Strange's story. While his deeper meaning is there in the script, it doesn't deliver an emotional punch -- at least, not one equal to all the magic punching that leads up to it."
The title is accurate,"5/10 - don't know if I loved it or hated it, all I know is I didn't understand a literal thing.

Some of the acting was great. Some was poor. Don't understand why this didn't fully lead off from the spider man movie.

Also not sure if this can even be fully called a doctor strange movie. It's more like Wanda Vs Strange.

Just very confused about it all tbh."
This movie wasn't bad,"Not a bad movie. It definitely had it's high points and had cool and unique fight scenes. However, it may have been doing a bit too much for its run time. No matter, it had me on the edge of my seat and I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
Focused on the Wrong Things and Copped-Out,
Mediocre MCU movie,"This is miles away from the previous Dr. Strange movies / which had somewhat intriguing characters and storylines. However, Disney are definitely running out of ideas, and this movie obviously had a deadline to meet. It's much darker than the previous MCU movies, but I didn't mind that as much.

What annoyed me was the lazy rehashing of old plot lines while injecting a ton of great CGI, and then calling it a day. They recycle the multiverse concept and resurrect Wanda's obsession with her kids from the Westfield series, and escalate it ten fold. Then threw in some random characters and (convenient) powers without much background.

It seems to me that these new found powers are more of a convenience to MCU, so Disney can churn out future movies by bringing anyone back from anytime - especially when they run out of original ideas again and are forced to rehash old plots/characters (as evident in this movie).

In summary, good watch if you are not looking for something new."
Wanda co-starring Dr. Strange,
Raimi delivers the dark goods with Cumberbatch back as Doc,"DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS (2022) *** Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Xochiti Gomez, Rachel McAdams, Patrick Stewart. (Cameo: Bruce Campbell) The MCU continues to explore alternate realities with this trippy, wild-ride action packed sci-fi mind bender with Cumberbatch back as the persnickity Doc out to protect newcomer America Chavez (Gomez) whose ability to propel herself into the aforementioned universes catches the eye of the grieving Wanda Maximoff, The Scarlett Witch (Olsen having a field day emotionally) hellbent in reuniting with her pre-conceived family. Filmmaker Sam Raimi returns to the studio full-fledgedly at his creative peak with some amazing visuals, impressive camera work by John Mathieson and also another welcome return to form in Danny Elfman's propulsive soundtrack. Darker and more sinister in tone (yes please) the film only wobbles in the at point overwrought theme of family matters. See it in IMAX - by all means for a true visual extravaganza."
"A crazy, mind bending movie. Bizarre, yet not rewarding.",
It's getting boring,Another typical Marvel movie with an angry little girl. It's not as disappointing like Hawkey (what a disaster) but still much much overrated. At least I could watch it in disney plus without paying extra anything.
Wanda in the Multiverse of Madness,"At the very end, you can see the skills of a Sam Raimi flash. The rest was probably screwed up by the management. The film actually looks as if three or four directors had worked on it. There were scenes, especially towards the end, where even the camera angles deviated significantly from the rest of the film. It probably could have been a good film if the director had been given free hand."
Can't help themselves,Disney just cannot get past or let go of trying to cram their woke trash down our throats. In a movie that was already so-so adding their splash of stupidity just tanked the whole movie. Glad I didn't pay to see this!
Crowd pleasing,"Doctor Strange 2 is a frenetic, nonsensical roller-coaster of a film. It provides plenty of fan-service, plenty of action and visual effects, but very little logic.

A trend in the more recent Marvel movies is how comic-booky the MCU is. In the first Avengers movie, aliens invaded New York through a sky portal and the city was like a war zone, with people acting accordingly. Now when people see a giant tentacular monster crashing through the city, they say ""awesome"" and get their phones out, assuming that some super-hero will deal with it. Maybe that is how it would actually be...

Maybe it is this sensibility that causes the movie to lack any real feeling of threat, of actual stakes. Even when characters die, there is no sense of shock or loss.

Having said all that, Dr Strange 2 is a comic-book movie, and maybe we should not expect more than that. In that sense, it delivers what is promises in great quantities and I would recommend it as a popcorn crowd pleaser."
Cool effect,"I give 8 out of 10 because another 2 poin killing by the storyline, to me the movie suitable to be released on Mothers Day. I just speechless when scarlet witch surender after meeting with the kids."
Not really a good sequel to the first movie,
Positive top mess.,"This is a movie to go to the cinema for. My excitement was huge and the trailer was also very good.

Benedict Cumberbatch returns in his signature role as Doctor Strange and shines in every way. Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff has a place in this part and her contribution is greater than previously thought. Other old acquaintances return and there is room for a couple of surprises, which one would certainly not have thought of. If you can call this part horror otherwise it was definitely the scariest Marvel movie. The CGI is most likely world class and one enjoys the various ideas that were shown.

In my opinion a very good Marvel movie and I really enjoyed it. Top rating from me for a brilliant performance of a spectacle."
A Fantastic Unique Comic Book Film,"After a long wait, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has finally come to cinemas and today and I have watched it and here is my review for what was my most anticipated film of 2022. The premise of the film sees after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home. Stephen Strange has to deal with more misgivings with the Multiverse that could lead to major ramifications.

Main Character Benedict Cumberbatch is once again back as Dr Stephen Strange and he is fantastic in the role. The film does a really good job of expanding his character, as in the recent team up films we haven't had a huge chance to do that. This film continues his character journey from the original film and Cumberbatch absolutely nails it.

Supporting Characters After WandaVision I truly realised just how great Elisabeth Olsen is as Wanda Maximoff and she shines here. Her character is given real shine here and her development is probably my favourite part of the film and I am glad it is given the time and justice for the character and actress. Benedict Wong gets more screen time as Wong and he is actually one of the most underrated characters in the MCU and I love the dynamic between him and Cumberbatch as they have developed into one of my favourite partnerships and this is the most we have seen of it. Xochitl Gomez plays America Chavez and she is a fun character, I don't really know anything about her character in the comics but she was a well fleshed out character here. Again the dynamic between her and Strange is well realised and feels like a friendship that we can care about. Rachel McAdams is back as Christine Palmer and she is better realised here then she was in the previous film and I liked how her character was used throughout the film.

Story The story is good, this film does plenty of good character work and the main characters progress nicely and it really helps with the plot. You understand where they are all coming from and how things progress feels fluid. But, this film doesn't hit all the points, there are things from the previous film that are seemingly ignored and I understand it couldn't quite fit here but I was disappointed that it was clearly ignored. Also one character's ending didn't quite work for me and I think it could have been handled a bit better.

Script The script is really good, the mix of humour and drama is really well realised. This film actually feels quite unique considering it is in the MCU but the writing is still really clever and it just suits this film.

Style The film looks amazing, he film doesn't jump all over the place with its aspect ratio this time which is great. The CGI looks amazing and the tone is so interesting. This is the closest the MCU will ever get to a horror film and these elements feel really unique to a Marvel film and that made it really stand out to me. It is actually paced really well, which I was a little worried about and despite a lot going on it manages to all link up well.

Overall Overall, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a fantastic film, you have to have watched the first Doctor Strange and WandaVision to truly appreciate it but this unique and entertaining film is definitely worth the watch.

Rating - 9/10."
Greatest marvel movie of all time,I'm every aspect multiverse of madness is visual candy mixed with a story which had many twist and turns characters are the stand out of this movie from Scarlet witch to Strange himself this is Sam Raimi at his absolute best.
This is not a Doctor Strange movie.,"It's a movie about Scarlet Witch and a brand new character (at least in the MCU), in which Strange has a secondary role, which would be great...in Spiderman. Or in any other MCU movie. Or in a movie called ""The Multiverse of Madness"". See my point?

Due to the multiple protagonists, the film tries to tell too many stories and ends up not telling enough of any of them."
Always the script,"I went to the theater to say goodbye to Doctor Strange. I found the story to a bit better than I thought it would be, with many scenes not convincing at all. Poor choices and so on, like many movies today. My decision? I seldom go watch movies in theaters nowadays."
Not much in the movie,Meh. Saw it today. Not much to like though. Story was bit predictable. CGI was awesome though. New superheroes were a bit of damp if you ask me. John Krasinski doesn't suit Reed Richards. And black bolt. So so boring.
Just great,"Let's start with the obvious. It is a Marvel movie. So, action, setting, effects, etc. Great. But the story on this one is very good too. The one thing I am not a fan of. You really should watch Wanda Vision show before seeing this. But if you have, it is a great watch with a compelling story. I have not watch any trailer before, so I can not say what was shown. But there are a few cameo that I was very happy to see, an evil dead joke that made me laugh a little too much and a lot of comics nods for the people that use to read them.

All in all, it is one of the good one."
Waste of a good cast on a sucky script,"I'm glad I didn't pay money at the theater for this dribble. Lots and lots of CGI eye candy, if you're into that. Man. I'm getting rid of Disney, sick of this pablum.

The most powerful witch in the multiverse gonna destroy it all for some phantom kids? Nice, de-value her by making her wanna have mommy urges. You sick m-effers. Disney cancelled."
Missed opportunity,"After you finish the movie you would realize why Scott Derrickson had creative differences with the producers. It could have been a great movie but they missed their chance.

Sam raimi tried to do his thing but it was let down by poor writing. After reading sam raimi's interview about this movie it just feels like he didn't try anything on his own. He just made what he got to enter in MCU and to make more MCU movies in future.

The movie doesn't even feel like a continuity to No way home and that movie came just 5 months ago.

The movie doesn't do any justice to it's title. There is multiverse but they didn't use it properly.

I was hoping the mad chaos in the last 45min of the movie but it wasn't there. There could have been so many things but they just played safe and it backfired.

People might like it for some of the cameos but it's not worth it.

There should have been fights and chaos between one universe to another and that's how they could have made it good but there is no good use of multiverse at all.

Even the ending is not so good. It just ends with few dialogues. I mean that's it. Why create so much just to end with 2 lines?

You would realize how good the first part was than this and how good Scott Derrickson would have been for this movie.

Marvel is just cash grabbing now as they know people will end up in theaters whatever they will make.

Till Endgame it was all good. Even NWH was watchable but remaining movies are not so good.

It's becoming repetitive now and it's not long we people who are watching these movies from 2008 might stop watching as that thrill is vanishing."
Give Wanda a Break,
Disappointing and not a family movie.,Not sure what I was watching. Felt like it was a Scarlet Witch movie featuring Doctor Strange. Lots of graphic carnage. Wasn't fun to watch. Not a typical MUC film and a far cry from the first film. Honestly bummed out right now. I'm feel like I was generous ingiving it a five.
A pretty standard Marvel movie,
In The Mouth Of Madness,"A mixed bag with some nice moments but ultimately a bit underwhelming. Sam Raimi provides some nice touches with more than a few nods to the Evil Dead series and Wanda is giving the chance to shine and be the all powerful that she is. Surprisingly i thought the movie was stronger before they travelled to the multiverse, once there the movie is a bit all over the place. The cameos were slightly disappointing, i thought The Suicide Squad doing the whole 'kill off the secondary superhero group thing' worked better. As a big Sam Raimi fan i am surprised this one left me cold but it just didn't do it for me, even the run time is fairly short and i was still clock watching. Here's hoping Thor & Taika Waititi can bring more to it in July."
"Great visuals, nothing else.","Plot, writing, pacing, even acting was pretty damn bad. The entire budget was spent on fancy animations and pointless cameos.

The entire movie is just a succession of flashy looking fight scenes that have 0 impact on an already weak plot line. This might actually top Captain Marvel as my no1 worst Marvel movie."
"Disappointing But Still Entertaining, Potential left to Spoil","I am tip toeing around spoilers to give a thorough review without spoiling it. This review contain theme spoilers WITHOUT specifics/details so if that will ruin the movie for you please skip.

If you are a fan of America Chavez and her origin arc I would be surprised if you liked this adaptation of her origin. It weakens her resilience and heroism from the little I know of her origin story. Sans some basic survival skills, she is a virtually helpless pawn for majority of the majority of the film. With some very easy plot tweaks that could have been corrected masterfully. Maybe with an underlying sage guidance ie ""your toughest opponent in life is yourself"" while trapped by the villain in the movie. Visually great but with the lazy plot and Saturday Morning Cartoon style solution (with some great acting by Elizabeth Olson Wanda/Scarlet Witch making it palatable) if you were expecting MCU greatness you will be disappointed. Compared to other movies I rated a 5 this one is better so if possible I would give it a 5.5."
Not so Bad Not so Good,"Marvel was trying so hard to make this movie works.

Also they been trying to make it reasonabl to the story of multi-verse, and that's is exactly the problem they've been trying too much until it doesn't work anymore. The magic has gone.

There is a lot of chaos in the movie which is probably way too long, Pull up from Spider-Man and now Doctor strange something is definitely not working for marvel although the box office."
That's not how it works...,
I think I like it?,
Spell-binding,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness provides a darker side to the MCU, which most fans will be thankful for, thanks to Sam Raimi, if you're not getting lost in the story, you would certainly get lost in Multi-verse jumping and spell-binding special effects."
Wandavision: The Movie,"The movie tells the story of Ms Wanda, a woman who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder due to the loss of her lover and her imaginary children. Unwilling to listen to her psychiatrist, Dr Strange, she went on a dark path to regain her happiness. Dr Strange himself is entangled in his dilemma as he has to go on that same path to save his client. Both of them in the end learnt that they need to let go of the past to move forward. But it comes with a heavy loss.

The End.

Oh yeah, there's another kid involved in the storyline, but, well, never mind.

Let us go watch the Disney + series instead. Yay!"
Nahhhh.,"Just skip this one people. Not worth it $$. Sad to say it. I was excepting more.

They should have change the name of the movie to ""whatever it takes to be with my kids"""
Sam Raimi on a leash.,"I'm a huge fan of Sam Raimi and was *really* excited to see this movie because I love Raimi's directorial style and from the trailers could tell that he was bringing some of his horror movie know-how to the MCU. Unfortunately, this movie just did not live up to my expectations at all.

First, let's start with the good stuff. The movie starts off with high action and energy and it basically never lets up - it's a rollercoaster from start to finish. The frenetic action and pacing works well given the story and Raimi really does get to inject some of his horror movie flair into the MCU, even though he is clearly held back by the Disney PG-13 leash, which unfortunately doesn't let him really let loose in a way that would truly elevate this movie - still, it's fine. I had a good time.

Now on to the bad stuff... the plot feels very rushed and some of the character work is mediocre at best. Some mild spoilers here (though nothing you wouldn't know already if you've watched the trailers) I went into this having watched Wandavision so the direction Wanda Maximoff takes isn't entirely out of left field for me, however, even with that context, it still felt rushed to me so I can't even imagine how it must feel for folks who haven't watched the Wandavision show (or even just interpreted the ending of that show differently than I did). This is sadly the direction the MCU seems to be going - where the Disney+ MCU shows are required viewing to understand the movies - and I can't say I'm thrilled about that. Sure, it can make for deeper looks into these characters and more nuanced exploration of the themes and ideas behind them, but it also runs the risk of becoming just too much for people to keep track of - this is the same issue Marvel faced with their comics many decades ago and I just hope I don't have to watch 50 hours of supplemental television shows to understand the plots of subsequent movies.

Another nitpick I have is the newly introduced character of America Chavez. I think Xochitl Gomez is good casting for this character and she seems to play the role just fine... however, she's barely given anything to do - her character is little more than the plot device / MacGuffin to keep the story moving forward and by the end of the movie I basically don't care about her because so little was done with her character to make me care. If she's going to be a major character moving forward I sure hope she gets something to do in future movies.

Overall I think this movie is a good time and competent enough to be entertaining, but it's definitely only mid-tier MCU at best."
I love it,
Multiverse of Mothereffing Madness,
more like multiverse of midness,Words can't explain how much i want my 11 dollars back. Not only was it a waste of 11 dollars BUT also a waste of my 2 hours. I should've just snuck into another movie smh.
Evil Book of Spells and a Deadite,
A MADNESS OF CLINGE,"A Blockbuster Madness Movie💥 The Movie Goes very deep Into the Multiverse Wanda Strange These two Hailed the Movie.

Blockbuster Visuals and BGM.

#Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness."
Multiverse!!!,"Liked: America Chavez. Nailed it with her casting!

Not so much: Some rough spots in cgi.

Loved: Wanda. The MVP of this movie!

This movie was amazing! It would've been even better had we not gone through the pandemic and it could've met it's first release date but we got it. It's absolutely bonkers! Incredible reactions to certain spots that I won't mention cos I don't want to spoil anything! Must watch it in IMAX or Dolby! That sound! Danny Elfman did a great job! Great Flick!"
SAM RAIMI,"The MCU phase 4 continues with Dr. Stranges second solo movie, Multiverse of Madness.

Multiverse of Madness is easily a top tier mcu movie for me. It's a astonishing, dark and a haunting movie filled with madness.

The story in Multiverse of Madness is really good and captivating. It has some very touching elements of family and love mixed with horror elements. Multiverse of Madness has a perfect balance between great superhero action sequences and sequences that gives you haunting Nightmares, which makes this movie feel like a horror movie.

Multiverse of Madness feels more like a Sam Raimi movie than it feels like a movie in the mcu. He has done what he does best with this movie, and i loved every second of it."
Multiverse of Messiness,
OK,It wasnt that bad but we expected more thats why everyone is mad. And as a main character we didnt see Dr strange as much as we wanted. It was too much madness.
"Different from the others, with excellent horror points! Simply: Sam Raimi!","There has been talk of the ""Marvel formula"" for a long time, where there is a lot of complaining about the films that seem to have always drawn the same line, only with different characters, here Marvel shows that it can do different! It was already speculated that this movie would be Marvel's first horror movie, after Sam Raimi (director of Evil Dead, Drag Me to Hell and the Spider-Man trilogy) was cast as director, this reality was even more realized.

Another point much criticized in recent works by Marvel are the visual effects, CGI and computer graphics; In this film, the budget was quite glorious and there is almost no problem with it. On the contrary, the different realities and different contexts of the film are very well represented by the visual effects, it's really beautiful!

The high points here: Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen, Dr. Strange and Wanda respectively; They're destroying your characters! Each with their own interests, each with their own stories! Simply impeccable! Also, the biggest highlight, as I said before: Sam Raimi! The ratings were pushed to the limit with him, they just made a Marvel horror movie!

We have an extremely agile film without ""wasting time"" on unnecessary subjects! In addition to the horror, which is extremely well punctuated, used well where it should be. It is concluded that it is a different film, it has personality, it escapes the formula and presents a lot of things for the next films, whether from Strange itself or from other films."
I am suprised... I liked it!,"I am suprised... I really liked it! I loved the fight between the two Stevens, the GCI looks good in this movie! The story is all in all good, the ending is very strong. Still, there is some plot convenience, show don't tell is not always followed and maybe there are not enough multiveres. However, I had a good time watching... long time since that happend with a marvel movie."
Very Different from Marvel,Fresh content..This time marvel gave us a horror touch superhero movie..when You watching this movie you will be notice the Sam Raimi's magic in every scene..
All this for a girl you met yesterday,
"A bit underwhelming, opportunity wasted",
Worst Marvel movie of all time,"The story itself already leaves much to be desired.

The Scarlet Witch needs a girl who can travel to different multiverses, so she can be with her kids in another universe. Lame.

At one point in the movie she's like ""I don't care if it's not my real kids."" - Umm then why bother anyways, she could've just adopted different ones and used some magic to make them look like hers.

The movie was so bad, it turned into a spoof of itself. At one point, they're literally fighting with musical notes and scores. I had to leave the theatre, because it was unbearable to watch. It's like they ran out of ideas and asked the cleaning woman or a random kid on the streets.

If there was a possibility to unwatch a movie and free some memory in your brain, I'd love to use it on this one."
Looks great!,"Looks great! And that's about it. If you are gonna make a wanda movie make one, don't shoehorn her in to another characters movie and then rely on the suspension of disbelief ENTIRELY. It just gets to a point where you might just be sitting there like I have no more suspension left to give."
they let sam rami do what he wanted,"This movie does dive right into the action, and is pretty fast paced. This movie does have some jump scares in it but it doesn't make you jump from your seat, but still you really won't see them coming. To be honest I liked this more than no way home because it didn't rely too much on fan service. The performance's from Benedict Cumberbatch, and Elizabeth Olsen are way better than before. There are also some gory scenes in this movie, and I am really glad that Disney didn't censor, and let Sam Rami do it how he wanted."
"It's Not Confusing, It's Not Convoluted. People Just Want Sameness.",
Multiversal magnificence!,"Just finished a late night screening in Oslo, Norway, and what an astounding movie experience this was! Easily top-5 MCU, paying off of all the years of character-development and world-building. With some great callbacks, while aldo establishing new avenues to pursue in movies and series to come.

Raimi did an excellent job, adding his own flair and a touch of horror-elements new to the MCU. All in all a truly terrific addition to Marvels multiverse!"
Multiverse of Disney washed...,"Let's start with the positives, as always the movie was as polished as any other Marvel movie with a ridiculously high budget.

The negatives, firstly it was drenched in P. C garbage, the lesbian parents (didn't need stating but just to throw that in with nothing) the Mexican new hero (again not an issue but so little was focused on her that there was no backstop, just a frail Mexican who didn't know her powers) the multiverse illuminati (got to have women and black alternatives in which they nerfed them completely (1st avenger!? And black captain Marvel!?) & of course the odd Tim Burton-esq sound in every scene.

The movie in other words was a mess...but not a good multiverse mess but in a virtual signalling mess in which they cast & then completely destroyed & weakened the alternatives. Very disappointing."
Let's get crazy...,"So, vintage Raimi meets the MCU. Absolutely loved it!

Only thing that could've made it better were more practical effects.

Wonderful use of subtleties to treat with the many guest appearances. Going in, I thought the movie needed to be longer based on what was expected but I was wrong; runtime was spot on.

Do I want another horror/fantasy for a Dr. Strange installment?... I think so.

It may not be everyone's cup of tea but if you enjoyed Raimi's early work and B-movie fare like Wizards of the Lost Kingdom et al from the 80s, then you'll really dig why this is the perfect treatment for Dr. Strange... this is simply what his comics were about.

The choice of antagonist was also perfect... added serious weight to the lore and, more than than, sets up for what could be the thing that breaks and recreates the MCU as we know it (if you follow the comics, you know what I'm talking about.)

Very enthusiastic 8.7/10."
Madness = FX platform,"Easily the worst film I have watched this year, without soul or point.

It served as a vehicle to display some impressive FX but the story's thin nd the constant bouncing from one place to another induced me to just stop trying to follow it in the end.

For me it exemplified the old adage; ""just because you can do a thing doesn't mean you should""."
Elizabeth Olsen carried the entire movie on her back,"An interesting approach for a Marvel movie - darker, scarier, and more complicated. There are some surprising cameos, but let's be honest, no movie can top Spider-Man NWH. Instead, make sure you watch Wandavision beforehand because Elizabeth Olsen SLAYED. Everyone talked about Doctor Strange and Christine but for me personally, Wanda is what makes this movie meaningful. Her strength, anger and sadness were all flawlessly delivered."
Marvel goes up it's own butt,"This movie was equal parts fun, frustrating, cringeworthy, ridiculous, and tonally inconsistent. If this is how Marvel movies continue, they'll immediately start going down the drain.

C-"
How bad can a Marvel movie get?,"Im not the biggest Marvel Universe fan, I admit. But that one- how did they convince Benedict to do it? Ill spare you the details and spoilers, but it felt like this- they made a movie before, had a big budget, spent 90% of it, and decided to do another one with the rest 10% but spent it all on visuals. NOTHING else, just visuals."
Yikes!!!,"This is by far the darkest MCU to date. I was not Impressed with the storyline and hate all The darkness. This could have gone another way.... do not recommend for children at all. It has a ""horror"" movie type theme. Bodies contort, people Get possessed, dark magic & witchcraft, demons, wraiths, violence ;("
Maybe not perfect but better than the usual crap,"Can't help but feel as though this films reviews suffer from expectations, it's not sweet and cuddly nor is it comfortable. It just has more grit and moments of ""yikes"", granted the story has a few slow and stupid points but it's a lot better than most of the single marvel outings, it's not for kids but it's also not well written enough for adults to fully enjoy.

I'm just happy to see Bruce Campbell."
qualified marvel movie,
The worst marvel movie yet,
"Stop it, now. Please.","I went off superhero films quite some time ago (maybe because I am an adult) but decided to watch this last night on Disney Plus. Oh how I regret it now!

All I can say is I would have had a much more productive 2+ hours if I were asleep. I had absolutely no idea what the hell was going on.

Marvel/Disney - please put a stop to this series of rubbish that you call MCU, before you get the whole world population turn against you! Enough is enough."
Very disappointing,"A gifted cast and innumerable colorful and spectacular special effects can't hide the fact a convoluted mess of a movie. This plot is completely lacking in tension, excitement or thrills. None of the characters are in any way sympathetic and I regret to say, things do not look promising for the longevity of the Dr Strange franchise. Perhaps Dr Strange has more value as a supporting character for other superheroes than he does as a stand alone character, at least as he has been used so far in the MCU. I am sad and surprised to say that even those this movie is just over two hours long, it seems much much longer. I was glad when it was over. Sorry, but I certainly can't recommend it."
In one word... mediocrity,"There were moments that spurred interest , but some scenes dragged out unnecessarily which culminated in an ending that felt rushed and underwhelming,

This multiverse also feels much less interesting than the one presented in the Loki series."
Not what you'd expect..still amazing,
Lost at start,"It took me a while to clue into the ""Wanda"" character background. I'd seen her in Avenger movies. But never associated her powers as magic and she being ""evil"" threw me off. There's no slow slide into the dark side with her, you're just presented with the evil witch to start. The movie felt very rushed and frankly some of the make-up done with Strange looked very amateurish. Not a bad movie, but a deeper background start would have been better. Worth a watch but most definitely not up to the standards of the Avenger movies."
A very solid MCU Film!,"""Just because someone stumbles and loses their way doesn't mean they're lost forever.""

'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' is the latest film in the MCU phase four. It sees the role reprisal of many MCU stars but most importantly sees the return to comic book films for legendary director Sam Raimi after 15 years since the release of 'Spider-Man 3' in 2007. This is the MCU's first in-depth dive into the Multiverse and it is definitely the most interesting part of this movie, with it setting up a very intriguing future in regard to this corner of the cinematic universe.

As mentioned this film saw the return of the legendary director Sam Raimi who helmed this project after previous director Scott Derrickson left due to 'creative differences' with the studio. This was the biggest film of his since the aforementioned 'Spider-Man' trilogy in the early 2000's. Now, anybody who is familiar with Raimi's great work will understand what I mean when I say that he has his 'style' and it is absolutely all over this film leading to him stamping his mark on the MCU. For those who don't know, the Sam Raimi style consists of a quite camp tone, which granted can become a bit too much at times but for me I think he regulates it here to the perfect amount, quick camera cuts and zooms all of which blend together to somewhat divulge from the 'Marvel formula' that has become a staple of these films. Something else that has become a mainstay in a Raimi property are the horror aspects of his work. This stems from his start with the incredibly popular 'Evil Dead' series of films. This is the first real MCU horror film and I think they bought in the right man to do the job, especially thanks to the campy aspects of the film linking nicely to the naturally comedic tone the rest of the MCU has.

As for the acting, it's solid throughout. Elizabeth Olsen is absolutely brilliant. She has always been very good in the role but this is by far her best performance as the character. They presented her as the main antagonist which was a smart idea that ultimately paid off. She has really believable motives that are even somewhat relatable and I can't wait to see what they do with her character moving forward. Rachel McAdams also returned from the first Doctor Strange film as 'Dr. Christine Palmer', despite her performance being sound first time round, she was completely wasted in the role. An actor of her calibre deserves a large part in a film like that and before this instalment I worried it would be the same the second time round and to my disarray I was proven correct. Her part is definitely increased this time but it still isn't enough for me to suddenly care about this character or anything that happens to her and disappointedly that lack of sentiment rolls over to her relationship with Stephen Strange. Something that has somewhat become a staple for the most recent MCU films is for them to have a certain amount of surprising cameos that can either service the plot or attempt to distract the viewer away from the poor writing, and for this movie I believe for the most part it is the former. Trust me, the writing isn't perfect but the key cameos are only on screen for a small amount of time so it doesn't end up taking away from the overall narrative.

One of the more inconsistent parts of the film are the effects. At times they're stunning, holding up to the usual MCU standard, however, elsewhere it looks poor to such an extent that it is distracting from the action happening within the sequence. I have to say though, the practical effects are brilliant and are something that relates to the aforementioned Raimi style and was very prominent in his 'Evil Dead' films. Some of the action sequences in this film are really innovative and genuinely nothing I've ever seen before. The best being the 'music fight' towards the end of the second act. It is a perfect blend of great effects, writing and suspense, it also acts as the perfect place to show off the brilliant work of famed composer, and frequent collaborator of Sam Raimi, Danny Elfman.

One problem with this film was that the marketing was all wrong. First things first, they showed way too much in the trailers. I mentioned the surprise cameos, nearly half of them were shown before the film even came out. That is ridiculous. What is the point of having the big surprise if we already know what's coming? It's a shame because it could've resulted in an even larger crowd reaction. Another mistake was making Doctor Strange the titular character. In my opinion this was clearly Scarlet Witch's story with Strange as a supporting role and it should've been marketed as her film. I'm not a massive fan of Doctor Strange as a character so personally I would've been more exited going into this if it was advertised as her picture.

Overall, this film is great. I have been quite negative near the end but all of the 'Raimi-ness' and a decent cast (carried by Elizabeth Olsen) lead to it being a very decent MCU movie. I'm much more interested in the future of other characters like Scarlet Witch and even Wong in comparison to Doctor Strange but either way I'll see what is next for the character and I hope that they bring back Sam Raimi if/when they do a Doctor Strange 3.

8/10."
The masterpiece of the multiverse,"Though Doctor Strange MOM almost lives up to the hype, it's still a wonderful movie to go and watch with your family but do be aware as it has some jumscares ( Sam Raimi Style ) with a good story, action and cinematography. I think i enjoyed myself with this movie along with its so called Villain where I clearly understood and supported the villain throughout the movie. It's a wonderful, gasping movie. Would definitely recommend it without a doubt."
One Of The Best Films Of The Year,"It is less Madness than i thought it's gonna be, but thankfully that's not really covering my pure joy, happiness, excitement, and great reception for me to the movie, it is a hell of a fun and depressing journey for the new MCU experiment film, bring Sam Raimi (a horror experience director and of course the original Spider-Man trilogy director) for Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness becoming a horror comic book PG-13 movie is a pretty smart and right decision because he nailed it at least for me, the horrorness of the film is really working well and it's my favorite thing on the movie, the sound, the cinematography, and of course the performances was great, i can get it if people not enjoying this one, it is pretty complicated if you are just watch this movie because it's a ""superhero movie"" not ""an MCU movie"" even that if you're not watching the MCU series like Wandavision and What If?, you will still get that type a thing, overall Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness is a fun depressing ride with many of exciting moments and fight, visually stunning, performly well, and simply better than the first one, as an MCU film, still not in the level of Endgame, Civil War, Thor: Ragnarok, and even No Way Home, but it's still one of the best, as a movie itself, it's also one of the best films of the year."
Season 2 of WandaVision?,"Felt like the Season 2 of WandaVision it certainly finished the WV story at least, One of the best marvel movies in a long time, The nod to the evil dead with the Bruce Campbell cameo was fun, Definitely worth a watch."
A strange compilation of loud scenes,"Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness (2022)

Directed by Sam Raimi

** / ****

As a movie on its own, this movie doesn't work. It is ridiculous. The movie is a loud, obnoxious piece of big budgeted Disney-Marvel entertainment; full of style, but no substance to keep everything going. It is a disappointment, considering the talent involved, particularly Sam Raimi, director of 'The Evil Dead' and the original Tobey Maguire 'Spider-Man' movies. He is a man of intense visual style, a filmmaker of great composure and interest - he's always been one of my favorite directors for it. Unfortunately, the movie is a massive disappointment, and what is most disappointing is that Sam Raimi was unable to hold himself together through the out of control story and unintelligible plot and Marvel mythology. It is ponderous, predictable, tedious, and sometimes even boring. It just goes on and on and on... it's like it almost never ends.

Where shall I start with the plot? I don't know, because I don't really know the plot. Here is what (I think) happened - I'll try to do my best. The movie follows Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) as he teams up with a teenage girl who he recognizes from his own dreams who can travel through Multiverses. Slowly, they fight threats to the Multiverse itself.

There are many flaws. The characters all act strange; Cumberbatch plays his character as a sort of one-dimensional hero, and many others feel like pieces of cardboard rather than likable characters. The story is completely off the wall; messy is a word to describe it; the movie just seems to be a bunch of random scenes put together by a screenplay that barely strings it all together. It's one of those movies you could turn on at any time, and still not know what was going on. The script is stupid and juvenile, and it is just not quite enough to keep me involved and interested.

There are many more flaws, but the only reason the film is receiving two stars instead of one is because of director Sam Raimi's undeniable stylistic impact. It is full of vibrant and visual color, complete with slick design. The palette of the movie's visuals are superb; the visuals stunning, and the cinematography breathtaking. But, unfortunately, it doesn't quite save the movie from the slow and unintelligible tempo.

In total, it's a massive disappointment, and must surely be among the MCU's worst."
Unbelievably bad,
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness Review,"Probably the most underrated MCU film in my opinion and one of the more underrated Sam Raimi films. This film is an absolute blast to watch. I was very skeptical beforehand about this being a cameo fest film and while there were some cameos, it was relegated to one section of the film and there weren't a lot of them. Plus they use those cameo characters in an interesting way. This isn't perfect by any means and the script is easily the weakest part of the film. The dialogue is definitely VERY rough around the edges and it definitely could have used another rewrite or two but oh my god the directing, performances, and characters are great. I really enjoyed seeing Doctor Strange's and Wanda's arcs in this film. Both coming to terms with what they have lost. I really loved that Wanda was the villain of the film. I really wanted WandaVision to go in that direction but it didn't and it seems that this film rectified that decision and saying what Wanda did in her show wasn't okay. It's safe to say here that all of the performances are great. Benedict Cumberbatch is still doing a great job as Strange and Elizabeth Olsen shines as Wanda but Xochitl Gomez shines as America Chavez. I hope we see more of her in the future. My absolute favorite aspect of this film is Sam Raimi's direction. It truly feels that Kevin Feige just told Sam Raimi to do whatever he wanted as long as he followed the script and my god did he deliver. Besides the first hour, this film is screaming that this is his film. The camera movements, the horror elements, and especially the gore. There was a surprising amount of violence in this film that I didn't expect to see from the MCU and it was definitely a welcome decision. I do believe though that this film would be so much better if the dialogue was ironed out more but this is so much fun that I can't hate on it too much. The second post credit scene is also one of my favorites in the MCU however it really only works if you've seen Raimi's other films. Definitely go check this out if you're an MCU fan and especially if you are a Raimi fan. You won't be disappointed."
True marvel,"A true marvel story, breath taking from begin to end! Only marvel can do that! Saw it in the cinema and was worth every second, even wished it would take longer!! 🙌"
"Good visuals and acting. Horrendous story, pace and direction","I went to see this movie with a very low expectation and the movie still managed to disappoint me and my wife. The dialogues were so disgustingly bad that, at times, it was an insult to my intellect and I almost yelled in the theater, and I'm just an average guy. Except for Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch, all the other characters are just a bunch of soulless and lifeless characters with no motivation or purpose to whatever is happening on screen.

The direction is horrible as well. Absolutely no conclusion for anyone, nobody freaking achieve any goals. No pacing, the scenes simply cut from one to another without linking them or giving any explanation for anything.

Stop spending all your budget with the CGI team and save some money to pay a proper screenwriter and have a plan about how the movie is going to play out. That's the first time I'll look to see who wrote this, to never watch a movie of this person again."
Elizabeth's back must be hurting,There was a lot of good stuff that I enjoyed in this movie. Kinda underwhelmed at some points but that's due to my high expectations. But man does Elizabeth Olsen shine in this movie.
Typical Marvel but direction not so,
Worst Marvel film of the decade,"This movie is a huge disappointment, I also fell asleep during the movie which usually does not happen to me. The plot does not make any sense and the movie feels like a sequence of random, overdramatic action scenes. I liked the first Dr. Strange movie but this one is not for me.

5/10 would not recommend."
Oh yes,"Which crazy movie with special breathless effects accompanied by incredible music and a totally exciting story (we do not see the time spent so we are in the movie), again a successful film of the Marvel Universe."
2nd best Marvel film,"I thoroughly enjoyed DSMM, even with its flaws.

The action was consistent, the pace and flow was excellent, the visuals incredible, and the acting was where it needed to be. From a technical aspect, this movie was almost flawless.

The conversion of Wanda to Scarlett Witch and the power calibration of Wanda/Scarlett Witch and Dr. Strange was viable and based on precedent. When Wanda is emotionally taxed, her destructive abilities come through. And no Avenger has been assaulted, emotionally, more than Wanda. You absolutely have to have seen WandaVision to understand this, as well as to understand the character motivation, but it all fits together nicely. And as far as her powers; we must remember, she went toe to toe with Thanos, one on one, and was on her way to beating him. And that was the more passive Wanda, not the Witch.

My gripes? Well, while Olsen does well here, she doesn't always 'get there' regarding her suffering from not being with her children. And there is some lack of originality in the drivers of DSMM. We've certainly seen much of DSMM before; the child prodigy, the desperate mother, the seduction of good based on emotional loss. After the first few beatdowns, I was even a bit afraid that we'd be heading into Dark Phoenix territory (and wouldn't a Scarlett Witch vs Dark Phoenix catfight be to die for), but Olsen's portrayal of the maternally driven Witch softened the boring invulnerability of what Turner brought to Phoenix. I would have appreciated a bit more build up to what tipped Wanda to the dark side (maybe some montage footage of her relationship with Vision, as well as her time with her brother), and I would have liked a bit more umpf! From Dr. Strange, who, at times, came across woefully weak vs the Witch.

But all that stuff gets washed away with a fun narrative, as well as some interesting cameos that gets me giddy with the Multi-Verse's potential.

If you are a Marvel fan, you will like this film. It's much better than what has stunk up the Marvel big screens post Endgame and pre-No Way Home (TV shows and Black Widow not included). Good to see Marvel back, and very good to see what is to come. I honestly can't wait.

9/10 - an excellent movie, straight out."
It's madness,
Doctor strange and the Mess of Madness,
ummm... she knows how procreation works?,"Could dr strange not tell her ""hey... u want ur boys? Ok open ur legs and take a hard one in""... problem solved... was no need for this 2 hours waste of time...

also... America Chavez? ... really? Whats next Abraham Putin? John F Jinping? ... why are we involving politics in superhero movies???

Just a disaster of a movie.."
Doctor strange : Existentialism,
Disappointment,
Lacks The Magic!,"Multiverse of Madness lacks the magic that made Dr. Strange #1 great.

The plot is messy and the motivation of the villain isn't great enough to justify the scale.

Still the movie has its moments to justify a watch. Far better than the last few Marvel flicks."
Beyond Terrible,
AMAZING,"I watched this movie in 3D & IMAX and WOW, I am just amazed how great it was.

I enjoyed every bit of this movie and even believe it is better than the first Dr. Strange.

It is the perfect length to: 1. Not get bored watching & 2. Leave you wanting more

9/10."
Strange indeed!,"It's gonna be very very difficult to top this spectacular of spectaculars. It's like LOTR on steroids and then some. I agree with reviewer, ridneyhemingway on 13 May, that it's beyond sinister that its seems currently trending to leave negative reviews and thumbs down on all great movies. Must be the prevailing depreciating darkness around the world now possessing each darkness from within their own darkholds to wreak havoc on all that is logical, just and sane, ala Putin and all similar chaos in military juntas. Let's hope these Wanda wannabes stay as just harmless irritating Karens and implode, vanquishing themselves in no time soon. Long live Doctor Strange. You heard me, now back off Karens!"
A very Sam Raimi film,"Not a bad movie. Just different. If you have seen any of Raimi's work, especially Evil Dead, you won't be surprised by the direction he took. I did enjoy watching it! I appreciated the homages and cameos to his other movies!"
Bad Movie,"The worst movie in the MCU.

The plot is so bad and screenplay is wired.

The most of scenes are filler.

Low post production.

America Chavez's story is cringey.

Good but better in theory,"This movie has some ideas that sound great when you think about them but execution here is not great. I really liked the new character America Chavez and Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda / Scarlet Witch is always perfect, but on the other hand the visual effects were really lacking. It's like whatever great this movie did there was something almost as equally not. Ultimately, I enjoyed the experience and am looking forward to see what's next for these characters."
Loved it,"Surprised to see so many low reviews on this one. I loved it. It definitely has Sam Raimi written all over it. A lot of drag me to hell vibes. It's much darker and violent than other marvel movies, so maybe it's not for everyone. I found it to be fun and so creative, a real visual treat. Like all Sam Raimi movies, it's not meant to be taken seriously all the time. There were so many unique visuals and fun scenes. I can't wait to watch it again!"
Bad movie,"The plot was horrible, the writers made Wanda the enemy. She deserved better! The writing was bad plus the way they portrayed. Professor Xavier like a live action cartoon was stupid. I was disappointed with the movie."
Fantasy scifi,The mix between fantasy and sci Fi has taken the marvel movies to the next level. Dr strange the first part was epic and I really enjoyed it but the second installment of the franchise didn't do justice to the powers that Stephen possesses and that's why this second installment is an oombiya padam for me.
Brutal,"Wanda's Show . MoM is not a usual Marvel movie . Sam Raimi returns to Marvel after 15 years , this time with his horror style of making , he delivered something unique . Movie hook you up right from the first scene itself . I expected they would explore more multiverse but the movie had only few . Wanda ( played by Elizabeth Olsen ) aka Scarlet Witch was impressive , this time they explored more of Scarlet Witch . Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange asusual gave us wonderful performance . Most of the cameos was already revealed on TV spots . Music could've been more better . Marvel again delivered a Visual treat , comparing NWH , this time VFX were well handled . Movie filled with many intense scenes with violence , if they had released the R Rated version then movie would've been more impressive . Overall again a well made multiversal adventure movie from Marvel.

A good weekend entertainer .

Before watching it you should've watched Wandavision series .

There is two post credit scenes .

They Got More Wong This Time!,"And that's no complaint. Benedict Wong's ""Wong"" is the best looking MCU character in its history.

But, that's not all the movie has to offer. It's a pretty darn good flick and so swiftly paced, those 122 minutes BREEZED by. I usually feel the SLOOOW moving films, so I was grateful for Sam Raimi's tight, incredibly good looking and practically CGI-flawless film.

I won't give the synopsis as far too many people spoiled this online already. But, suffice to say: if you're a fan of the MCU and its TV shows, you really need to see this. It's way better than the first Dr. Strange and it easily fits in my top ten MCU flicks as #8.

And speaking of spoilers, saying ""Okay, this isn't really a spoiler, but so-n-so shows up in this!!"" is very much the definition of spoiling the experience for others. So, when I saw this, I was virtually NEVER shocked when any character you wouldn't expect to show up appeared.

Luckily it didn't bother me too much and I did like the cameos. I liked all the actors - EVERYONE looked like they were having a blast and giving it their all. In fact, there's very little negative to say other than maybe it's even a little too weird for me. So, because of that, it probably won't get too many rewatches from me. Still, can't highly recommend this enough.

***

Final Thoughts: Never liked the Dr. Strange comics. Again, too weird. But, thank goodness for Benedict Cumberbatch, who is absolutely perfect for this role and he makes me a believer...in his 'craft."
Clunky...that's why it's great,
What's with the negativity,"I don't get it why people are criticising this movie. This movie was superb. A little out of the box and not your typical Marvel movie with kid friendly jokes but nonetheless this movie was freaking amazing.

The visuals were stunning to look at, the cinematography and the signature horror element of Sam raimi all were top notch.

I had low expectations for it after all the bad reviews but the movie blew me away.

It had a little pacing problem but as soon as the movie got going you just dive into it and it takes you into one heck of a ride.

This movie had a little problem here and there but which movie doesn't actually The tiny flaws didn't interrupt my enjoyment.

The only problem was that they revealed almost everything in tv spot. They should've kept everything hidden then everybody would've loved it.

Maybe most of the people were expecting 100 of cameos thats why they feel disappointed."
Expectations hurt,"Went wanting a lot.

Got tad tad bit ... The weakest point of the movie seems to be the title character .for a two hour flick it feels slouchy.the story starts of briskly... Too much of Disney wokeness kinda sinks this venture."
"Visually compelling, the rest kinda fell flat","I went into this movie expecting awesome things, and I can tell you I walked out feeling very differently. The visuals of this film were impeccable, and could be considered peak MARVEL visually. Another high was the acting, with Olsen and Cumberbatch carrying in that department and being one of the redeeming features of the film.

But despite this, it kinda fell short in every other department. Direction was a mess, the music didn't add much to any of the scenes and overall it just felt a bit corny and cartoonish at points. It felt like your typical Disney ""I can't control my power"" stereotype. Every 10 minutes there was always a question, and in the next 5 minutes it was answered, bringing the term exposition to a new level. It was brain dump of ideas with none being fully resolved, and heaps of wasted potential.

Overall, the film was a let down and as I left the theatre I was just disappointed. I still recommend watching it, to not only stay up to date but because it was still enjoyable, just wasn't anything spectacular, mediocre at best."
Most likely the weakest MCU film to date.,
Madness is to watch this so called movie,"I wonder , what kind of people give 7 and above to this stupidity . It's insult to average viewer intelligence. Probably the same ones give 5 to ""Deep water ""."
Refreshing Multiverse,"A refreshing movie for the UCM.

The scenes of tension, suspense and terror I loved, the terror mixed with superheroes seems to me something great and I can tell that Sam Raimi had a lot to do with it, although it is not a strong terror obviously. The scenery and photography in certain scenes are incredible along with the CGI, in each setting that transports us the script, and this new characterization of Wanda seems to me very good and to some extent creepy.

The bad thing about the movie is that it does not follow the same rhythm of tension and horror because the comedy is still present at all times until the end, it is something that, for me, does not help much to enjoy completely and even ends up being like any other regular but enjoyable movie within the UCM."
Hmm. Lost the feeling of original,As another review says-shiny and colourful. But the script is a waste of talent. Typical Marvel over the top and don't look too closely action. I actually felt sympathetic to the giant octopus. But really really boring. Come on Marvel. We want character driven stories.
Sam Raimi at his worst,
Smoke and Mirrors,"This entire movie is one big illusion, a magic trick that illusionist would be proud of.

Visually it gives you everything you can want from a movie, because it had the budget to give you that. And it's here that the entire movie sits on.

If you are expecting an elaborate, well thought, intriguing and gratifying experience, then you'll be disappointed. This movie barely has a story as it is.

The entire movie is carried by Benedict Cumberbatch with some assistance from Elisabeth Olsen. But mostly it's Cumberbatch that has to carry most of the load.

This movie will try to make it seem like Dr Strange and Scarlet Witch are characters driven by the same goals, but it will fail. Miserably fail.

At no point if you're sane can you even begin to see Strange and Scarlet as being characters driven by the same goals.

Strange in Infinity War he made a decision not just for all of humanity, but the entire universe. Sacrificing himself in the end. While Scarlet Witch goal is only one... Herself.

Scarlet Witch doesn't seem to grasp the simple concept of asking for help, or when she's completely in the wrong. When you finish watching the movie you're going to realize that the entire movie didn't need to happen at all, had Wanda just asked for Strange help in the first place.

This is a story about a multiverse with supposedly an infinite number of universes in it. What Wanda wants was simply in one of them or several of them, and she could've got it without any fuss or need to kill anyone.

But no. Typical Marvel movies nowadays, they need to overcomplicate simple matters.

Also Strange is always making gullible mistakes that he never did before. It almost felt like the Dr Strange that we're watching is not the one from the previous movies, but another from some other universe with a similar enough timeline.

But the worst thing this movie does, that is just unforgivable is that it leads you nowhere.

America Chavez... Unless you're a comic book reader you're not going to learn anything significant about her, even though she's the main target.

Wanda and how she wraps up things, it feels like Elizabeth Olsen was just done with the character and wanted to move to other things.

Strange... He mostly ends how he began. He learned a few things that might come in handy, but only if he's not this gullible in future movies.

And that's just unforgivable because this movie could've been so much more. Set up so many things to happen. But in the end it feels like one big 360° journey back to the starting line.

It simply lacks what to me makes a movie be a movie... A story.

And that's where the magic trick is. It gives you the illusion of a story, but what you think is a story ends up being just a mesh of ideas put together to get some money out of your wallet."
The show was definitely messy... But i Really enjoyed it.,"I dare say this risky opinion: Since Avengers Infinity War this is the best Marvel movie made.

It definitely does have some nasty issues (especially with power creep) and is messy at parts, but it's not a soyboy activist story of ""lets hit all possibile diversity quotas, yaaaay!"" Which in my book already elevates it by quite a bit.

There's alot of Dr Strange and his magic. Humor is toned down, but IMO not dull. Also we get alot of actual multiverse stuff, so that's also nice. Lastly, even though this movie is PG13, it definitely does not feel like it (seriously).

If you like Sam Raimis works: it'll be great.

If you felt like latest Marvel shows/movies were ideolo drill pointed at your head and you hated that: MoM will feel like breath of fresh air after leaving californian bus full oh so progressive activists.

Lastly, when i went to watch MoM i had a trailer about certain blue coloured nature hippies and they weren't smurfs, I can tell you that for certain. So, even though i'm usually keeping my hype train on full stop, this time i gently left my hand off the brakes. It's not related to MoM. Just wanted to mention that. Happy!"
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Horror Madness!,"Oh my god!!! Sam Raimi has delivered one of the best MCU action horror superhero movie ever made, that the whole entire fans got what they wanted! The action, the horror, the chaos, and the whole entire Madness of the Multiverse. After 20 years sense Spider-Man (2002), Sam Raimi brings a new delivery of surprising cameos, impressive Jumpscares, and the Evil Dead vibes filled with humor and horror elements. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness brought a whole new generation of Marvel masterpiece! Benedict Cumberbatch is great as he usually is and Elizabeth Olsen steals the whole show and Xochitl Gomez nailed the best character of the MCU! Now this movie deserves to be in the cinemas and also deserves to be delivered one of the best superhero Halloween movie to celebrate!"
"Raimi, Not Marvel","Kinda horrorish, but not too bad. Just make sure you watch it with the lens of a Raimi horror movie, not a Marvel movie. It has such a different feel from movies like Avengers and Thor that you'll be disappointed if you try and watch it with the same lens. Overall, a pretty good movie."
Are you happy? I am NOT,
Just nearly lives up to the hype,"I was expecting surprises. This movie delivered. And Sam Raimi brings all the tone, energy and craft his fans have come to love and expect. Cumberbatch has opportunities to flex his versatility, but the chops on greatest display come from Olsen. She has consistently been an impressive actor throughout her career and has been, fortunately, able to bring more and more of that skill to her performance as Wanda with each subsequent outing. This film is (currently) the crescendo of those performances. She steals the show. It's a wild ride that really takes off in the final act with every talent involved firing on all cylinders to bring us to a truly exhilarating and satisfying conclusion.

Spoiler alert: I have not actually seen this movie."
"Uniquely directed, terribly written","Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was a movie I was fairly excited gor. The trailer looked pretty hood, and it being helmed by Sam Raimi was an obvious pull, but I was unfortunately disappointed. The premise is flawed right from the beginning. The story mostly focusses around Wanda or Scarlett Witch after the events of Wandavision, immediately meaning if you haven't seen the show, your investment in the movie is severely lower than people who have seen it. The character of America Chavez is more of a plot device than a character. Right from the first scene with Wanda we can see just how little interest the writers have in exploring the complex morality of Wanda's actions when Steven tells her it was absolutely fine for her to enslave a village full of people because she fixed it in the end. Wanda does a lot of insanely over the top things in the beginning of the film that just feel out of character, like they are trying to hard to force her into a villain role, but this is explained with the boring old fantasy trope that she was 'corrupted' by *insert dark magic object*. This does lead to some really cool Sam Raimi horror scenes that make the movie fun to watch, but ultimately lacking in substance. Steven is sidelined in his own movie, and although they try to give him some character, they seem very confused as to where they want to take his character, which leads to a character arc that feels very vague and confused. The magical powers of the characters are explored in some very fun ways throughout the film, but the actual multiverse mentioned in the title is hardly explored, despite the massive potential with such a cool concept. There is one very brief sequence that shows a few cool universes, but it is very disappointing and far too short. Wanda's character arc is very weak and uncompelling since the writers show no interest in delving into the possible complexity of her character, so she ends up coming off as 2 dimensional. If you are looking for a movie with cool visuals and that iconic Sam Raimi style I'm sure you will enjoy this movie, but if you want a good story I advise you look elsewhere."
LOVED IT!!,"I know a lot of people who are complaining about the screen time given to Scarlette Witch... but really, Dr. S needs someone to fight, right? Should we just throw in a dolphin and a few seals or the baddest witch on the planet?

We've seen the power Wanda can wield, I think she was the perfect foe (or is she a fren-emey??) Who knows... I'll never tell - you'll have to go see it for yourself!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND SEEING THIS! Dr. Strange is my all time favorite 'superhero'..."
A kind of movie that you haven't discover in the mcu yet.,
This is truly unremarkable,I absolutely loved Dr. Strange (2016) until this cheap thrill came along. I'm pretty disappointed by the story created by the worn out Marvel machine. Please don't waste your time on this.
I Got To Say This.,
Need a Director's Cut,"Originally heard that the runtime for this movie was slated at nearly three hours. This version felt rushed, confusing, and the dialogue was just terrible.

Positives: Sweet action scenes, fan pleasing cameos, new character introduction, horror elements executed very well

Negatives: basically everything else.

Wait to stream on Disney Plus - not worth the money and effort to see in theaters."
Still not sure about this one,"While I watched this movie, I found it interesting. But since watching it, I've found I like it less and less. I really didn't like that the trailer was misleading. I didn't like that they made Dr Strange look and act more cartoony. I wasn't impressed with the character or actor of the new girl. I absolutely hated what they turned the Scarlett Witch into (or what they did with Wanda). I felt the musical fight scene was reminiscent of the bad parts of Fantasia. I was intrigued by the Multiverse but Spiderman did it better. The other universes could have been explored so much more or better than they were. And my God, please don't let Charlize Theron join the MCU. I'm going back and forth between a 4 and 5. So disappointing because the first Dr Strange movie is my top 3 MCU movie."
"Rough around the edges, but very fun and campy.","It is always lovely to go into a movie and expecting everything formulaic the MCU has every done, and be pleasantly surprised at the originality and campy-ness of everything happening. I must say that I am so very tired of Marvel movies that are good in principle, but boring and same-y in execution. And Multiverse Of Madness is certainly original, and all part thanks to Sam Raimi, who makes his return to super hero direction all the more impactful and memorable. Don't skip this one, if anything you will have a good time watching it."
Giving it 10/10 counter DC fanboy's 1/10. Movie is a solid 8-8.5,"It was pretty good! A lot was covered in the 2 hours. It almost felt like a horror movie at some instances. Amazing acting by Elizabeth and Benedict. Absolutely phenomenal graphics. Having watched Agents of SHIELD really helped! I really like what they're doing to the character of Scarlet Witch. I admit it was rushed. There could have been a lot more to what they did during the whole runtime but over all pretty cool and unpredictable. Hope to see more of the multiverse in future marvel projects. Also, this should go without saying, but you'll need to watch wandavision to understand it."
This is how you ruin a character,"The first doctor strange was something new and refreshing, the character was awesome and the plot too, and it's story led to more for the upcoming movies that came after it.

With the second movie, things are completely different.

My favorite spiderman was the one made by sam raimi, and when I saw that he also made this movie, I said to myself that I must see it. But boi was I deceived.

Most people say this movie is dark, I think horrendous is the most appropriate term of description.

The only good thing about this movie in my opinion are the 3d effects, other than that absolutely nothing.

The plot is average at best and the film makers presume that you already seen wandavision.

Without spoiling stuff (not that its much to spoil), I would cut to the chase: this movie is basically a horrendous big advertisment to black magic, spiritism and all sorts of horrible dark magic stuff that someone can think of. Basically the whole movie is like that.. The first doctor strange was light, funny, reasonable plot and the story led to something more, but stay away from this one."
Dr. Strange?,"Well, he sure was a stranger. For a movie named after the ""Main"" character, he sure felt like a side character in his own movie.

He was easily beaten at every single fight scene, and showed none of the superior powers he's been possessing in the previous films.

This one felt more like a Scarlet Witch and America something (Didn't even catch her last name) movie than a Doctor Strange flick.

The only positive thing I can say about the movie was the reveal that John Krasinski might be playing Reed Richards, and that the visuals were pretty good.

They missed a great opportunity with the lack of camoes in the multiverse, and somewhere in another universe, there is a better film than this.

I was just as entertained watching Venom 2. But I didn't excpect much from that movie. But this one was just a huge letdown."
Doctor mid,"Everything was expected just another fan's service & cash cow movie nothing more or less, common Disney and mcu we are not in 2000 anymore give us real movies."
Colorful entertaining and disappointing,"Disney wanted something entertaining that checked certain bullets was full of visual and action. But the plot moved so fast that it left no time for Dr Strange to be a compelling character in his own movie.

At least in the first movie he has actual struggles which he had come to grips with in order to learn magic. In this movie....does he even have an arc? There is a character ( I won't say who) who actually has a plot that is the only compelling part of the movie.

Disney you have multi-universal canvas to paint any story you want. This is disappointing and sub-pat at best. If this is what you have to offer Disney will end up killing interest in its own products, with little ,substance underdeveloped generic main characters ....but at least it had lots of afireworks.

Get better writers with guts!!"
Garbage,"The worst marvel movie I've ever been thru! What an awful acting job from everyone! Crappy directing,music didn't work...will never watch another marvel movie!"
Ruined Wanda and MCU!,"What a horrible movie, terrible disappointment! I'm so upset. And this totally ruined my favorite Marvel hero, Scarlet Witch / Wanda Maximoff. I just can't believe this got released the way it is. I loved Dr. Strange and I was so excited for this but wow, it was really bad. Terrible writing, even the casting disappointed me. Maybe because I couldn't take the Third Sister seriously as Captain marvel. She did awesome as the Third Sister in Obi! Why cast her in this movie. And Jack Ryan, it just wasn't believable. And all the horror, why?? The horror was so unnecessary. Total waste of time and I have no desire to see the next one now."
I really don't understand the poor reviews.,"As a huge fan of both the comics and the MCU storyline, I don't understand the dissappointment I see in some of the reviews here.

It had everything to make almost everyone happy. Huge scale in terms of conflict, new characters, Sam Raimi horror / cheesy goodness, multiple references to the MCU and to some of the classic and new comics.

It just felt so good to finally see Strange do what he does best, damage control dimensional catastrophes.

I loved the movie, some scenes were absolutely mind bending, and some of the ideas used in fights were awesome.

I don't know. I guess at that point if you're a fan of the MCU, you'll love it. If you're not and you're expectations are on the Shawshank Redemption level of cinema, don't bother watching and reviewing MCU movies."
The Worst Marvel Movie I Have Watched,"No story, no character development, lost of use less special effects. The trailer was better than the movie.

The worst marvel movie I have seen.

After a fabulous phase one ending with infinity war the rest of the movies (other than Spiderman man movies) in this phase are garbage."
Great CG!,"The CG & makeup in this movie are awesome! Some of the costumes are very well created. However, the storyline isn't that unique. Multi-universe idea has been seen in other movies already. Almost at the end of the movie.... a few super heroes came out & all got killed? What a waste of those good casts. I guess there is never an ending for Marvel movies."
Felt like a parody,"The plot is very basic and rushed, the CGI is overused and sometimes looks off.

There is almost zero character development for any of the characters.

The only thing that made the movie enjoyable was watching it in 4DX."
"Good, surprisingly UNCLEAN fun","Marvel movies. They're not a ""you love them or you hate them"" kind of deal. In fact, it's the opposite - they're tailor made to be as broadly appealing and instantly gratifying as possible (not a criticism, somebody's got to do it, why not superhero movies) and this is no exception but it's also one of those rare entries in the franchise where the creative lead has been allowed to shrug off, in small doses, their restraints and let loose.

Everyone knows Marvel shines brightest when it does this, both on the screen and on the page. As for the silver screen, your James Gunn movies, Taika Waititi, and now your Sam Raimi entries are where the weirdness that endears us is given the driver's seat and you end up with a guaranteed good time at the movies.

For 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' Feige has given Sam Raimi space to do what Avi Arad stupidly would not, to make a Sam Raimi movie. A kinetic, wild ride with boundless energy and a sense of fun.

The script is pretty poor, cringe inducing in places but it's not what you're here for and it's not what I'm here for either. Fact is, Marvel Comics properties exist in a world where traveling through dimensions is facilitated by a pug the size of a hippopotamus named Lockjaw so if you're here looking for insight then you really must be an idiot. As a creator, the whole breadth of human imagination is your toy in these bombastic comic-book worlds so why not just have some fun with it and get weird? This mission statement is perfect for Sam Raimi, who started his career as a trend bucking maverick, a true punk rocker of a film director, tragically wasted later on as a studio director, making diluted studio movies, perhaps from an unfounded lack of trust in his ability to stay with the brief. It's ironic that a franchise known for towing the lines of mediocrity and mass appeal has given him the chance to just be who he is. And thank God.

In summary, it's the most Sam Raimi movie I've seen since Army of Darkness, he's used all his trademarks, and a few more tricks here and there that he's picked up from being reined in by Hollywood. It's visually stunning in several places, really stunning. There's some horror that lands firmly on its feet in Raimi's hands, and is adapted gracefully to suit this franchise's previous and evolving tone. There's plenty of high action fantasy that strides along with glossy, irresistible confidence. The jokes all land, and they're not (unlike some other Marvel movies) egregious. Bruce Campbell is in it and he punches himself in the face. Give Raimi more of these movies. It's wonderful to see him back in control and better than ever. Worth the price of admission, and worth a rewatch or two."
DisappointIngly woke,"As always, the new norm is rubbing wokeness in your face, sacrificing movie quality. Chavez is wearing a rainbow on her chest and has two moms. Apart from that, the acting was cheesy and fight scenes were weak. It's really sad seeing how top notch Marvel movies had become during the infinity saga. They're regressing with each production. Story was entertaining on screen but poorly written. This won't be a movie that my kids watch nor will I watch again."
"Welcome back, SAM RAIMI!","Spider-Man: No Way Home pressed our nostalgia button so hard that we became dumba*s and started to expect that same fan service again!

Stop watching fan theories videos on YT and unnecessarily getting hyped about crazy cameos and other kinds of stuff. Adjust your expectations based on official trailers and TV Spots, not on random Reddit posts or Youtubers!

Btw, keep an eye out; otherwise, you'll miss Sam Raimi's cameo! And avoid the second post-credit scene if you're too sensitive or not a fan of practical jokes.

From me: 7.5/10."
Her Stupid Motivation,
Worst MCU movie till now,"I have never seen something as cringe as this movie. The dialogue, the effects (third eye), the rush, the lack of backstory, 0 character development, the overwhelmingly forced progressive elements pushed forward just to check a list. It seemed like the movie was more focused on the progressive agenda than on the plot, and it did that badly. If you really want to make people engaged, you have to make people emotional. If you want to promote minorities, you should make people fall for the characters that are a part of that comunity. Give context. Until Marvel comes up with something as spectacular as the last Spider-Man, I won't pay a cinema ticket for an MCU movie again. It is a complete trash. I felt bad for the actors that are way above the level for this garbage they had to be a part of. I had such high hopes from Marvel."
Where did you come from,"I seen both of the doctor strange movies and they were just brilliant in the way of special effects, actually these movies and the the matrix movies are just mind blowing."
Not worth it,
Face Your Fears,
Wait for the Disney+ release.,
*** SPOILERS *** Good Installment but Same Old Filler...,
Whoever saying this movie isn't worth it you must not have understood it!!!,I just lovvveeeed this movie man..I mean I have always loved the idea of other universes and stuff..and what was people expecting bigger than this huh? If you don't like it just leave it don't say anything bad about it..let people watch it..
What were they thinking? Were they thinking?,Can't believe I was hyped up for this abomination. Benedict Cumberbatch should stop continuing this franchise. It is a waste of his talent. Marvel is bringing down it's quality by just trying better their previous movies. Martin Scorsese and Denis Villanueve were right about their take on Marvel.
Doctor who?,"I was a bit whelmed. I wasn't blown away yet was excited to some thrilling, suspenseful, edgy action from the movie Wanda The Multiverse of .... I meant Doctor Strange, The Multiverse of Madness.

Let me tell you, a lot is going on; for those that haven't been paying attention to Marvel this past year, you may have missed out on some of the characters and the what if's that came true, no pun intended.

No spoilers but Doctor Strange had the spotlight stolen from him by the Scarlet Witch and a new character introduced to us. That took away from the appeal of who we came to see.

Additionally, the raw power displayed was beautifully executed. Unfortunately, Spider-Man No Way Home was a hard act to follow. Yet any other elements tied to Doctor Strange's arc weren't correctly managed and flat-out thrown at us at the very end. As I mentioned, I saw character development from other characters, which took the focus off of the main protagonist. As a fan of Marvel, it is really cool to see characters that were introduced to us from Disney Plus ( get your subscription, Disney should pay me for the promo). It takes away from the enjoyment in the sense of Doctor Strange being a phenomenal supporting character in other marvel films but couldn't shine bright in his own.

Nevertheless, the action is beautiful and vibrant, dark and edgy... is this Marvel? There were some jump scares... I mean, who wouldn't be afraid of The Scarlet Witch. You're in for a couple of surprises, all of which I don't believe the film capitalized on. They flirted with the shocks, and the casual fan may have missed some of the reveals, especially introducing new characters."
Awesome!!!,
The Multiverse of midness,"I think the quote "" expect disappointment and you'll never be disappointed"" was a message from marvel to us regarding this movie. The pacing was the worst and most horrendous thing i have ever seen in a marvel movie. The fact that they had a multiverse (infinite universes) but zero plot twists in shocked me , the story and plot were just bang average and expected. And then you get to the mid and post credit scenes, which are nothing short of utter disappointment. All in all one of my worst mcu experiences considering the hype that was built up for the movie.

Ps: The post credit scene is not worth staying for."
Maybe if they change the whole story this could be better,"A doctor Strange movie that isn't about doctor Strange, weird plots and more weirder villain, honestly they can do way better than this.this movie doesn't Lead to anything upcoming ."
The movie was about who again?,
Please stop using this writer,"This movie reminded me of another complete bomb in the Marvel universe - Loki. It was beyond disappointing and lacked any depth of characters. Put simply it was neither created nor clever and more of a mishmash of special effects and a complete lack of story.

What's even scarier is to think that the same writer has been hired to now ruin the Star Wars franchise. Somebody in charge needs to understand that we're not all mindless sheep and want there to be some level of depth with the storyline and characters. That's what attracted us to the Marvel universe in the first place."
"Great in visuals, lacking in substance",
Great movie but...,
Too much in your face...no plot,"It's the new thing...action from start to finish with barely a breath between scenes and practically no plot. This seems to be what movie makers think we want? Yes, it is more like the gaming experience..except that gamers can stop the game, use the loo and grab a snack. You can give your brain a break and process all of the high end action of a game. Not so with a film...nearly 2 hours of simply non-stop high action, violence and special effects gave me a headache and all the while, I kept looking for the plot. No plot, no emotional investment in the film...no emotional tie in...no reason to be there. I left before the end. I love the actors, it was great to see all of them again...but the story line was non-existent and I don't really care how it ends...there will be a sequel."
Dr. Strange and the Multimillion Dollar Dud,
"Messy, disconnected and lacking a narrative","First off: I am an MCU fan. Well I was until Disney went mental with connecting TV shows, movies and cartoons.

And in Multiverse they skip any character work and just run with the multiverse concept as the base for the narrative. And it's just not enough.

The last couple of movies has made me hesitant to watch any upcoming Marvel movies and this latest mess might just have sent me over the edge... into Madness.

Sorry Kev, you lost your touch :-/"
Boring Wandavision final episode!,"Again there's nothing new in another boring MCU movie, highly anticipated but fails to deliver. More importantly this one feels like a final episode for Wandavision rather than Doctor Strange 2!. MCU guys needs to wake up and gives us something really new... right now it's so repetitive!."
Forget the fan boy criticism,"This one is a prime example why you should run the other way when you see overwhelming positive reviews and go see the movie when you see angry little fans jabbing at the movie.

This was a marvelous movie, with awesome graphics and cgi, great pacing, great acting and real stakes.

You get a villain that shows its vast amount of power. You see that there are consequences when you face him.

You get introduced to new stuff and new mechanics.

The marvel movies past Avengers were geared towards a younger audience and I loooooooved that this one is more mature and with high stakes. It is nothing that

People just want to complain when they don't get exactly what they want. They complain for the 20 seconds that the 2 moms of America show up. They complain because their favorite character got kicked in the ass.

They even say this needed more multicerse when in reality this was happening throughout the freaking multiverse constantly.

Great movie, it won't traumatized your kids or any other nonsense you hear. Grownups can enjoy a marvel movie. Finally."
A winner all the way from Benedict Cumberbatch & Sam Raimi !!!,"Movie review: Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness #sanjuzzreviews #marvelcinematicuniverse #DrStrangeInTheMultiverseOfMadness

Sam Raimi once again returns to the Marvel fold to direct this film. In this film, we join Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) shortly after the events of Spiderman ,No Way Home as he encounters a mysterious traveller ""America Chavez"" (an excellent Xochitl Gomez) who has reached our version of Earth after being chased across Multiverse's by a mysterious unknown entity. Strange, alongside the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong (Benedict Wong) embark on a journey across the known & unknown Universe's to uncover the truth. Who is America Chavez? What power does she hold and Why is she being relentlessly chased by the entity is what the film is all about .

The film can be confusing for the uninitiated as it has references to previous Marvel movies.

However, the fast paced narrative , awesome VFX & fantastic BGM make it a memorable experience overall.

The combination of Raimi and Cumberbatch has given us a winner for sure. Kudos to the entire team for this visual treat for kids and adults alike . Watch it in theatres only.

3.5/5 from me for this one ...adios 🙂"
Politically Correct,"Sad to watch Dr. Strange to recognize that Marvel and Disney has sold their rights to political extremes. The movie was a mess with multiple plots that never were fulfilled.

Secondly, the movie wanted to check all the boxes with gender, sexuality, and race baiting.

Recommend to pass on this movie to save yourself the money and time."
Outstanding,"Superb entertainment, perfectly timed and put together. Bravo Sam Raimi and the huge team that put this together!

And a special word about the CG - artistic, dynamic, exquisite! For a movie that's practically entirely greenscreen, the visual offering on display is just gorgeous."
MCU's direction in jeopardy,This movie had zero impact on the overarching story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It felt like a random movie plopped into the middle of the universe. Hardly any use of the multiverse. When the multiverse was used it was not done well. Not The worst but definitely close to the bottom.
The amusement park is closed...indefinitely.,"Martin Scorsese may be secretly pleased. Not for so many gifted, even generational actors starring in bad movies. Not for directors or producers failing to create movies that generate billions of dollars in receipts.

More so, the glimmer on the gold is fading...rapidly.

Character development has been replaced by split second exposition. Nostalgia is lost on the uninitiated. Ultimately, I don't care what happens next in a tediously drawn out Schrodinger's theory.

I tapped out with 40 minutes to go. I could not be deterred from doing laundry to pay more attention to this film. Unlike Iron Man, which I wrongly thought no one could care about and despite the previous Doctor Strange film, I could care less about whatever phase this or any others to follow do.

Shang Chi was great. Black Widow, Spiderman: No Way Home and this are not.

The rides are broken, but management will take your money gladly.

The next Thor will be my last ticket."
[7.3] A Non-Doctor Strange Fan Rating,"This is my rating as a person who just watched Doctor Strange for the first time.

So, the movie was interesting and it grabbed my attention quickly. I loved the action scenes and the non-stop insanity. But I quickly came to realisation that this movie lacks in something.

Perhaps it lacks in characters. We see a total of 4 characters and some random ones who die the moment they step in front of Wanda. In addition to that, the movie lacks in... multiverses. Other worlds. I'd really love to see this movie with less action and more exploring.

Another problem is that the villain is more likeable than the good guys. I love Wanda. She's by far the strongest of them all and still she has emotion and she can feel pain.

Generally it is a good movie and it's worth watching especially in cinemas. The sound quality and CGI are god-tier."
Tough to rate,"Fantastic visual scenes stitched together as they bounce around the multiverse. There's not much depth in the story. I never really cared about the characters as they didn't have much development. You pretty much know the end so you aren't invested much there either. It's a multiverse so of course there were a bunch of other characters we know from other movies, but the movie didn't do anything. If this is the new Marvel I think they've moved from must watch blockbuster to sometimes entertaining franchise. Didn't hate it, but I'm a big Marvel fan and hate to see the decline. My teenagers loved it."
Seriously Marvel?,"I mean c'mon, after all that long we are waiting for this movie, we didn't deserve this. Only to introduce American Chavez and her power with stoping scarlet witch, that's all. A movie is made only for this basis. I utterly disappointed 😞."
What If Strange Supreme Episodes > Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness,
Blows its 2016 predecessor out of the water!,
It's ok but keep expectations low,"Honestly, I thought the film was just ok. Very special effect heavy and music a little more than needed at times. Horror elements were increased but not surprising with Sam back in the director seat. I guess the movie was fun enough but the useless throw away two mom scene was put in just right in a way Marvel can cut it for China and other countries with the rest of the film referring to them as only ""parents"" so not to offend other countries.

Overall, popcorn fun but not near as good as Spider-Man and does not too the first Doctor strange film. I give it a 7 but I'm rounding up a little as I thought overall directing was impressive."
Sam Raimi why?,
Total weirdness .. leading to sleepiness,"The director mixed up bits of Terminator, Horror, Indian black magic, The Mummy, etc. (Thank GOD , i did not see this movie in cinema & opted to see TOP GUN instead) . I practically wanted to sleep after half an hour of this movie, It was that boring. I just wanted the movie to come to an end. (There are those movies which you enjoy watching and wish it keeps on going). Somebody mentioned to me that star power really matters. Marvels have lost all of their super stars & now are banking on what ??"
Stop comparing this to Spiderman: No Way Home,"Every person whining that this'll never live up to expectations of spiderman can stuff it. Let it be it's own movie and let this movie be an incredibly cool mashup of 80s horror, adventure and dark comedy. They're not comparable, ignore the reviews citing this fact as the main reason they didn't enjoy this movie.

It's a dark and necessary tone step for the Dr. Strange series, especially considering the end credits. Could I have used some more multiverse madness? Sure. Did I enjoy how brutal and fast-paced some scenes were? Most definitely. Were some lines cheesy? In typical Sam Raimi fashion yes 100%. But this movie breaks the Marvel mold! And for that I'm so happy."
Absolute trash. Do not bother,It literally has great cinematography shots and that's about it. Story and performances are utter garbage. This is not worth watching. Skip. I'll just say out loud that this was a huge disappointment.
Don't watch it with sky high expectations.,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness continues with the adventures of Doctor Stephen Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch) after the events of Doctor Strange(2016), Avengers: Infinity War(2018), Avengers: Endgame(2019) & Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021). Doctor Strange joins forces with America Chavez(Xochitl Gomez), who can travel across universes, to battle several threats within the multiverse. They also ask Wanda Maximoff(Elizabeth Olsen) & Wong(Benedict Wong) to help them out.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is an awe-inspiring film. Director Sam Raimi has successfully taken over directorial duties from Doctor Strange(2016) director, Scott Derrickson. This definitely feels like the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first horror movie. I also got the feeling that this is a Sam Raimi film, with all the homages to his iconic Evil Dead franchise. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The humor is on point, like it always is with Marvel. I had unrealistically high expectations for this movie, after Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021). First & foremost, this is primarily a Doctor Strange(2016) sequel & a follow-up to WandaVision(2021). There are quite a few memorable cameos but, don't expect anyone & everyone to show up. Also, some crucial cliffhangers from Doctor Strange's previous adventures don't get resolved, which is quite frustrating. Benedict Cumberbatch is spectacular as Doctor Stephen Strange. Elizabeth Olsen is outstanding as Wanda Maximoff/The Scarlet Witch. Cumberbatch & Olsen's unforgettable performances, are the highlight of the film. Chiwetel Ejiofor is great as Baron Mordo. Benedict Wong is amazing as Wong. Xochitl Gomez is perfect as America Chavez. Rachel McAdams is brilliant as Dr. Christine Palmer. The supporting cast is awesome. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans. Go, have a blast!"
Not as good as the first movie and No Way Home!!!,
Sam Raimi takes a script by Michael Waldron and creates an eye-popping masterpiece that combines horror and fantasy.,
Love letter to 80s horror fans but not for everyone.,"It's clear why Feige tapped Raimi to direct this film. In many ways it shares more in common with slasher films of the late 70s and early 80s than recent superhero films. In the process, Raimi feels more himself in this movie than he has since Evil Dead II. However, much like those slasher films, it's not for everyone.

Without getting into spoilers, the villain in this movie shares more in common with slasher-movie villains like Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, or Jason Voorhees than other Marvel villains like the Malthusian Thanos or the misguided wannabe freedom fighter Killmonger. In this movie, the villain is an unstoppable killing machine imbued with supernatural power who will stop at nothing to achieve vaery personal goals. You can map the characters surprisingly easily to the original Halloween with the villain being Michael Myers, Strange as Dr. Loomis and the secondary protagonist as Laurie Strode with the villain obsessed with targeting the Strode character while Strange's Dr. Loomis tries plays the role of protector. However, unlike the simplistic villains created by Wes Craven and John Carpenter, this villain has an extra layer or two of character complexity.

This time around Strange shares his story with a secondary protaganist and narrative surrogate in America Chavez. Chavez serves as a bit of a human MacGuffin but is also a reflection of Strange's own insecurity and self-doubt that Strange struggles with in the wake of the decisions he made in Endgame and the sacrifices along the way. Various multiversal iterations of Strange repeat the mantra ""there is/was no other way"" in a manner that seems to be as much to reassure himself as it is to the characters that he is trying to convince.

All three of the major characters struggle with dark aspects of their own personality (somewhat unsublty represented by the alternate versions of Strange shown in the trailer) but in the end it's the culmination of Strange's arc and his ability to overcome his major shortcoming - his inability to let anyone else ""hold the knife"" - that catalyzes the same overcoming of personal demons in each of the other major characters. So despite some other characters having larger roles in the resolution of the story, it's still primarily Strange's story as the others largely serve as mirrors to Strange's personal struggle.

The execution is a bit uneven and definitely could be better, but the core human story arc for each of the three characters is strong. Plenty of amateur film critics will complain about possible plot holes like ""why did so-and-so do this"" to which MCU superfans will have some kind response relying on deep lore, but ultimately many of those criticisms are more ambiguous rather than blatant.

The main criticism is that this is ultimately a movie for a niche audience of horror fans. It is peppered with cinematic callbacks to 80s horror and slasher films including a variety of ""Raimi-isms"" that will have fans jumping out of their seats (including the obligatory Bruce Campbell cameo). However, people who haven't watched the Evil Dead film series multiple times are likely to get quite as much out of it. So if you're an MCU fan, Raimi fan, or horror film fan, you will probably like it. If you aren't a fan of any of those, it might not be for you."
Not accurate to the title,
Boring..no story lineup,"Only animation..nothing else..boring action ..and multiverse not describe well..so become boring..😴 and character of America not too good ,weakk ..don't waste of time."
So excessive it became diffiicult to watch,"I understand that Marvel has done everything on the superhero spectrum, right down to Thanos throwing an entire planet at Iron Man. Dr. Strange has stayed with me since his epic debut, but this had me lost.

Okay so the action and special effects were on point as usual. But thats really all I can say here. I mean I felt as if Doctor Strange was only there to explain everything, there wasn't any time for his classic mannerisms or further development. I mean he barely acknowledged his past, if at all! Just mumbo jumbo about different universes. The music was great and it had a horror vibe to it to top off the decently violent imagery. For real, there are parts that could have earned it an R rating. But thats no reason to hide this from your kids- your kids won't understand this movie anyway.

It brings me disappointment, I never wanted to leave a Marvel movie so badly. Yes, it is gorgeous, ambitious, and introduces new characters we've been hoping to see. But Im sorry, they packed way too much into this movie. You won't be bored, you'll be exhausted. The movie skips along so aggressively that I even had to stop and ask, wait, who is this America Chavez girl? Where'd she come from? Why does she have such an indiscernible set of powers? She goes from making portals, to using blue energy, to somehow overpowering Wanda??? Then reverts back to training with Doctor Strange??? Tell me how that makes sense.

Marvel took a risk here. We don't need to be confused to be entertained. I honestly couldnt spoil this film other than revealing a cameo or 2, because I don't understand what I just watched, and I'm nervous for where things are headed. I remember seeing the first Spiderman, that changed my life as a kid. I went home and drew spiderman pictures, got the toys, quoted it, rewatched it, and still do to this day. This, this is just over the top junk food cinema."
A treat for ALL Wanda / Scarlett Fans,"OKAY OKAY OKAY... First of all if you're expecting the movie version of Wanda to be AS EXTREME as in the comics, then you'll for sure be disappointed. HOWEVER, if you're a fan of the movie version's slowly growing Wanda THEN you'll love this one.

I won't spoil anything but leave 3 points why i love the film and 1 reason why i couldn't give it a 10.

WHY IT'S GOOD 1. It explores a new genre for Marvel without leaving what's already been effective too far. It has that horror feels to it but it's def still Marvel. It's filled with humor and ACTION.

2. The movie is OVERLOADED with FIGHTS! One thing I hate about superhero movies is when they focus on developing the story so much that they forgot people watch these films cause of the fight/magic scenes. This movie DELIVERED. First few minutes in and cool stuff's already happening. No dull moments.

3. They gave every character a TIME TO SHINE. It's so annoying when a movie ends up only focusing on one hero - think X-Men with Wolverine. THIS IS NOT THAT. The film gave everyone, even the fresh-faces enough time to be loved. *****I forkin loved the Illuminati part + Rachel McAdams is a badass.

Now, all that said, one major thing I hated is how I didn't feel like it's a Sam Raimi film. He usually has such a unique attack on the horror genre. But maybe it's cause this was never meant to be a full on scary movie... But still, to me sone scares felt flat. Too flat that i laughed - and wasn't sure if I should be laughing.

All in all- GO WATCH IT. It's an IMPORTANT movie in the Marvel universe. I swear 👌🏻👌🏻"
Wrong movie title,"While Doctor Strange is in the movie as a supporting character, this is not a movie about Doctor Strange. He didn't champion anything. It is a movie about the other character. Disney is destroying Marvel. I was very disappointed. Thanks Disney for destroying what should have been a great story."
A Blast from the Past in the Multiverse,"What if I told you that we are living in multiverse? You would have me committed or something. But this has nothing to do with me but has everything to do with how we perceive the unimaginable, the unattainable. We begin in the not so distant past when we met Stephen Strange. He did not even know who he was let alone a superhero. All Stephen knew he was destined for greatness.

Dr. Stephen Strange was incredible with his hands, in a good kind of way, but what he was about to embark upon was nothing short of the unimaginable. Now that we have come almost full circle, I am not going to sit here and tell you the plot to this movie because that would go against my ethical movie prowess and know-how, but I will tell you that even during friendship and relationships there is always some kind of evil lurking even among us.

When I first heard the name Benedict Cumberbatch, I did not expect anything to come about, but he has come into the scene quite nicely. From the Hobbit movies to Star Trek, and now bringing his own to a superhero that we can always rely and count on we know that he will be back with a full set of ways to combat evil with the mystic arts.

I loved every minute of this movie, and I cannot wait to see what comes next."
2nd Worst MCU Movie,"Opening scene just didn't make sense if sling rings exist.

Then you have a bizarre and pretty pointless villian. Like ago we get you wanted to milk a tv series first, but that storyline was done, can we please just have a proper storyline and not a weird mess with a laughable villain with laughable reasoning.

Sam clearly had no idea what to do with these characters and basically tried to write a pg horror movie without suceeding.

Only Black Widow is a worst MCU movie."
"""One need of someone"" can become a threat to the Multiverse",
Despite Raimi's best efforts with poor dialogue and a formulaic script Dr Strange lacks the magic and intrigue which the character and multiverse promised to deliver,Despite Sam Raimi's best efforts with poor dialogue and a formulaic script Dr Strange lacks the magic and intrigue which the character and multiverse concept promised to deliver. The injection of horror and surrealism into the MCU is long overdue but the film falls down in not steering hard enough into its directors strong suits and instead leaves a bad taste in the mouth when Marvel's 3rd act template is dragged out again to waining success. Danny Elfman delivers with the score which compliments Raimi's visuals brilliantly as per their Spiderman 2000s match up and newcomer Xochitl Gómez runs rings around a tired and bored seeming Cumberbatch and Adams who both seem like they'd rather be making Oscar bait dramas than box office slosh.
"Wow, people really over exaggerated with the negative reviews.","I saw many reviews claiming that there was no cohesive plot and that Dr. Strange was barely in the movie.

Both of these points are false. The movie does follow a specific plot line (though I'll leave my review free of spoilers). Doctor strange is absolutely in the movie. The people who say he's barely in it clearly did not watch the same movie I did. Yes, Wanda is in it a lot as well, but not more than strange. If you watch the movie, you'll understand why she's got a lot of screen time (again, I won't spoil!)

The only valid ""complaint"" is from people who wanted to see more of the multiverse. Though to be fair, this movie explored a few multiverses more than any other so I can't complain.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. Much more than the first."
Disappointment of the year,"Probably, I had really high expectations, considering all great actors featuring in this movie directed by Sam Raimi. However, I felt pure disappointment about the film from the very first minutes until the end. Haven't watched the last Thor movie yet but I've heard that it's not any better. Shame on Disney."
No Madness..,
America Chavez? Are you kidding me?,"Prime example of followng the step by step guide on how to make a Hollywood superhero movie in the current political climate.

Not PC to mention USA as the saviour of all? Simply name the Universe's first multi-dimensional, Latino, conflict refugee accordingly.

CGI filled BS."
Ridiculous,"Just when you thought a movie couldn't get any more ridiculous, this gem came along. I eventually turned it off when there was a fight using musical notes extrapolated from sheet music. The storyline was thin, acting abysmal and the movie lurched from one unrealistic fight scene to another."
it's good. it's entertaining. but it needed a longer runtime,"First of all, you basically need to have seen at least wandavision before you see this. It's the conclusion of her story after everything that happened post-infinity war and throughout that show. So catch up, refresh, whatever you need to do before watching this. I would also highly recommend you've seen the latest spider-man also as this picks up not long after the events of that movie.

That being said, for a 'doctor strange' movie, wanda shares essentially 50% of the screen. This isn't completely a doctor strange movie as it is 'doctor strange & the scarlet witch'.

Coming off the heels of spider-man no way home the expectations are extremely high going into this. Especially as this will be our first glimpse into the marvel multiverse; where essentially anything is possible and any characters could be introduced for the very first time.

The films pacing is very fast. And the villain is revealed very early on which i felt was a mistake but im not sure how else it would have been done. There is plenty of action, some jump-scares (this is supposed to be the most horror-esque marvel movie so far and it is sam raimi in the directors chair after all) and some wild spectacle and effects.

What lets this film down is it feels a little too rushed. We don't get much time to breath and there isn't really that much of a glimpse into the various universes or variants of characters we know. There also wasn't that many surprises with one of the biggest being given away in the main trailer. From that being given away i was really expecting even bigger surprises from the film but what we got was a little anti-climatic.

Overall the film is definitely worth seeing. There are some great battles, incredible effects, a few laughs and cool cameos. But don't set your expectations sky-high because they likely won't be matched in the same way No Way Home did.

7/10."
Another Marvel Disney Woke movie.,"Dont lose your time watching. Poor written story, more focused on ridiculising anything that is not fitting Disney's plans. Makes fun o Marvel lore and its classic heroes. Should not be considered a story of the Marvel lore."
More madness than multiverse,"A movie that was expected to deliver fell desperately flat and in a very confusing, surprisingly boring way. I would never have thought this film would disappoint, but, if you read between the lines, it does exactly that. The plot lines are convoluted when the character arcs finally rise and when effort is made to develop a cohesive plot, it's so catatonic you wonder why you even bothered. Of course, Disney and marvel loyalists will force it on everyone else as one of the best in the marvel series; however, truth be told, who cares? The marvel series is floundering and Disney is desperate to squeeze every penny out of it. Good riddance! Bring real film back."
Maybe in another universe...,"Chaotic, impossible to follow without the necessary foreknowledge, fight scenes for the sake of fight scenes, excessive use of special effects, lack of character development... The list goes on."
Perfectly marvellous,"Wow. This film was almost everything I wished for and more. From the very get go, you are swept up in a wave of action up till the very end. You know that feeling where you watch a show/film, and even before the film ends, you're dying to know how it ends, yet at the same time dreading it, knowing that it's probably going to be a long while before a sequel is made? Well, that was exactly how it was like for me. With little references to other marvel films peppered around, it truly makes for a film that leverages on the expansive MCU etc. For a film that marvel geeks will appreciate.

Even so, at the end of the day, this film is by no means perfect, it's positives eg 'action all the way' makes for a film that feels incomplete on its own, with a strong need to be (fairly) well versed with the whole MCU and marvel in general to truly appreciate this film more than it may seem to the average viewer.

TLDR: A marvellous film for a marvel fan, but probably just above average for the common man."
Love it!!,Arhhhhhh!!! I love it!!!!! Oh My Sweet Child!!! The plot is awesome!!! And the character!!!! And let's not forget the actors and actresses!!!!!! Jesus! They choose one hot character!!!!!! It's so good!!! And the effects are WOW!!!!!!! But it's just that Benedict Cumberbatch when he is being a zombie you could see the make up! But not really a big deal. I would love to see it again soon!!!!!
This is that thing that MCU needs the most,I love all the actors in Multiverse of Madness and the honest this movie not need call Multiverse of Madness it's should be Multiverse of Horror It was really scary. I enjoy a lot only one problem I get is the ending was not so well otherwise Doctor Strange into the Multiverse of Madness really hock me in form the starting.... !!!!
What a Joke!,"The movie is an absolute disaster! A parody of the sort. The movie took leaps from fantasy to thriller to horror to Bollywood!!! Way too many loopholes, logic and lazy writing. I don't know why everyone is praising Rami, the director was horrid. Literally. Xochitl Gomez was not great AT ALL in portraying America Chavez, the twins too bad actors.

The whole movie was stitched badly. The story line was great, but the direction was bad. It was like watching an animated movie without holding back on CGI."
A great picture,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a wonderful film. The cast performs well, highlighted by Cumberbatch's strong lead. Olsen especially stands out in support, clearly giving her all to the character. Altogether, the various roles present are all-around fun and intriguing, which is aided by the awesome premise in addition to the way the film is written to feel like a true journey. There are many emotional moments, too. Although the film is put on a large scale, these more impactful points are actually relatable. Throughout, then, the audience is able to see the characters grow and ultimately change. Another interesting facet is the dynamics among the cast. This movie pairs many different characters together within, allowing for more depth in the central roles from these interactions. However, a couple scenes that should feel more powerful are not entirely so. While the audience can feel these moments just from the weight of what happens onscreen, there needed to be more to the characters' reactions. This being said, the majority of these sequences are handled very well. Even better is the perfect way the tension builds, between the decently fast pacing and the way the characters gradually learn about what's occurring. The film doesn't undermine the gravity of the situation with its comedy, either. The jokes both hit and miss, but they do give personality and that is appreciable. Regardless, the intensity of the action often takes over. Despite some noticeable quick cutting for a couple fights, the choreography is largely fun and particularly the visual effects are outstanding. The CGI is truly great to look at all throughout and undeniably delivers during the action. Elfman's score has a multitude of vibrant points, as well. Overall, this sequel delivers much of what the audience wanted and proves to be an exciting adventure lacking any dull moments. There is a feeling that the filmmakers could have been more grand in scope, but ultimately the direction they chose made sense and kept the feature largely focused for a plot that already contains absolutely mind blowing phenomena. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness certainly has its flaws, but is undoubtedly worth the watch."
An Honest Review,
Spectacularly unspectacular,"Marvel phase 4 seems to think it can sacrifice coherent story telling for a bit more wow factor. This whole multi verse thing might have some major intrinsic issues...

For this film more specifically - The horror stuff and visuals are cool; but not quite enough to save what's basically a jumble of barely interesting set pieces poorly stitched together."
What can I say? I LOVED it!,"There's exciting action from the get-go ... but ""Multiverse of Madness"" also is t afraid to let its guard down with several heartbreaking, tear-jerking moments. The villain's motivations are sympathetic and understandable, there are plenty of great moments sprinkled in for both new and returning characters, the visual effects are absolutely breathtaking, it was AMAZING! Easily one of my top five, maybe even top three, favorite MCU movies!"
I liked it more than I thought I would!,Dr Strange and the Multiverse of Madness was better than I expected. As close to a horror movie as Marvel are likely to get. And by that I mean think Michael J Fox in Frightners level horror. In fact that is what I thought of when i came out. I liked Frightners and so I liked this movie.
amazing visuals,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was definitely a decent mcu film almost as good as the first Doctor Strange film. I know peoples expectations were extremely high for this film and I would have loved to see the same X-men from fox's universe in this film and not just a variant Professor X but still it was nice to see some of these character never before seen in the mcu. The scene was the musical notes was just AWESOME that was literally so cool I can't even describe it such a cool fight between Doctor Strange and evil Doctor Strange. Also finally we got to see John Krasinski as Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards) a fan casting everybody has been asking for (may he Rest In Peace)
"This Is Marvel's Worst Movie ever, I'll Tell You Why?",
Doctor Strange and the Hairpiece of Badness,
"Cool effects, but pointless action","Just a sequence of action scenes and effects. At the end, boring.

It might be a good choice when you need some entertainment during ironing. When watching in the cinema, it is a waste of time and money."
Tiring,Disney keep the political nonsense out of your movies! This is a movie that is going to be watched by children! We actually got up and left. After the 2 moms scene it just ruined the movie.
Plot vs CGI?,This movie from Disney Marvel had nothing but CGI. 2 yr old wrote the plot. After watching The Batman you begin to see the difference between a Plot vs. CGI dumb em down movies.
This is the really the madness of cinema,I don't know why people are giving this movie rating 1/10. They must be jealous of marvel that their fav cringe Snyder movies can't beat marvel. So I don't care their rating and I will give this movie 10/10 cause this is the next level movie and it is the madness of cinema!!!!
It's best to just let the creatives create,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, the sequel to 2016's Doctor Strange, continues to delve into the mystical side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as our favorite wizards battle a number of multiversal threats willing to destroy it all to achieve their goals. Doctor Stephen Strange, former Sorcerer Supreme, is forced to deal with threats both old and new as he traverses universes to protect America Chavez, a young woman born with the ability to naturally hop through universes as she's being hunted. With assistance from trusty ally Wong, Strange appeals to former Avenger Wanda Maximoff for help in fending off this new threat to reality.

Multiverse of Madness is what happens when a filmmaker is presented with the option of delivering massive dopamine hits to their willing audience or telling a layered story that decides to progress the characters instead of the overall narrative of the MCU. Luckily, writer Michael Waldron (also responsibly for the Loki show on Disney+), director Sam Raimi, and cinematographer John Mathieson choose to tackle the latter, deepening the relationship between Strange and Christine Palmer, further exploring Wanda's pain and desires, and introducing Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez. In what has become a now famous MCU move of not fully adapting the source material from which some of the films draw their inspiration, Raimi and company manage to match the tone of 2005's House of M storyline without ever actually cribbing from it. Themes of learning to trust, facing past regrets, and wants vs needs are fully explored throughout the movie. While some fans have been primed for cameos galore, Raimi keeps the story in check, keeping the cameos to a small handful that are still sure to delight and stoke the endless fires of speculation. In the same vein that Captain America: Civil War was a star-studded event that still strongly focused on its titular character, the same can be said for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness: regardless of who shows up, Doctor Strange is front and center, appearing in almost every frame of the movie. Raimi and Waldron never lose sight of the fact that this is Stephen Strange's film, a fact that, in the hands of less talented filmmakers (or filmmakers less willing to stick to their guns), might've been their doom. Raimi's horror sensibilities are on full display, setting the grimmest tone seen in an MCU movie yet. While not full-on horror (it's Disney after all), Raimi manages to push that envelope as far as he possibly can while adhering to the universe set up before his arrival. The end result is a bleak, relentless movie that still manages to deliver on the fun adventure and surprises that MCU fans have come to expect.

Benedict Cumberbatch, returning to the MCU for his sixth appearance, proves yet again why he was the perfect casting for the character of Doctor Strange. Cumberbatch's ability to play intelligent, arrogant men is put on full display at the beginning of the film, giving audiences the most accurate representation of the character yet. At this point fully comfortable in the role, Cumberbatch plays the good doctor this time out with an ounce of melancholy tinged at the edges of his performance. Where Cumberbatch leaves the character in the movie's closing moments as compared to its opening proves Strange has gone on a massive journey, both physically and figuratively. Shaping up to be one of the backbones of the MCU, Cumberbatch's steady, dependable performance will be a delight to see for years to come.

I say all that to say Elizabeth Olsen puts Cumberbatch to shame in almost every frame of the movie. Stealing scene after scene, Olsen has never been better as Wanda Maximoff than she is in Multiverse of Madness. An impetus for the events of the film, Olsen's Wanda is a woman with a one track mind: getting back to her kids first seen WandaVision. It's Wanda's sole drive in the movie and Olsen leans fully into peeling back every layer of the character. While playing multiple versions of herself, Olsen gets to display a range of emotions from bitter disgust to outright despair. Even when not on screen, Wanda's presence is felt, easily making her the standout character of the entire movie.

Unfortunately, not every character gets a chance to shine like Wanda does. Mainly, the disservice falls to Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez, member of the Young Avengers. While the MCU has been quietly introducing all the members in the background of other movies, America is a key character of Multiverse of Madness. It's this fact that makes the viewing frustrating to realize how little development the character gets, outside of a minute or two of backstory. As the film's overall Living McGuffin, America is hunted and pursued by any numbers of creatures, and while it's Stephen Strange's mission to keep her safe, the story does scant little to give us a reason to care about her. While Xochitl does a good job with the material she's given, there's times where she disappears from the film completely, sacrificed either in editing or in the writing stages to give more time for developing other relationships. Possibly the film's biggest disappointment, Xochitl's presence is a delight when she's on screen and absence noticed when she's not. Disney did somehow less than the bare minimum in regard to America's orientation; a character in the comics that's unabashedly, proudly lesbian gets little more than a mention of having two mothers and an LGBTQ pin on her infamous denim jacket. There's plenty more left to be mined with America, and hopefully Xochitl gets the screen time she deserves going forward.

Returning for larger roles than anticipated are Rachel McAdams as nurse Christine Palmer and Benedict Wong, the current Sorcerer Supreme. The relationship between Palmer and Strange is the heart of the film, kicked off by a seemingly simple question that becomes one of the motifs throughout. While the MCU has had a varying amount of success when it comes to portraying relationships, Strange and Palmer's is certainly one of the more interesting ones. Playing off decisions made during the 2016 Doctor Strange, viewers meet Palmer as she's getting married, with Stephen in the audience. An interplay between them somewhat reminiscent of the exchange between Tony and Pepper at the bar in the first Iron Man but with a more somber tone, it's clear that Strange and Palmer's relationship on screen is one of the MCU's most complex. Benedict Wong, slimmed down and looking better than ever, is a delight as Wong, Strange's right hand man and staunchest ally. With an increased role due to his responsibilities as the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong is allotted more screen time and more to do with that screen time. In a few scant appearances since his debut in the first movie, Wong's glowup from sanctum librarian to head wizard has been a joy to experience and the bond between him and Strange make for some of the highlights of the movie.

Almost 20 years to the exact date of the release of his first superhero movie, director Sam Raimi returns to the big budget blockbuster world of capes and tights to deliver a movie that only he could make. Featuring all the familiar camera angles, shot compositions, and tonal uneasiness we've come to expect from him, Multiverse of Madness is just as much a Raimi film as it is an MCU movie. While it's unfortunate previous director Scott Derrickson exited the project due to creative differences, the end result should make the audience appreciate living in the universe where this film exists. Drawing from his previous works that are signature Raimi style, the veteran director (not seen since 2013's Oz the Great and Powerful) managed to create a tone and feel far more sinister than anything imagined within the MCU thus far. What we get are the classic elements of horror: jump scares, unyielding dreadful tension, and outrageously vivid creature work. Kicking the film off by dropping the audience into the middle of an action scene and keeping his foot on the pedal, Raimi's first and third acts are amongst some of the best in the MCU. Unfortunately, the second act slows the story down drastically once the multiverse is fully established. Handling Strange's story, his relationship with Christine Palmer, Wanda's story, and the introduction of America Chavez and the multiverse is a tall order with a lot of moving parts, and those parts don't always rub up against each other in ways that flow naturally. Raimi makes up for these incongruent pieces with some top notch action scenes that give the characters the opportunities to display a full array of their power sets. For everything that doesn't work in the movie (namely, the second act slog and the handling of America Chavez), Raimi manages to provide enough good to counterbalance that.

Overall, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness proves that, in most cases, it's best to just let the creatives create. Sam Raimi manages to walk the tightrope balancing MCU storytelling with his unique style, blending them to create an experience that is both familiar to diehards while simultaneously being wholly refreshing. Far darker in tone than any previous film to date, the magical realm of the MCU continues to be developed and fleshed out in creative and entertaining ways. While still firmly Benedict Cumberbatch's movie, Elizabeth Olsen dominates every scene she's in, delivering a captivating and heart wrenching performance that will forever cement her in the annals of great MCU actors. At just a hair over two hours, the movie starts at a breakneck pace and ends in a similar fashion while possibly leaving more questions than it answers. An absolute must-see in the IMAX format if possible, the movie is a jaw dropping spectacle filled with great characters moments, small nuggets of contained surprises, and dynamic set pieces."
Action Packed from Start to Finish,"Didn't take long for the storyline to get up to speed. Was action packed the whole time, no dull moments. Great story line that pushes the marvel timeline along well and overall good movie."
Felt Kinda Rushed,"I had huge expectation for this movie. I thought the movie was going to be something about Mordo as the previous post scene of Doctor Strange hinted. Few things I liked, few things I didn't.

I liked watching Wanda in her full potential. I also get where the horror tag comes from. The movie is way gorier than other MCU movies.

After watching Loki and NWH, I thought Doctor strange will make some links with the big scene, like Age of Ultron did with Infinity Stone. I clearly still can't fathom what the MCU phase 4 is going to be about.

Fighting scenes were descent. The story felt kinda rushed. I was looking forward to some fun multiverse where we would be able to see what the other superhero becomes to be. This disappointed me a big time."
A Movie that Delivers,"This movie brings something that I believe many of the original MCU watchers wanted. A film that is more mature and darker. The part of this movie that had me loving it was that it was not scary to add jump scares and violent elements. In recent years the MCU has been rapidly cliche with the funny humor and light-hearted tones. I believe this movie will lay the groundwork for films yet to come. Some of my criticism lies in the fact that there was no single main villain in the story. There is an antagonist, but there is not a person pulling the strings, and I believe that is where the movie does struggle a lot."
So bad I thought it's a parody!!,"Horrible movie!

Don't watch it if you are a marvel fan.

It was a terrible act. The plot was miserable. And the whole script is so bad, I might have cried in the middle...

In between i thought it was a parody of marvel.. I am seriously so disappointed of this production.

If marvel goes on with this kind of movies they will lose a lot of fans.

From now on I'll think twice if I want to watch a marvel movie in the cinema."
A good but a little dissapointing experience,
A very average Marvel movie,
Why marvel why ?,"Love the films, but it was way too dark and full of horror for a 12A ruined the film for me. Don't get me wrong I love marvel always will be a massive fan but was expecting a lot more from the film could of been so much better and had a lot of potential."
Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Mehness,"Writing this in the theater while waiting for post credits, so long story short: Sam Raimi swung for the fences and got a ground-rule double. This was unintentionally incoherent and the film style didn't really sync up to the story. It's not the worst (hey there Black Widow and Captain Marvel) but it's solidly in Iron Man 2 territory. Didn't really excite me for any more MCU stuff."
"Rick and Morty Is multiverse, this Is madness","I actually liked It, i just think it had so much more potential. I dont like Sam Raimi and i really think there were better options, more disrupting, but It Is what It Is. The cliches suck, but the visuals and some fight scenes are pretty great. Maybe in another universe Justin Roiland and Dan Harmond could make this a masterpiece."
Political posturing + poor quality,"Overall the movie is watchable, but it's not good. Disjointed storyline, cobbled together, tacky one-liners, the script and presumably the directing is so poor that a strong cast gives 'meh' performances,

LGBTQ+ agenda- America's parents are lesbians. I don't personally care about this from a moral stance, but it feels so forced and out of place that it stands out as such. If I want to have political agendas thrown in my face, I'll log onto Facebook. I watch movies for entertainment, not political posturing. More and more Disney's content feels like it's part of the harsh negative political divide in the US, and it may not be coincidence that the quality of their content is getting progressively more and more shoddy."
This got very dark very fast,This movie really surprised me. Constant imagery of occult and satanism. Gruesome deaths like impaling and slicing. More a horror movie and not what I expected for a Marvel film. Very disappointed.
Epic in all aspects 👌🏾,Noticed this has some bad reviews on here but seriously.... I got what I expected from this sequel. The plot made so much sense and will continue to make sense in upcoming phases of the marvel universe. Performances from Elizabeth Olsen were exceptional...far more than her Avengers Cameo. Also the CGIs and the ATMOS will make you appreciate every fight scene
I'm Ok are you ok?,"Wow this movie was really.... very...Ok.

That's about it.

My wife said she is done with Marvel. I can't really blame her.

But all in in all, this was OK. See it if you have nothing else to do."
Not Your Typical Marvel Movie!,"Unlike the first film, Multiverse of Madness doesn't follow the typical MCU formula. Raimi truly made the film his own, adding in many of his signature horror elements and even references from his Spider-Man movies. Additionally, Raimi makes use of the ""zombie vision"" angle several times, a clear homage to his work on the Evil Dead movies. Both can be seen with many of the action sequences.

Both Elizabeth Olsen and Xochitl Gomez easily give the best performances of the film. During Wanda's more villainous turn as Scarlet Witch, Olsen puts all of Wanda's grief and pain front and center and see how she has become so corrupted. And of course our introduction to Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez was more of a scene-stealer than I initially anticipated. She brought all the character traits I expect from a coming-of-age superhero arc, in addition to an endearing form of charisma to the role. Gomez is a welcomed newcomer to the MCU and I can't wait to see what more she brings to Chavez!

Although the film does suffer from somewhat poor pacing in its first act, it still manages to balance its convoluted storytelling. Additionally, while the film's MCU-style humor was a bit much at times, it felt a bit more natural compared to its predecessor. I wished we got more of Raimi's typical style of humor, but the film is ultimately part of the MCU and I shouldn't complain too much.

When we say this movie is not your typical Marvel movie, I mean does not feel like a Marvel movie. It has the Marvel logo, but it is closer to a horror movie, complete with jump scares, an eerie atmosphere and nightmare-inducing visuals. Whenever Scarlet Witch is on screen, I thought for a moment I was watching The Exorcist. Raimi's roots in horror are on full display, as he introduces the MCU to an uncharted direction."
Awful,"What an awful sequel to one of the best Marvel movies.

Just AWFUL!!!!!!

They brought so many expensive actors for nothing. Movie doesn't have a meaning. It's like a cartoon with no actual point."
Very disappointing...,"This one is so disappointing... It's more like a bad horror movie than a marvel one. The story and the content of the movie are just so bad and poor.

In my opinion Some female superhero characters are just perfect but i hate the idea of replacing EVERY male superhero with a female one."
Surprisingly good!,"I can honestly say before viewing Dr Strange 2, I was not a Marvel fan. I watched Wanda Vision, but that was all. I wanted to go to the theater, and see anything. Maybe I was a little irritated by the constant green screen action, but, this is a mindless popcorn film.

Probably the highlight for me, was re introducing Professor Xavier; fun, familiar but ultimately, I wanted more screen time with Stewart.

There are a lot of quick changes / things flying at you quickly. This is definitely one of those film you need to watch two more times to catch the easter eggs. For putting my toes into the Marel waters, I am happy I saw this. Again, I haven't seen the other Marvel cannon films, so I can't "" gauge"" if this was good, but hey, I enjoyed it."
Visually mesmerizing and crazy movie experience!,This was one of my favorite movie theater experiences. So much was happening that it was impossible to feel bored. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. Any comic book fan will surely enjoy this and smile.
An entertaining mess,"Helmed by Sam Raimi, his influences are obvious throughout (most of) the film. These are the parts that work best - eyeballs popping, ghastly witches, ghostly spectres and fun jump scares. Unfortunately the whole film feels a bit undecided in what it wants to be.

If the focus and goal had been to make a spooky Evil Dead-esque Marvel movie, this would have surely been a success.

But sadly it tries to be many things but doesn't commit to anything fully - resulting in a tonal and narrative mess. A plot that neither pushes the MCU forward in terms of story, nor does it fully embrace the horror elements to make this truly unique."
"Hire better writers, Marvel. Multiverse of Zero Madness","When you have abundance of resources and still end up writing a story that can fit a single piece of paper, you've stopped caring about the universe and are getting tired of it. The movie was tolerable because of its remarkable actors. It felt like another episode of What If, just stretched to fit 2 hours of runtime. All the action sequences were rushed. You can give it a miss and wait for the digital release if you haven't seen.

Dear Marvel, stop chasing quick bucks and stop taking your audience for granted."
"don't know why people are so mixed on this, i was on the edge of my seat the whole time",
Good actors wasted.,
"""I LOVE YOU IN EVERY UNIVERSE.""","I understand why most of you give low score for this: your expectations gone wrong.

You believe this movie would be a same taste like NWH: fanservice, lots cameo, roaming multiverses. That's too childish.

Sam Raimi did a great job. He truly knows what multiverse is, and what madness is. And know what kind of sorcerer our Mr. Doctor is.

Unlike the other MCUs, this movie is so brutal and horror. Brace yourself, especially for the main antagonis act.

For the story, I like it and beautiful."
Very disappointing,"I liked Dr. Strange movie one, I didn't enjoy this. It might be be because I haven't watched Wandavision or that I see time-hopping as a cheap and easy 'get out of jail free card' that trivialises any plot, I really don't know. What I do know is, I'm finding myself cheering for the bad guys more and more often 🤷‍♂️"
I loved it.,
Very nice,"Very nice and entertaining movie that never gets boring and has several plot passages that are really well researched and done well and this is very difficult given the mess of multiverses. But there are two points that I have not gone down, and they are why the villain is bad which in my opinion makes no sense for the evolution of the character and the part of the now abused believe in yourself that makes the hero win."
Not as good as the first one + DS finds himself in the Multiverse of Wokeness,"""We go on red."" + ""food's free in most universes"": yes, once you know who owns Hollywood, you will figure out who is subliminally pushing this commie garbage down your throats. And the bad capitalist got beaten in the end. And lesbian mothers were not missing in the movie, of course. Yes, that is the new Doctor Strange movie. There wasn't enough of him in the movie, the plot was not strong enough to make you want to watch it again sometime but it was very colorful - I'll give it that. I wonder how Scott Derrickson envisioned it. It would have undoubtedly been better since the 1st Doctor S was amazing but well, Marvel has to push demented agendas onto people so the ""creative differences"" were of course off-putting to Scott and we got this instead. I guess we can't have everything."
"Fun ride, people had fun, but it feels like a movie version of What If","Do you remember the more or less misguided What If? Marvel animation series? Well, this film references that and is pretty much a full movie version of it. A lot of characters and alternate characters introduced and at such a terrific pace that they get no development whatsoever, instead they mostly die. But the visuals are well done and I felt like the special CGI effects guys had all the fun! The actors seemed to enjoy acting as well. Also... was Wanda supposed to be so powerful? Why is she always the villain who everyone forgives at the end ?

We get a mix of fun madness and great effects at the expense of a coherent story. Isn't that what a Marvel film always was? The problem is that I can't remember anymore. There were so many movies and I barely remember a few of them. I remember there was a time when people were praising Marvel films for great characters and story, nominated them for Oscars (though mainly for special effects and the likes), but I don't remember which. We already are in the multiverse of madness. Nothing makes sense and we forgot what that even means.

Bottom line: enjoyable ride, but that's all it was. It barely registered as a part of the existing MCU, other than some common characters and many references.

P. S. So tired of the cliché of the grieving mother who is allowed to do anything because she lost her children. If only there was a way to make more! No, let's break the universe instead. Much easier."
Wandavision 2,
Disapointment,"Disappointed .. :(, It was a mix of horror from Sam Raimi and a mix of Walt Disney, ending up in a incomplete movie, predictable and just.. weird (not saying strange).

I miss the good old times where MCU movies were simpler."
What did I just watch?,"If you enjoy nonstop hand spinning and color throwing this movie is for you. The magic of this movie is magic, and that means there are absolutely zero rules. None. Zip. Want to possess your own corpse? Got it! Want to fly? Woosh. Want to possess someone's mind when it's convenient but forget that's possible other times? Do it. Throw any kind of color imaginable from your hands? Easy.

Now if you love all those super ambiguous super powers being thrown around for 2 hours straight this movie is for you. If you want any character development, coherent storyline, dialogue, or any explanations then I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
Hot Garbage,"I really wanted to love this movie but it was just filled with useless cameos, terrible storytelling and pacing along with so many parts that were unneeded and stupid, sam raimi's directing was fine, some scenes were very well shot but i just can't like this film."
Is it a Doctor Strange movie or is it a Wanda and America´s play?,
This is the best Post-Pandemic Mcu content.,"The early reactions were right: this is NOT a cameo-fest, so do not go into this movie expecting every character that appeared in previous movies to show up. Also, this is a Raimi- movie, with elements of horror and violence throughout - becoming one of the more graphic MCU films.

I still haven't seen Raimi's horror movies so I can't describe exactly how his style was incorporated into MOM, but I can tell that I really dug the horror elements in this movie. They low-key were awesome.

A lot of insane visuals and it definitely would be an overwhelming movie for a lot of people (and not necessarily a bad way!). I think they could have gone more creative and insane with the 'Multiverse' aspect but there sure were a lot of 'Madness'.

Marvel, this (Letting Unique directors and Visions in ur content) is the way.

I hope Raimi makes more marvel stuff."
Top 3 worst MCU to date,
superb movie,
Lives up to the 'Madness' in its title,"This movie is totally different than what we've seen before in the MCU. And I'm not talking about storyline, which is simple, but the directing, the CGI, the actors' performance, the horror elements and the soundtrack are all amazing. Sam Raimi proved again what he's capable of and created one of the most unique Marvel movies ever."
Not as great as expected,
I am disappointed,"Being a huge fan of the first movie and highly anticipating this sequel I am left disappointed. I might be in the minorty here and thats okay but I feel the movie was unfocused and a convoluted mess. I consider this a cash grab entry for MCU and will definitely not be seeing the next one at the cinema. The effects are great as it should be but the acting was uninspired especially by the leads. This for me sits next to Thor Ragnarok as the worst entries in the MCU. Marvel has lost is magic and the films are too focused on spectacle instead of story and also unnecessarily injecting wokeness in the latest entries that is not required or asked for by the key demografic of this genre. See it or dont, either way will not impact you very much, I promise."
Best marvel film ever,"Undoubtedly, Sam Raimi's best film. I think it is the result of a lifetime of his artistic activity. If we didn't know the meaning of science fiction in this movie, now we know........"
Fun with heart,"Doctor Strange is my favorite Marvel character. This comes from my college days when one of my roommates had a stack of Dr. Strange comics and I tore through them - one of the few Marvel comics that I have actually read. So I was thrilled to find out that Sam Raimi was coming back (was he ever gone?) to direct the 2nd solo Dr. Strange film, DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS.

And it does not disappoint for while DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS is not quite as ""mad"" as one would expect by the build up to this film, it delivers solid action by actors playing characters that are easy to root for (or root against) all done with a wink in the eye and a focus on Marvel's secret weapon...relationships and heart.

You will find no brooding ""dark knights"" in this one.

Sprightly Directed by Sam Raimi (THE EVIL DEAD), Multiverse (as I will call it from here on out) finds our titular hero (Benedict Cumberbatch) connecting with - and working to save - a multiverse hopping heroine in the form of America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) from an evil that wishes to drain her of her multiverse hopping powers.

What happens next is a multiverse hopping action/adventure/horror/chase film that really shows off the cinematic sensibilities of Director Raimi who's mark is all over this film...for the better. Multiverse swerves really close to being a horror film, but, fortunately for it's box office fortunes, remains firmly in the action/adventure/superhero genre. Only a director like Raimi can ride this fine line as well as he has and it works for this film.

Cumberbatch, of course, is terrific as Doctor Stephen Strange and he slides, comfortably, back into the cloak and sling-ring. Benedict Wong (Wong - The Sorcerer Supreme), Rachel McAdams (Dr. Christine Palmer) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (Baron Mordo) all reprise their characters from the first film and they all seem re-energized in their roles for this one while Xochitl Gomez makes a winning debut as America Chavez.

But, make no mistake, the personae that steals this film is Elizabeth Olson as the grieving Wanda Maximoff/Scarlett Witch who Dr. Strange reaches out to when America Chavez falls into his lap. She is outstanding and is really the driving force here. It would not be a misnomer to say that this film easily could have been titled THE SCARLET WITCH IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS.

My one quibble with this film is that it doesn't go to enough Multiverses to suit my tastes and is not quite as ""mad"" as one would hope - our hero does spend a rather large amount of time in one multiverse - but that is a minor issue and this one multiverse does bring many fun cameos...cameos that will not be spoiled here.

Which brings up one last point. See this film, if you can, in a theater full of the aforementioned fanboys. The full house IMAX theater that I caught this film in went absolutely nuts when one specific person showed his/her face for their extended cameo and that was a very fun time.

As is DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS - it works well as a stand alone film, but if you want to do ""some homework"", check out the Disney+ TV Series WANDAVISION (essential), the first DOCTOR STRANGE movie (good background) and the animated Disney+ series MARVEL'S WHAT IF (some nice callbacks).

And, of course, stay for the end credits...it sets up DOCTOR STRANGE 3, a film that can't get here soon enough.

Letter Grade: A-

8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
Just stop,The hype train has left the station. I had high hopes for this film which in all honesty lost my attention after maybe an hour. Glad I saw it in a streaming service and not rip off cinema prices.
"Despite the ridiculous plot, it is a very entertaining movie",
Multiverse of boredom...,"If you like movies with dull plots and acting, this film is perfect for you. The story just felt bland and seemed like a big waste of time. Throughout the film we're told the multiverse is a wild place with unlimited possibilities and outcomes but we hardly see that instead we just get given a few boring areas in the film that are blatantly just green screened and lack any realness or emotion. The story itself is so boring and the main antagonists reasons for being the antagonist are genuinely laughable, it's that stupid. I'm not a big fan of the MCU admittedly but 'Dr Strange (2016)' was one of the few I enjoyed the most and it's a shame the sequel failed to live up to it whatsoever. The main reason I was exited for 'Dr Strange and the Multiverse of Madness' was cameos from characters that haven't been introduced yet or have been introduced in previous franchises however these cameos feel so pointless and for the sake of getting peoples attention which 'Marvel Studios' clearly saw as a cash grab after the success of 'Spider-Man: No way home'. It's funny to be saying that the cameos were what I was looking forward to the most yet now I've seen the movie I'm genuinely disappointed with them. Especially considering how long they last in the film. Would I watch this film again? Probably not.

My IMDB score 5/10 Viewed on VUE cinema 5/5/22."
Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Writers who don't know what they're doing,
Messy multiverse of madness,"The previous Doctor Strange movie while not particularly unique in terms of plot certainly had a lot of great visuals and action to allow it to stand out. This film also has a simple plot, but mad pacing and visuals. It is what it is advertising.

To start with the good, performances from Cumberbatch and Olsen are fantastic, both giving it their all. Olsen's Wanda Maximoff whilst different to her previous appearances in terms of personality successfully frightens the viewer and that is further helped by good directing.

Sam Raimi brings his horror movie charm to this film and the film is at its best in these tense, scary and brutal moments. This film pushes the violence to its limit for a PG-13 movie and it is glorious. The cinematography and visuals are stellar, weird and unique that makes this film stand out from other MCU entries. Danny Elfman's score further heightens the film's moments of tension.

The problems come with the plot which is messy. There is a lot in this movie and while it does a decent job balancing most of it, there certainly could've been more time to develop characters, ideas and themes. There are also some inconsistencies in the mechanics of the film and this is mostly ignored. The most glaring issues are moments of fan service which whilst neat, don't add much to the plot and are gone without being developed.

Overall, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is another decent marvel movie that stands out due to its visuals, tone and style held together by a messy plot and faltering in moments of fan service and character development. Still it's worth watching for its uniqueness in style."
CGI for children who've had too many drugs,"What a waste of talent!

One long Computer graphics performance with VERY BAD make-believe.

TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE!

The millions wasted on this shows why the wealthy need to be taxed more!"
It's a whole different atmosphere from marvel and I love it!,"Easily one of my favorite marvel films, about time they change the theme of the repetitive cliche of some of these films. They did so good with this new atmosphere and change they brought into the MCU for this specific film. There are many scenes where I was like woah they allowed this? Also idk how this film isn't Rated R, Sam Raimi thank you! Kids you've been warn."
A Supreme Disappointment.,"I've been avoiding MCU films, as they've been directed lately by those that gave us the travesty that is ""You, Me & Dupree"",... but this one is by Sam Raimi, so it should be a standout, & possibly another one of his masterpieces, right? WRONG!!!

This is basically another random piece in the endless jigsaw puzzle that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, meaning that, unless you have a photographic memory for the infinite storylines & characters in the series, you might as well not bother. As with most of the entries in this franchise, I felt completely lost & disinterested.

I don't go to these films wanting to be disappointed, but they constantly let me down, because they are not made for fans of good cinema, but for indiscriminate buffs of MCU lore.

Also, Benedict Cumberbatch does not suit an American accent."
Waste of time to watch,
Marvel Goes Woke and Followed It Up With Terrible CGI.,Your typical 2022 movie where the main character HAS to have two same sex parents and they let the audience know 10 minutes in so parents have to have that conversation AGAIN. CGI budget must of been cut compared to the expectations you would be expect from a Marvel production. Would recommend for ADULTS when it comes out for free for some cheap entertainment but don't recommend spending any household income on this one.
The story works and the movies awesome,
A multiverse of madness indeed. Sam Raimi is back and I relish the freedom he's been given in this movie.,"Sam Raimi, director of the three first Spider-Man movies, is back again on the superhero arena to craft the most barbarically crazy multiversal story thus far in the MCU.

Very mild spoilers ahead(?)

And as such, he delivers not only amazing action scenes with mesmerizing visuals and imaginative ""magic"" (something we don't quite see as often anymore); but also heartfelt and compelling characters and arcs that come full circle in one way or the other at the end.

However, something might catch some by surprise, the aformentioned director is not only known by directing endearing and compelling character moments through amazing visuals, but he is also known by his passion and history in horror. A genre he understands well and makes use of to incite fear and some scares in all madness about. So expect horror movie elements sprinkled throughout the movie. Personally, I believe it works in the movie's favor given the particularly witchcraftian nature of both main characters.

Nevertheless, the movie isn't exempt of some flaws. While these won't ruin your enjoyment of the film, for those seeking more out of it in terms of storytelling, script and filmmaking; unfortunately the movie has too much going on for its own good. And there are many sequence of exposition that right out explains artifacts, characters and even relationships. However, the movie knows this and the director tries to keep them light and direct through creative sequences. The movie is trying to do many things so it has problems slowing down to make the emotional moments hit harder. Nevertheless, if you like non-stop pacing in a movie you are in luck because here it's all over the place, there's always something happening to keep you invested and that makes the action and visuals thrust you into the next madness. But, as with any frantic pace, it has trouble breathing and taking a moment to take in what just happened.

Other than that, the movie excells at entertainment and character development. Additionally, while the multiverse concept is present in the movie is not overplayed nor overused, so it allows for less confusion. Marvel fans will also find some interesting cameos, references and full on groundbreaking cameos that makes the movie a must see if you want to follow the MCU's unraveling stories to come....

IN CONCLUSION, the movie is a fast-paced, non-stop visual and narrative trip into the world of magic and multiversal travel, the biggest one so far in the MCU. And thanks to the particular unique voice that Sam Raimi gives it, makes it stand out from the rest and a welcome edition to the crazy wizarding world of Doctor Strange and Marvel."
Extraordinary! Sam Raimi did a wonderful job!,"As a Marvel fan this is a epic way presenting the Multiverse to us. I can't understand why some people trying to demotivate people. I know those people will regret one day in the future. Whatever, Don't listen to negative reviews. The movie is absolutely amazing. The way they connected cameos are brilliantly done by Sam Raimi! Hats off!!"
"Not great, not terrible - 3.6 Roentgen","Not great, not terrible. Dyatlov was in charge it seems.

The script is mediocre at best and the story suffers from unnecessary complexity (has a bit of Inception vibes in this regard).

The pacing seems a bit off and you get constant bombardment of 360 degree CGI, which seems a tad too much, even for a superhero flick.

The ending has a bit of a laughable character arc of the villain. Not sure what they were thinking when coming up with this one."
A film that fails to satisfy the audience nor have high value,
I was multi-surprised!,"Held off seeing this because of the mediocre reviews - watched on Disney Plus last night. Super disappointed that I didn't see this in theatres!

The horror element was a nice change from the typical light PG-13 we get from the MCU - would love a hard R Scarlet Witch movie or series!

Cumberbatch is just an okay Dr. Strange - he is what was holding this back from a 10 for me. Great actor, just not the right character for him. I was also a little put off by the ""Rainbow Brite"" vibes I got with the new character. That star portal was off-putting.

Small gripes, considering how well this movie was done, Raimi deserves credit for moving the MCU forward with a great outing!"
Problematic,"I wish the multiverse actually existed because that would mean there's a universe out there where I didn't see this movie.

I used to think Sam Raimi was hard done by because he didn't get to Spider-Man 3 the way he wanted. Now I know it's because he's literally insane.

This movie served no purpose."
Worst marvel movie ever,"Huge dislike for this BS. Guys plz, If you running out of ideas please don't make sitty movies like this. I'm a huge fan of marvel but this movie dissapointed me to not to watch any marvel movie from theater from today.

After endgame and iternals you guys running out of ideas.

Visuals are 9/10 though. But story is 4/10

this is just a remake of 'What if'"
Not worth watching,
Scarlet Witch in the Multiverse of Madness,"I'm going big with an 8 and I would even give it a 9 because I will definitively watch this movie again.

Sadly, Disney makes things its own way and for that reason, you should have watched the slow burn Wanda Vision series to appreciate the film even more, which is a handicap... not to mention the obvious very liberal scenes that you can't miss now in every Disney feature.

Was this movie really about Dr. Strange? I'm approximately 50-50 on that. The serious part of the film will grow old much better: The Scarlet Witch storyline."
Good introduce to multiverse,"Good introduce to multiverse, even though I expected more. The script is kind of shallow, but worth to introduce a little more of multiverse and new characters. I believe marvel has something big to do with multiverse and this is just the begging.

Positive points includes, of course, a well done fan service and the consequences of Wanda getting Darkhold in WandaVision.

Bad points is Convenience of the script, which not only makes the story lose some of its luster. Also, the story felt very rushed."
Meh.,Honestly I already believe that you can do great things with CGI. And I do appreciate Benedict C - elsewhere! A huge waste of time imho. Maybe I need to read more comics again for all the twists and turns to make sense.
"How, just how do people like this","Unless you are one of those marvel super fans I really don't recommend spending money on this film... that's really all I have to say to be honest. Just disappointing, the average demographic marvel films are for just keeeeeeps decreasing. This is supposed to be a 'horror' film but uhm... well let's just say this probably would scare 7 years olds. Secondly the story is just soooo flat and boring not interesting at aaaall. The effort put into this film is just very low, plus people keep saying the acting saves this film. Honestly honey I don't think so."
Doctor Strange in the Wandaverse of Madness,"I don't know what to say about this one. To me personally, this movie still felt really good. I realize there's some inconsistencies in the writing, but story wise, it's still good. I enjoyed it. Maybe it's because I'm just a simple minded person who doesn't constantly questioning every decisions that the writers have made. What can I say? Ignorance is bliss. Don't you miss the old days, when not every person on Earth is a movie critic? Criticizing every step you've made. Back then everything was so black and white. Personally I think this movie is still better than Doctor Strange's first movie. Especially when they throw Charles Xavier into the fold. That's a bold choice. I expect more from the future MCU movies! And I can't wait for your next masterpiece."
Big Yikes!,"Not even close to the first one! Everything was wrong with this movie, from the random guitar riffs to the characters introduced. Just an embarrassment to the character that is Dr. Strange."
Wanda in the Multiverse of Happiness,"The genre of this movie is horror-comedy. In a near future, this movie will eventually be renamed, and be called ""Wanda in the Multiverse of Happiness. Victoria Alonso knows it. Sam Raimi knows it. Michael Waldron knows it. And I know it :) PS: Thank you for the second post credits scene :D."
"""Wandavision the Movie""","Another appropriate name for the movie can be ""America Chavez and The Scarlet Witch co-starring Doctor strange"". It's funny how a character can play third fiddle in a movie that's named after him. What do you expect though, it's Disney. I wasn't surprised, and sad to say I pretty much expected it. They did an absolutely horrible job of combining the different marvel universes as well. Please Disney, just let the MCU rest in peace. While you're at it, please stop destroying Start Wars as well! Disney has the mentality of telling us what we like, instead of giving us what we like."
An omelet with everything on it.,There should be a clause that if you don't like a movie within 15 minutes you can get your money back. Disney just keep on making scrambled eggs and giving people omelet with everything on it.
This movie is so amazing.,Believe me guys this movie is so amazing that I couldn't believe my eyes when I was in theater. So don't trust the haters's word who give this movie rating 1/10. I would give this movie 100000/10 if I could.
What a disappointment!,"Film had it's positives like the touch of horror, going into the multi-universe, you also can never go wrong with Dr. Strange. But, and that's a big BUT! The visuals were a bit off and the cameos were such a waste. 10 minutes of the film, felt as though a was watching a Quentin Tarantino film, and not in a good way. To Sam Raimi, what did you do? You completely ruin a character who was given the best character development in the MCU and crapped all over her. Wandavision made us fall in love with a character we cared very little about. This film should of been a continuation of her story with her struggling with her demons, instead we got a one note villain. She was just too evil, all the emotion and humanity was gone. I left the theater feeling like a had just broken up with the most amazing boyfriend. So sad. I thought I was going to watch this film 3-4 times in theaters, 1 is enough for me."
Movie not found,"Could not infer which age group they gave tried targeting.

Story and visuals look like they're meant for 5yr olds, but then there is violence. For adults, is cringe.

Trumpet and orchestra plays for 5-6 mins before someone speaks a short line. Then, orchestra follows.

Watched it for free, but I should be paid for it."
A major flaw they didn't seem to think about?,
The multiverse of madness is a SMASH,
"Has its moments and is visually gorgeous, but the screenplay is lacking! [+62%]","The refreshing aspect here is Sam Raimi's goth-horror take on the visuals. There are a couple of Sam Raimi's signature jumpscares alongside a fun Bruce Campbell cameo. But the screenplay can't match up to his vision - it's, at times, too simple (like the antagonist's motive is weak) and convoluted (with the multiverse narrative) at others. The MCU cameos ultimately end up not meaning much since they already establish that all characters have their distinct versions in other universes, and the resolution to the film's central problem isn't as smooth as I'd have liked. Elizabeth Olsen is certainly having fun playing Wanda/Scarlet Witch, while Cumberbatch occasionally takes a backseat for the former's arc to play out.

The standout scene was certainly the takeover of Kamar-Taj. It's visually epic, and supported by stupendous production design and CGI. The climactic set-piece, on the other hand, looks a bit watered down - maybe due to the horror elements present. The 2-hour film almost breezes past, leaving almost no room for subplots. It expects the viewer to have watched No Way Home and WandaVision, so they don't have to explain the current state of affairs all that much. The mid-credits scene intrigues with a key character addition, though I'm not sure it adds a lot of excitement."
Very Strange Movie.,
What a big pile of garbage.,"Pretty sure all the good writers are long gone. Hollywood can't make anything that does not involve some type of attempt at grooming kids now a days. It's a shame, they have fallen so hard."
OMG TO THE VISUALS AND MUSICS.,I loved it! I knew that there will be not too many cameos so my expectations were low and that is why i love it. Could have been better but this is classic Marvel. They always ruin the potential.
As bad as Black Widow,
I think this is really about a mom in distress,
Life is strange,
Uh... what?,"This is Marvel's latest (and most flawed) attempt at giving fans exactly what they ""want."" Although certain aspects of the film had potential, almost every part of the film was poorly executed.

If you are expecting this movie to feel like the trailer, you will be disappointed."
Good but not great,"They sure could've explored more the multiverse, this movie had a huge potential.

Felt like this was Wanda's movie not Doctor Strange's. Visual effects were great tho and it sure gave us a horror movie vibe leaving the Marvel formula behind.

However, plot could've been better explored, this movie was too short and it could've gone deeper into many topics."
"They did wanda dirty, when it is not even here movie","The movie totally undid the Wanda's arc in Wanda-Vision

Great visual, great fights, I noticed Sam's Raimi alot of his horror movie elements (the way he direct's horror scene's) but he did not even watch Wanda-Vision show, look at the disrespect.

Just watch ScreenCrush video ""The Problem With Wanda's Story in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" and you will know what I mean

director Sam Raimi did not even watch wanda vision."
If you are a Trekkie.....,
"Are you happy? No, i'm bored.","Great plot was never a distinctive feature of Marvel movies. But it seems in this movie, scriptwriter forgot to do his job. Absolutely lazy and boring movie.

Dr. Strange/Benedict Cumberbatch is playing just like always so no beef.

Wanda Maximoff/Elizabeth Olsen - well, meh. I don't like what this character turned into.

Wong/Benedict Wong - who the f* send actor to clown courses?

America Chavez/Xochitl Gomez - the most boring character of all marvel movies. No acting, no charisma. Director or producer turned this movie into preparation for her solo film.

Marvel phase 4 becoming more and more dissapointing."
"Dimensional hopping visual grandeur with a great plot, but too much reliance on the wider MCU.","The film's a bit all over the place, but that's to be expected with a dimension hopping plot. The different themes the plot explores are good and hold it all together, although it does rely on prior knowledge of the characters and the TV shows a little too much. The multiverse also allows for lots of visually spectacular scenes, great special effects and inventive fight scenes. The acting and characters are good with some strong cameos, although some do feel a bit forced and although a slightly darker style, it still manages some humour."
Enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to,
Impressive New Direction,"Hope all further MCU movies contain a more serious tone: one with humanity, soul and honest emotional power. This is no Logan but I love that it has those more genuine elements in its story. Formulaic movies are a form of escapism I can get behind sometimes but the superhero genre can be much more than that and I believe it should be."
+1 for Originnality,"First gave a 7, then changed to an 8 for such an original approach to a Marvel Film.....Noticing a trend with ""Large Godzilla like Monsters"", not my favorite but okay...."
I don't get the criticism,"Sam Raimi has been quoted as saying they cut 40 minutes because they were concerned it was too long. Depending on what was cut, they could maybe have left it in. The movie is very fast paced and didn't feel anywhere near 2 hours. I'd have liked more of the multiverse, and some of the scenes could have been expanded. That's probably my biggest criticism. Overall, it's still an excellent film. The only significant character addition is Gomez as America Chavez, and she's superb, particularly for a young actress who doesn't have much film experience. She's incredibly likable and makes you care about her character. The other major actors are familiar faces and do their usual amazing job. The visuals and effects are incredible, even better than the first Doctor Strange, and possibly some of the best in the MCU. Not only are they very well done, but there are also some that are unique, particularly within the MCU. I was especially impressed with the rendition of Gargantus, much more realistic looking than the B movie quality of the starfish monster in Suicide Squad. The creators at VFX have stated they began working on it nearly a year and a half before the movie's release, and it shows. Additionally there's a scene of Wanda crawling out of a shield that is uber creepy and a scene of 2 versions of Doctor Strange battling with music notes that is truly inspired. There are many many others, but I don't want to give too much away. Then there's the actual story, which is, even in a blockbuster, an important part. I've seen people complaining the movie is more about Wanda than Doctor Strange (it's not) and that it didn't continue from the first Doctor Strange. Did these people know nothing about the movie before seeing it? They've been saying for months that it was changed because of COVID delays, releasing Spider Man before, when it was originally scheduled after, and the series released on Disney+. They've also said it would pick up from where Wanda Vision left off. Additionally, a lot has happened within the MCU since the first Doctor Strange, so it makes sense his story would have to be adjusted. I'll admit the story was different from what I was expecting (I don't want to say how as that would spoil it), but it was still a good story. My biggest disappointment was it didn't involve Loki. But it has many of the elements of a good comic book story. For starters, it's a very human story. Part of it is heartfelt, and part of it is tragic. There's also character growth for all of the main characters. There's redemption and sacrifice. There's even a memorable quote by our favorite wise man in the wheel chair that may well become iconic. There are complex themes, and it leaves us with larger questions to discuss. However, some of it is subtle, it's not in your face or spoon fed like so much of what's coming out of Hollywood these days. I personally appreciate that. It is not a movie about a cursed book, and the inclusion of that book in the movie has nothing to do with Sam Raimi directing. The Darkhold is simply a plot device, one lifted directly from the comics and which was introduced to the MCU in Wanda Vision. It is violent, as are most comic book movies. Oddly I've seen criticisms it was too violent for the MCU or not violent enough for Sam Raimi. Though it's the first in the MCU to be classified as horror, I honestly don't see how it garnered that classification. I didn't notice that much of an increase in violence between this movie and Avengers Infinity Wars/Endgames. It's not scary, and there's certainly no blood or gore. There is an animated corpse and a few of what Strange refers to as the souls of the damned, so maybe that was it. As for Sam Raimi, yes he's famous for the Evil Dead films, but he also directed the Toby McGuire Spiderman trilogy and The Great and Powerful Oz. Despite the corpse scene, which incidentally wasn't his idea, this is much closer to his Spiderman than Evil Dead. Why anyone would except anything else I can't imagine. He was hesitant to do the corpse scene, but I'm glad he did. It's both an incredible visual scene and an ingenious solution to a problem Strange faces. Like the fight with music notes, it's unique, out of the box thinking, something we haven't seen a thousand times before. Overall I think this film is very well done and well worth seeing. As for the criticism, I've come to the conclusion recently that there are just a lot of people who like being negative and probably never post a positive review."
America's power must be drained to save the universe.,"Now that we have got to see behind the curtain at the evil corporation that owns Marvel by way of leaked Zoon calls. I saw some interesting 'theories' that are present in this film. I tuned out most comic book movies a few years ago but took my 13 year old son. There was noting too gratuitous to scare him which was nice. Having a character in the film named 'America' led to some interesting dialog, ""America is running out of time', ""we need to take America's power"". The connection to the real life satanic led evil corporate owners not lost on me. As well, the use of a secret group in the film that controls things called the 'Illuminati' was a little to on point. Lastly, if the scene of the satanic witch Black Widow trying to sacrifice the character 'America' doesn't tell you Mickeys evil overlords ain't hell-bent on destroying western society your not paying attention. Their message is loud and clear."
Thw worst Marvel Movie ever,"I've never seen such a bad Marvel movie. The movie is a mix between GOT, The walking dead, Harry Potter and Sabrina the teenage witch but in a bad way. Awful."
Marvel movie #48365,
Not at all expected.,"Being a die hard long term Marvel fan,I was utterly disappointed.

Marvel went totally out of the track in this Sam Raimi directorial it seems,which was more like baseless and illogical.

At all times it seemed like an unnecessary lengthy chaotic mess!

Acting was good,rest everything was out of its place. I want talk about the story as it might be the spoiler!

All I would say is after Spiderman No Way Home,I thought it gave a huge opening for this Doctor Strange Sequel,but unfortunately Marvel couldn't utilise the opportunity and it resulted in a big big disappointment in everyway.

It really should have been named ""Conjuring 4"" for adding all that horror elements which wasn't required."
Lizzie is the queen,
Below Marvel's Potential,
Dr Turd,Yeah this movie sucked from the get go. It is filled with non stop jibber jabber and makes zero sense in some places. A complete stain for Marvel and goes down as one of the worst yet. For the love of Zeus's butthole please don't make another sequel. Speaking of buttholes this flick was nothing more than a warm moist turd with a touch of steam. Next...
Scarlet Witch ft. Dr.Strange,"Dr. Strange was almost utterly useless in this movie.

Ideal name should be the multiverse of uselessness.

And Scarlet Witch is shown too OP, which sort of gets boring as Dr. Strange was simply trying to run away from her.

One of the weakest in Marvel's universe."
Meaningless madness in the pursuit of biological motherhood,
"Nearly fell asleep, silly story",
Lame!,"The convenience of making a movie that includes the multiverse in the storyline is that you can make up any old rubbish and say ""it's from another timeline, so it's legit!"" This is the most disappointing Marvel movie since the original Hulk movies."
"Not bad, but not good",
"""A thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.""","Vision said that in ""Infinity War."" So it is with the MCU. Let's accept it. They had a solid 10+ year run with over 20 very entertaining movies with mostly good scripts. But now, Thor The Dark World--once panned for its bottom of the barrel script--is now joined by these latest installments from Marvel Studios. Indeed, it would appear that the machine that thrilled us for over a decade has ground to a halt like a murder-bot without juice. Having taken its historic run of successes for granted and accepted any hackneyed storyline and script as acceptable for its multi-billion dollar fanbase. This fan wonders; was there ever a discussion in some boardroom where someone said: ""Michael Waldron? Really? Do we really want to trust our huge fan base to his FIRST movie script?"" OR, ""Isn't Sam the same horror movie director who 14 years ago pretty much sank our most popular character, Spider-Man?"" Perhaps the exec who thought these things was sitting next to Baron Zemo who promptly silenced them. Who can know what goes into toppling an empire? But the crumble is on full display. Vision, it appears, was right. It was beautiful, but it had to end someday."
Meh...,
"Interesting, fun, multiversal","Interesting, fun, multiversal, but I feel like the whole MCU should have ""rebooted"" with the snap of IronMan's finger rather than trying to explore more and more stories with ever-aging superheroes (Kudos to America for bravely sporting the LGBTQA+ colors though)."
"Dark, brooding dive into the dark & mystic arts","'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' (Dr Strange 2) feels odd in a few ways, as it's been six years since the first film, but we've seen so much of Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) recently, in the last two Avengers films and 'Spider-Man No Way Home', where he was almost the co-lead. This is also a bit different, as it dips slightly into horror territory, with demons, monsters and zombies - it is directed by Sam Raimi, from the original Spider-Man films, but also 'Evil Dead' fame.

The plot follows new character America (Gomez) and her teleporting power and what that has to do with Strange, Wong (Wong) and Wanda (Olsen). This film follows along the lines of what happened in 'WandaVision', 'Loki' and 'No Way Home', so it should be no surprise to viewers with all the interdimensional hopping, magic and psychedelic ""other worlds"" in this film. It's good to see some of the alternate Strange's and the other characters they chose to show us.

While not actually horrific or scary - even though there's a few minor-shocks - it's certainly quite dark and tragic, with the Scarlet Witch storyline being quite well-done, even if it leaves little room for humour or fun. It's good to have McAdams back and she gets some screentime. Cumberbatch is good, but Olsen practically carries the film. The score is good, the CGI top-notch as always and the plot not too indecipherable. As always, there's two end credit scenes."
Yall wanted her to be the bad guy.......,
"Good mix of funny, scary, exciting...","We loved it. It's a Marvel superhero movie that feels more fun and interesting. It has just the right mix of cheese, scary or gruesome, action, and things that make you feel a bit sad. I loved the costumes and music and seeing a lesser known and younger character from the comics (plus some nice cameos). I did get a bit annoyed at Wanda's take on motherhood, but if you think about it from the perspective of someone who has had a total mental breakdown then it makes sense. I felt like the main actors were really engaged and the whole thing was fun."
Absolute disaster,"The reviews that called this movie - boring, a consulted mess, garbage - really got it right. The only good thing out of this movie was Elizabeth Olsen's acting, everything else was done poorly."
One of the most memorable marvel movies,
why did you do such a stupid thing,
I Enjoyed the Madness of Sam Raimi,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of madness is an exceptionally unique experience compared to the rest of the previous MCU movies.

Director Sam Raimi has officially entered the MCU and with him he has brought his unique horror touch. The merging of the two Horror and Superhero universes is something that I did not know I wanted, but I'm glad to have received it. Even though I am not a big fan of the Horror genre, I really enjoyed the elements used by Sam in his movie.

After the events of No Way Home, where Doctor Strange opened the door way to the multiverse, things are no longer as straightforward as they used to be and the bill has finally come due.

So we get introduced to a young girl named America Chavez, who apparently can travel from verse to verse in the multiverse. And with great power comes, a great villain who wants those powers, which is the McGuffin of the movie.

Unlike most Marvel movies, this one is not as much character driven, but instead is more MacGuffin driven. That somewhat takes away a bit from the movie, but thankfully does not impact the overall experience of it.

Wanda who is recovering from the events of WandaVision, is entangled into this madness. How, I will not say, as that would be spoiler territory. What I would say instead is that if you haven't watched WandaVision on Disney+, you better watch it before you go see this movie, because otherwise you will be a bit lost with her plot line.

Multiverse Madness has some great cameos, some already spoiled by the trailer, but also others that I was happy to have enjoyed while watching the movie.

The BGM is also exceptionally well done. Especially in this one scene where Doctor Strange is fighting a certain someone in one of the multiverse. The CGI and VFX are of course state of the art. Given that we are in Doctor Strange's movie, some of the set pieces are exceptionally mind bending to say the least.

Cinematographer John Mathieson, together with Sam, have had a lot of fun colliding the two worlds of MCU Doctor Strange magic and Sam Raimi's jump scare fear, without being full on Evil Dead. The end result is a satisfying one for us the viewers.

This movie is a much needed change in the MCU pace in my biased opinion. I am now ready for more deep cut Marvel characters to be introduced in the future movies.

P. S. - There is a mid-credit scene and a post credit scene."
"Great visuals, terrible everything else.",
Poor writing,If you actually read daily and can identify poor writing-you'll pick up pretty quickly that this is embarrassingly juvenile. We were extremely disappointed in this film.
A perfect sequel to Doctor Strange & Wandavision.,
What Walt's Watching,"Jump into the multiverse of ""Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness"".

It's come a long way since the 1978 ""Dr Strange"".

In 2022, even Benedict's are multiplying in the multiverse...'cos you've got Cumberbatch and Wong in the same movie sharing the same christian name.

Cumberbatch attempts to team up with a witch named ""Wanda"" played by Elizabeth Olsen, his own mothers real name, otherwise known as the ""Scarlett Witch"".

Xochitl Gomez makes her big screen debut as an orphaned teenager named ""America"" who wears a very patriotic denim jacket complete with Stars and Stripes.

Gomez will be familiar to fans of the Netflix series, ""The Babysitter's Club"".

It's a very unsubtle political statement to ""Save America"" and now we are talking the nation not the girl in a post Trump USA era.

""Evil Dead"" director Sam Raimi couldn't help himself by going back to his origins with some of the characters and creatures he is famous for creating plus the odd cameo from long time collaborators in his filmography.

That's not a spoiler because its even in the trailers and posters now.

His touch of horror uniquely works in this storyline.

In fact, this is the first MCU film to be released under the ""Horror"" genre.

Despite the horror elements it is still only a hard PG-13 film, so it's safe to take your children if they are used to violence and gore in movies.

This ""Doctor Strange"" movie has ties to not only ""Wandavision"", but also ""Loki"", ""What If"" and of course ""Spider-Man No Way Home"".

There's a nice touch which might otherwise go unnoticed of showing a famous classic Disney film playing at Wanda's house from ""Wandavision"" now that the Mouseketeers own Marvel.

It certainly helps to have watched that series on Disney plus streaming and the others I've listed above.

You'll be wishing you'd subscribed...so it all makes sense and doesn't send you into the madness of this action, adventure, fantasy, horror flick.

The plot is pretty complex, how much time have you got?

The storyline is full of MacGuffins...those devices used to motivate the characters and plot in a film.

Thanks Alfred Hitchcock for coining that cute phrase and giving Raimi an excuse to add half an hour to the movies runtime.

At one point a group of people in one universe use a funnily familiar name for their organisation that has recruited some wonderful cameos in their bizarre world that had fan boys and girls in cosplay cheering at my advance screening.

Watch out for: A one eyed tentacle monster that looks like it came straight off the set of ""The Suicide Squad"" and has the same Achilles Heel.

Plus there's a nod to the LGBTQ community in one scene.

Stay for the 2 post credit Easter eggs to see where this is all headed in the sequel and for a laugh because there wasn't enough humour in this movie even though Raimi was running the show and we know he loves slapstick.

I'm hoping somewhere in the multiverse a better edit of this movie exists that's only 90 minutes long and saves us seeing one more Marvel Superheroes vs cliched Super Villains scene using the same old CGI and SFX...otherwise it's an entertaining night out only at the cinema with a movie full of star power."
I want to warn myself in other universes don't watch this movie!!!!!,"One star for Benedict Cumberbatch, another one is for Elizabeth Olsen. I can't understand why director let Dr. Strange became a horror movie?? And what is that ""America"" girl for? Everything is so awkward. She is just keeping her mouth open for the whole movie!!!

One of the worst superhero movies out there!!!

I watched Dr. Strange 1 for 6 times, this one? I don't want to watch it again!!!!

I miss old avengers!"
Disney went woke and should go broke,What a disappointment. Disney should focus on movies and stop the political bs. It's sickening how they have destroyed such great potential with woke nonsense.
Pretty good,"Can't imagine Dr Strange is anyone's favourite Marvel character. And the whole multiverse thing is at risk of overdoing it. But with Sam Raimi at the helm, this second stand alone strange movie has turned out pretty decent.

Elizabeth Olsen really steals the show and is really what drives the plot and makes it more than a CGI mess. Though there is as much overuse of CGI as usual. With some random horrible actions scenes (a fight with musical notes?) in there with the good stuff. Sam Raimis style really gives the movie a cool look. I was loving some of his references, and there is fun to be had with the multiverse stuff.

But it starts getting pretty dumb as it nears a close, with a horrible ending and useless midcredit scenes. Good fun. But definitely not for everyone."
Could had been so much better,
WORTH SEEING ...FELT ENTERTAINED,
It was strange,
Just couldn't put it together..,"Pacing was bad. Writing was aight. The idea was there but they couldn't connect the dots nicely.

The directing was a bit inconsistent. Some of the camera angles were questionable to say the least.

Unique things that we haven't seen before in a mcu movie such as the horror elements, Visuals definitely looked strange at times, wasn't consistent, sometimes it was gorgeous and amazing while other times it lacked authenticity.

The characters were solid I guess. Though I wished we knew more about America since she is like one of the main characters in the movie.

Overall a semi enjoyable film.

"""Multiverse"" movie is really worst.","""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" What a time wasting?. I think this movie has very bad plot. It not interesting. I feel boring when I watch this movie. ""Graphic"" like a cartoon. This movie not like ""avengers"". I think now is the time end this mcu multiverse. This movie destroyed ""avengers"" demand. Think back and make some strong movie. Don.t give up."
"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022, Sam Raimi) Decent but disjointed, and not the momentous event I was hoping",
bah.. turned it off after 10 minutes,
Dr Strange Will Return...,"Multiverse of Madness packs a punch by giving the audience exhilarating action scenes that would surely entertain everyone watching. They've got plenty of creative juice deploying every trick of the mystical arts and witchcrafts in such a quirky way. Adding to this is the horror theme that amplify the mystic elements surrounding the world of Dr Strange. Sam Raimi directed Evil Dead and for those who are familiar with his work, you could really sense a vibe of his renowned horror film. And talking about horror, if you're a big fan of Evil Dead or IT: Chapter 1 & 2, you'll love this. They make use of bizarre visuals to mess with your brain and elevate the experience by utilizing jumpscares that may shock younger viewers.

Sam Raimi really did capture the art of modern cinematography and I love that there's a sway or wave of movements with how he or the ASC holds the camera to produce such enigmatic motions.

No one could have played Scarlet Witch as awesome as Olsen. Her transformation from a lovely mother figure to someone who's evil and depressed is really convincing, I even symphatize with her. Her nuances of emotions when she speaks really brings her character to life. Dr Strange, like his name, is well... Strange-r. His character has become more complete and wholesome compared to where he was when he first came to the MCU. But his character is somehow used in a way as a device to further tell the story of the multiverse instead of making him a real superhero character. I didn't feel much excitement seeing him this time.

Making her debut appearance in Marvel, America Chavez has an interesting backstory with a huge potential of being likeable by the audience but... they made a mistake by not introducing her earlier in the franchise, putting her character at stake as she's responsible for carrying the whole movie with Dr Strange & Scarlet Witch. The problem here lies on her story where it's too rushed and not appropriately established, resulting in a disengagement of the audience with her. Marvel should have prolonged this film to a 3-hour focusing on her or made a mini-series about her on Disney Plus or at least, an episode of Marvel's What If...?.

The biggest problem with Dr Strange 2 is it doesn't maximize its potential to utilize the 'multiverse' concept properly. This is supposed to be bigger than No Way Home. Heck, should have been the biggest of all, putting Infinity War and Endgame behind. But the result was moderately disappointing. They didn't fully put their heart and soul to making this film and understanding the demands. Yes, the film is good but by the end, you'll think, 'that's it?'

Here's the thing, the first Dr Strange caught me off guard because of how gigantic the visual scope was presented on the screen. It's a visual-gasm movie. However, with the success of the first film and with the gripping 'multiverse' concept as the focal point, audience's expectation is off the roof. Dr Strange In the Multiverse of Madness suffers from the extravagant title that fails to live up with its hype.

Is it Multiverse enough? Barely. You'd expect the film will jump into so many different universes. Well, expect less... very less 😂. The low-budget Everything Everywhere All at Once shows us even more universes than this. And when they did stuck in a universe, that universe wasn't interesting enough.

Is it Madness enough? Quite. There's a certain level of madness to it but deciding 'Multiverse of Madness' as its title is mind-boggling. It's just not and that's a fact. The title would be better off 'The Madness of the Witch'.

The film is messy enough with a lot of terms and subplots that are not clearly explained or provided a justification for existing. Particularly in the third act, everything happened quickly as they try to explain major things that led to what have happened throughout or navigate the things that are happening without putting much effort into its weightage of storytelling.

A lack of cameos was what killed me. It's THE multiverse? Why not use this opportunity to have dozens of cameos appear? It only takes 1 sec for a beloved character to appear and audience would have been happy. But they didn't make this happen. They felt it's better to show every cameo in TV Spots and trailers and put a stop at surprising fans with more.

For a multiverse film, I was underwhelmed with how the VFX looked like. I'm not sure the reason being the budget or the scope or the lack of experience or understanding of the direction given by the head VFX to the team, but it's mediocre for a mega film that is previously known for its success of its VFX. Truly, Everything Everywhere All at Once has better VFX with only a team of 5-7 people.

Even the transition mostly is downright awful, felt like it could've been better and more polished.

There's a certain tone of cheesiness that I felt this movie could have thrown it out and replaced it with something more solid or ominous as it brings in the horror genre for the first in MCU. There were times the tone reminded me of Garner's Elektra and Affleck's Daredevil that turned me off once in a while.

Verdict: Somewhere in other universe, Dr Strange In the Multiverse of Madness might be the best MCU film ever made but in ours, it is a letdown for such a colossal film. Luckily, the witch casts a spell resulting in a film that is entertaining to watch."
Overall just bad,
"Shallow boring plot, could have been one of the greatest ... #ScottDerricksonCut",
"DO NOT expect ""endgame"" from a 2nd solo film","I honestly, honestly don't get the hate train. It's like 1 bunch of people started ""it's trash"" and others' just going along??

First of all, please watch watch Wandavision atleast before watching this. Cz otherwise you won't connect or understand her at all. That show is brilliant and change your whole idea about her.

Secondly, why people were expecting everything multiverse related to be introduced in it??? It's not a mega film like ""endgame"" ""infinity war"" ""the avengers"" no. It's a doctor strange film. And if they keep it up its going to be the most fabulous triology in the MCU.

Both strange and Wanda (screaming) did so so so great. America Chavez was also really good I like her.

I couldn't think of anything else throughout the whole movie it will keep you on your toes and chills every moment. The cinematography is spectacular.

Just enjoy the film instead of scrutinizing and being judgemental. It's a solid piece 10/10."
Spectacular performances for a short runtime!,"The movie was an immense treat. Dr. Strange, along with all the other Marvel characters are ones that go through their respective character developments in every Marvel film they appear. Dr. Strange at this point in time , was just asking for a little adventure rather than development , while Wanda was the character about to go through one of the most important segments of her life. And , honestly, despite the critical pacing due to the short runtime, the movie was executed really well. I'm pretty sure anyone else in Sam Raimi's place would have definitely failed to deliver the movie the way it was. The Scarlet Witch was brutally glorious. The tonal shift from several Marvel movies was unexpected and absorbing. All the horror elements blended really well with the characters the way it was supposed to. America Chavez was absolutely lovable! Just as much as how Kate Bishop entertained us!"
Madness!!,"The MCU continues to find a way to stay fresh, utilizing the multiverse and it's endless possibilities. It's jaw-dropping, dark, creepy and visually epic. Great acting. This is Wanda's film. Hats off to Sam Raimi for doing such a great job. Expect the unexpected. 💫🔥"
Stan lee is disrespected and it's a disgusting movie,
The story is interesting but,The movie is like a combination of different movies - horror/cult/hero movie? Some scenes were so cringy and made me laugh... the actors are really really good tho. I hope Disney don't interfere with the Marvel movies so much.
Visually stunning and decently enjoyable,"I haven't liked a single Marvel project since Spider-Man: Far From Home in 2019. Everything post FFH was plagued with horrible writing that prioritized winking at the audience more than telling a compelling story. So going into Doctor Strange, I was pretty much expecting the movie to be a certain way based on how Marvel movies have been lately. And having watched the movie now, I feel like it was the best case scenario of what I thought it would be.

The writing was still a little poor and lazy, but it didn't feel extremely dumb as in some of Marvel's previous projects. The movie kept me engaged throughout and I never felt bored once. Thanks mainly to the actors, who are now almost always bound to give us an amazing performance, as well as the stunning visual language of the film. Seeing as how the first Doctor Strange movie elevated this chaotic visual language, it only made sense to expect the sequel to be even better, and it was.

Plot wise however, there's nothing much to say. We have a multiverse now. Meaning that anything can be done because, why not? It's a basic multiverse plot with nothing new, and a pretty lame climax. But it didn't bomb horribly, and that is quite an achievement for Marvel today (in my opinion, of course).

Overall, it was decently fun. The visuals alone were certainly worth the visit to the theatre. But it has nothing new to offer despite some cameos that are just as much a Marvel staple now as is their bad writing."
They mislead us with the title and trailers but the movie was entertaining nonetheless,"The way they advertised this movie, people seem to have built up an expectation of seeing the multiverse being wide open and the characters diving into different universes, meeting different versions of them, having a bunch of cameos and chaos all around. Whilst they did indeed spent some time in few of those universes, it seemed very short a time for a title like ""Multiverse of Madness"". There weren't too many cameos either.

But I think spending time only on few universes prevented the plot from becoming a complete mess. It also helped us settle in those universes, sink into them and care for them. It made the story fleshed out.

The title should have been ""Dr Strange vs The Scarlet Witch"" or a cooler one but definitely not ""Multiverse of madness""

The movie was entertaining all around. I enjoyed every second of it. Nice, engaging story with some horror elements."
"Dark, mysterious but messy, annoying and pointless",
Elizabhet Olsen is so scary in this movie Thanks Sam Raimi,
Thats probably the worst movie i ever saw,
Completely overdone,They wanted to put too much of everything into one movie and thus it became quite disengaging and even at times boring and definitely too long. The story itself could have been told in 90 mins.
Are you happy? - Not very much,
Cheap version of Loki season 1,"Took some scenes from Loki season 1 being one of my favourites it's hard to see cheap copy of it in doctor strange.

Very poorly written screenplay confusing scenes no proper dialogues, week graphics easily worst marvel movie."
One of the WORST Marvel movies,
Disney and Marvel have entered B Movie Territory,"Wow just garbage. So boring and uninteresting. If you did not follow the Wandavision soap opera then you will be lost on the point of this movie.

You would think movie stars would have more self respect on allowing a bad film like this to release. It feels like these movies around the multiverse could just be daily or weekly content released on CBS and its Star Trek garbage."
great ad for jaeger lecoultre,"I'll just say that the plot of the film fits in one sentence. Two hours of watching is an absolute waste of time.

Marvel movies don't require concentration while watching, but this is a shame. Such a team of people, resources to make this garbage."
Felt like a fun fever dream,"This movie was weird and felt like 5 different films merged in one... but I had a such a fun time watching it I HAVE to give it a 10.

It had me at edge of my seat the whole time. I screamed, I laughed, I cried. I can't remember the last movie that captivated my attention like this.

The cinematography and sound design were also unreal.

Don't get me wrong, the movie has its faults; the pacing, the story and some of the characters, probably earn it a lower score, but I'm rating solely based on how entertained I was. I'll leave the nitpicking to the film critics."
WOW,
Only Mess,"I wish i could get back 2 hours of my life. There is no plot and no direction.

Marvel used to make good movies but now a days its only mess.

I hope they will make good movies in future."
Headache but a fan of Dr Strange in every Universe,"Sam Raimi is an overrated film maker and a very bad story teller

And not being funny movie don't have any spoilers. It just cameo, horror and madness to the next level.

Don't expect anything special from this movie. It's just an average & one time watchable film with a weaker storyline compared to the first part of Dr. Strange movie."
Less Multiverse,"This movie was mostly enjoyable because it was fast paced and gave little to no room for dull/mundane moments.

But it falters because it essentially rehashed a previous Wanda arc and also the Multiverse was given little room for exploration, which could have been helped had the movie been given more time. Everything goes by so fast and while that is a good thing, for a story as ambitious as this, they really should have told it with more detail."
Pretty weird Marvel Movie,"This movie is far away from what you expect and the usual format of a MCU movie, it was pretty refreshing but you don't completely understand if you are seeing a movie which belong to the usual universe, its a good movie but not an excellent one."
This Film Makes Me Mad,"With a title like Multiverse of Madness you go in expecting, well, a Multiverse of Madness. What you will find is a bland mess of a film, the visuals are neat and the direction is possibly up there as some of the best in the MCU but the characters are hollow shells which do nothing except move the film along. The multiverses we'll be travelling to are the INSANE New York with greenery and the EVEN CRAZIER New York but it's somehow even greyer than it usually is. Unless you count a couple seconds showing actually interesting universes this is all of the multiverse we'll be seeing.

Don't worry though, we have these great characters to take us through the story. I can't wait for Doctor lady who turned up for all of 5 minutes in the first film to be revealed as actually important for some reason. Doctor Strange lacks any real character, he sort of develops but it's very small and doesn't amount to much. America Chavez is here. She's a character. I mean it, she steps on the magic exposition dump pavement so we can see her tragic backstory get televised to the world in a shop window. Neat how that worked out and suddenly I care about this girl who hardly has anything to do apart from move the plot along.

The CGI is pretty bad at points, likely due to the fact they have to rush these films out so that everything fits together. I don't like the forced cameos. Really this film over promised and under achieved. Also the villain reveal is so obvious and the motivations just aren't immediately clear unless you have a decent knowledge of multiple other properties and bits of lore.

The maddest thing about this film is that, even with all this said, I still enjoyed it and I'm going to continue watching every one of these movies until I die or the MCU does. Here's to the next 50 years..."
Multiverse riddled with implausible storyline,
Wanda movie with appearances by Strange,"Honestly...I never liked Wanda. I hated WandaVision. And here's a whole movie with her whining about her 'kids' (oh but let's forget about Vision in the other universes because...reasons. Guess she doesn't give a rip about him except when she throws his name out there to try and guilt trip Strange).

Never mind Vision would kill her as a villain and she's everything he fought against. It's ALL SBOUT THE KIDS we have no personal attachment to (random nameless kids seen for ten seconds) but somehow are supposed to view them as her entire reason for ripping the universe apart?

And no sorry Wanda mothers don't ""use magic to make kids"". They use biology. 🙄 That line was so cheese and cringey I couldn't stand it.

Really disappointed."
Average MCU entry with a horror twist.,
Too much CGI and Madness without making sense of story or characters,I was really hoping this movie would be good. Surely it was never going to come close to the Spider man movie but it was a total mess. Sam Raimi is a great actor and I loved his original Spider man movies but this is a total mess. Maybe it is not his fault but of the Disney influence.
Doing too much reshoots makes director confuse,Cant belive worst movie ever from mcu. Too much hyped for this. Since a Mcu fan i cant emotionally attached to this film. Felt like watching unknown movie which has no great moments to feel nd being happy. I dunno why they took too much reshoots that it become more worse. I dont think so im going to watch Thor after this sh** i watched today in theatre.
Like a dream,"Like a dream you're trying to explain and then you realize there's to little plot to make a good story out of it. Not much in the way of character development, but maybe that's what the madness part is all about."
Wow,"Its dark, its wicked and its a cameo fest, and its a film for Marvel fans, some of the casts are a Marvel fan's wet dream, Elizabeth Olsen, most definitely needs to do a House of M film , and both Benedicts are excellent as Dr Strange and Wong. Xochitl Gomez is a scene stealer."
Maybe not an epic but a very good marvel film,"I tend to watch marvel films more as standalone movies and I really enjoyed this one. A very clever plot and a lot packed into 2 hours, rather than needlessly dragging it out to 3 as some tend to.

I am warning to cumberbatch after not liking him previously, his acting is growing on me. I also enjoyed some of the little bits of humour in this film.

A very good film for both big marvel fans and not."
I wanted to love it but...,"There are some really good things about this film, but despite all the possibilities, it was the journey of Scarlet Witch that was my favourite thing. Other than that it was enjoyable but somewhat linear and a bit underwhelming.

I'll be honest, despite how popular Spider-Man 2 was (same director), some of the same things about that film were parts I didn't enjoy about this film. It has some good moments but also some pretty cheesy ones along the way. I love Danny Elfman's music in films like Batman Returns and Edward Scissorhands, but here in places it just felt a bit overdone and matched the kind of cheesy tones of the film. The film itself also felt like it didn't really know it's identity and was something of a long here to there story. It could have been so much more. There were brilliant cameos but they didn't have the kapow excitement you'd hope for in seeing them. Overall I just feel underwhelmed. How many times and for how long will they tease us? Can't we just get on with it now?

I did like it, and history shows when I'm underwhelmed with a Marvel film I usually prefer it on second watch, but I can't say I'm excited to see it again anytime soon. What I can say though, is the way certain cameos were handled leaves me excited for the future - whenever that may be..."
'What If 'Episode 4 was much better...,"This movie broke me. It annoyed me so much that it compelled me to write my first movie review ever.

The 5 stars out of 10 are for all the people and effort that went into making the movie. It was by no means a terrible movie. BUT it should have been far better.

That was the biggest problem. It was soulless.

I kept thinking how the story from Episode 4 of What If was so much better. That story had heart. I felt the weight of it.

When I saw this movie, I felt nothing but disappointment. This wasn't a Dr. Strange movie. It was a Wanda Maximoff movie.

And for heavens sake, the forced Diversity is so distracting. I'm British Asian, and I find the false narrative that we live in utopian society where there is equal representation is everywhere, is just insulting. Please Disney, stop it already.

I love the idea of representation. But it should be proportionate. I feel Iike I'm being trolled when watching these movies. And that lack of realism destroys the suspension of disbelief that it takes for a movie like this to work.

So yeah I was on the whole, very disappointed. They should have gone with the story from Episode 4 of What If and turned that into a full movie. That would have centred on Dr. Strange and had loads of cameo's that made sense and it would have had some emotional weight to it.

I think I'm done with the MCU. There is only so much disappointment one can take. The MCU peaked with Endgame.

And yes, I've seen 'No way home' and 'Into the Multiverse' is a better Spiderman movie."
Average movie #Releasetheraimecut,1st one is far better than this keep your exception low I think movie is directed and edited by kevin feige Screenplay was not up to the mark Its like bites and pieces Movie is dark i am OK with that but lack of clarity and role of Wanda is totally wasted.
MCU gone Nickelodeon,
"Good movie, but not as expected.","It was a very good movie as an independent movie but because of the high expectations and watching the suspenseful clips the whole movie was burn, Directing and story was beautiful but because of the director's haste and trying to reach a movie stronger than a movie avangers endgame and infenity war the movie was spoiler from marvel it self."
Not satisfied,"I don't know why I feel this film is not enough. Especially because it seems that this time they made the film shorter so that it seemed rushed.

I miss the marvel movies that Stan Lee supervised himself."
"Long for no reason, woke and boring",
A fairly unique MCU movie,"A rhythm that catches you from the beginning with a very striking direction and cinematography, this film manages to entertain and go out of the ordinary in the MCU, Wanda is spectacular and stands out above all, but... the cameos feel little worked and the end of the film is feels little brave and that Marvel decided to play it safe without causing much impact on his universe.

I feel that it could be one of the best in the MCU if they had given him more time, even so I consider it a very good movie as long as you don't wait a massive event like Avengers."
Is this a joke?,"Yes, this movie is a joke. Bad acting, bad plot and overal cringe scenes. The attempt to make it a more horror genre was pathetic. Overal cringe movie and as a MCU fan, I am ashamed of this movie and Disney should be too for releasing it."
Barely got through.,"It is very, very rare that I could not finish a movie. The only one I ever could not watch was the last transformers one. This one came close. They tried something here and to me, it utterly failed.

One giant blob of mediocre CGI, God awful storyline and forgettable acting. Only good thing was the horror, it felt nice to see a former hero turn into a monster.

I am afraid to watch Love and Thunder now."
"All Wanda could've done, was to adopt a child in the same universe to avoid 2.5 hours of complete nonsense",
VERY AVERAGE!,"This film should've been named as 'Wanda's Madness in the multiverse', because it was a complete show by her. Infact the story itself a continuation of 'Wanda Vision' series. Doctor Strange played like a second Hero here. Movie has all the extravagant Actions, visuals, making and entertainment same like all top MCU movies... It was a visual treat to Watch. But the Movie missed in the Story and Screenplay. Recently MCU is only doing fan service and not concentrating on the plot.

When Sam Raimi came on board I was so much excited to see his take on new MCU World but they only bought him to carry this lame storyline in his directing Style and narration. He did what he usually do, he bought slightly new tone with dark and jumpscare approaches but it didn't helps to make this average story better. They showed all the Major scenes in the trailer and the clips itself. The one good thing they did was not revealing the Villain anywhere..but in the Movie the villain was revealed in the first few minutes itself and they failed to carry the reason for that. And they didn't use this Multiverse theory properly.

The Problem is scenes looks incomplete and the screenplay is rushed too much. No character development or no character bondings they abruptly jumped to next secenes and rushed the Movie. First Half was entertaining and moved fast and then the later was super boring. To cheer up in the second half they brings the Cameo's but at the next sequence they were all ditched. NWH dealt the same problem but it's survived by the Nostalgic facts but MOM was mostly pointless.

Overall it's an usual entertainment with 'Marvel Formula' but lacks in every other aspects. Disappointed with this output."
A Mess From Middle To End,
No Multiverse Very Little Madness,"All the usual promise by social media hype and via Trailers ...then the film fails to deliver in what feels like a mess of hurried editing and cut short/rushed story telling.

The MCU seems to be desperately struggling post End Game

Constantly now diluted by TV Series which then fail to contribute to the bigger picture. From the OG Avengers Movie phases 2 and 3 built and built on so many levels, often excelling

The current roster struggles with any form of continuity and instead seems to throw out incoherent one shot stories that fail to live up to expectation. Feige and his team are desperately hanging to the coat tails of former glories now to sell us new content.

The next few films slated for release had better start delivering and building to some wider story arc or the same level of fan reaction and dissatisfaction that's until now been reserved for toxic fans of the Star Wars films will shift focus and start to be felt by Marvel Studios

A good film but one that is simply not good enough."
Who is this for?,
"Oh my, so bad","What on earth is this garbage? Quite possibly the worst film I've seen in the MCU, possibly even in a long time.

Terrible plot, incredibly boring and it just feels bad from start to finish."
The longer I think about the movie the less I like it,
Disappointed but good,"This movie is a clear example for bad marketing . The trailers spoiled too much of the movie . When I saw the trailers I thought WOW if this is what they've showed us in the trailers WTF is in the movie I'm sure it's going to be ( Madness ) . Well it wasn't at all .

But if you put that aside , the Movie was good . You will definitely enjoy it . But me personally I was waiting for something great not just good . And I admit it's on me . But even though phase 4 wasn't great . It has refreshing enjoyment Marvel tried new things some were great , some were good , some were bad .

Loki , Wandavision , spider-man NWH , are the best things in this phase so far . Moon knight , Doctor strange M. O. M are on the ( good ) things in this phase so far . Thankfully this movie isn't as bad as Falcon and Hawkeye . At least for me Howkeye was fun unlike Falcon and the winter soldier that show was boring with bad ending ."
In the multiverse of wasted cameos,"Silly how a movie with the word ""Multiverse"" in it's title is less of a multiverse movie than Spider-Man: No Way Home. A big let down.

Of course some reviewers, for a counter-argument in it's defense, are immediately spitting out the so famous quote: ""Keep your expectations low and you will never be disappointed.""

Means that I have to rate it as ""a good movie"" simply because of the terrible advertising that made me have higher expectations than I should have had, regardless of how bad the movie really is. Somehow it's just my fault, that it?

This movie had just a few appreciated cameos, and it felt like they have less than a minute of screen time, and it was the most disappointing. For such wise and powerful veterans they had mind of rookies who are at this like for the first time, hence screwed it all up in the most convenient way.

Made my eyes rolling times too many than it should have been humanly possible.

I'll give it 4/10 cause it stands for ""Poor"" in my rating system. But honest it deserves even less."
It was so good!!!,You know what. After seeing the reviews I thought this movie was going to be bad. But then watching the characters and the acting this movie was one of the greatest. Please don't look at the reviews and don't keep your expectations high.
woke strikes again,Maybe in some other version of the multiverse this could be a good movie. I am ao tired of this latest tred marvel.has with the strong female lead and males are week and useless. Sace your money or just go see a better movie.
A quite nice Dr Strange series worth to watch,"The special effects is average, directorship is average, cast is average, story line is above average, content is above average and this whole movie is not as mind thinking as previous so its not so stressful, haha.

One of the nice movie I watched this month. I can recommended it to watch in cinema.

On the point, I can only give 7.7/10 because its not that excellent yet."
Scarlet Witch is the MVP,
Wanda's kids making it boring. I mean BORING.,"Come on, I think Dr strange is neither a Doctor nor Strange anymore. Each frame - visually is excellent and the Easter eggs but the story! Wanda is doing for her kids and you don't care! You don't want to watch it further with the curiosity.

In my pov, the first version only was the perfect representation of Dr. Strange. Slowly he is being represented as a weak avenger. The concept of Multiverse, as they are specifically making a movie for that concept in mind, could be made much much better. Should also be much more confusing. You have to be confused with such a complex subject. Agreed, some of the last fight sequence was pretty applaudable but the story doesn't hold things up. Wanda's kids and she does all thigs... man! Its nuts. The movie is so simple that feels like it is for some 6 to 12 year kid.

Okay, you can disagree with me."
The Multiverse of Messiness,"I'd like to start off by saying that I have respect for Raimi and the writers for attempting to branch away from the MCU formula. Except they didn't cook a cake from scratch. Instead, they borrowed the same old recipe and added two or three more ingredients.

Doctor Strange is a messy film. The pacing can't make up its mind and the tonality shifts back and forth too quickly to immerse yourself into the movie.

Strange has its moments. The horror element is some of Raimi's best but is quickly overshadowed by campy moments and cheesy one-liners (which we can also credit to Raimi).

Elizabeth Olsen's character, Wanda, is the steel beam that attempts to hold this film together. But sadly it's not enough. Especially when the focus falls on short-lived cameos and newly introduced characters with rushed backgrounds, instead of, well, the character that has his name in the title.

In an ideal world, the writers would've spent more time writing a compelling story instead of giving us something that feels like a whole bunch of ideas on a notepad. Even for a movie about traveling the multiverse, which shouldn't require too many dots to connect, Doctor Strange 2 is constantly all over the place and never stops to figure out what kind of movie it wants to be."
Lame. forgettable. I fell asleep. Skip it.,"This was hugely disappointing. Not a proper sequel to Doctor Strange or WandaVision. Very much geared towards young children, despite the supposedly ""dark"" or ""horror"" content which it did NOT have. The kind of Marvel movie you will never watch a second time, nor mention in conversation to anyone."
Interesting and fun movie,"It was fun to watch also liked the horror in the movie.

Plot was simple, but there was lot to cover since it happens in a multiverse.

Experience is nice when watched from 3D."
"Not Only Exciting, This Film Is Also Heartwarming, As The Characters Show The Viewers The True Importance Of Love.","The thrilling Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, written by Michael Waldron, keeps you on the edge of your seat-you silently root for Dr. Strange as he embarks on the daunting journey to save America Chavez. Not only exciting, this film is also heartwarming, as the characters show the viewers the true importance of love. The acting is emotional and grounded in reality, even though the Marvel world is fantastical. Marvel fans will be fully engaged as they travel through the endless and unknown multiverse with Stephen Strange.

The storyline follows Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) as he tries to save America Chavez's (Xochitl Gomez) powers from being stolen by the indomitable Wanda, the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen.) The unlikely duo must travel deep through the uncharted multiverse in order to defeat Wanda, but along the way, how will Strange and Chavez overcome the seemingly impassable obstacles that they will inevitably face? Wanda just wants her children back, but how much is she willing to sacrifice and destroy in order to return to her content family life?

As usual, Benedict Cumberbatch portrays Stephen Strange's beautiful complexity with ease, making his work seem simple. I forget he is even acting. To me he is truly Doctor Strange. Xotchil Gomez, although new to the Marvel Universe, starts off with a bang. She acts in a relatable and comical way, and it is impossible not to root for her with every step. The CGI is scarily realistic and absolutely essential to the story. The marvelous monsters are gruesome, each universe is unique and colorful, and the fight scenes are powerful-all because of the CGI. The music in this movie, by composer Danny Elfman, makes the action even more dramatic and gives the audience a pump of anticipation and adrenaline. Music even plays a pivotal role in one scene as it becomes a tool and a weapon in battle. My favorite part of the movie is the first time Dr. Strange travels with America to a new universe and experiences wonder and fright and ultimately awe.

The message of this film is that love is the most powerful kind of magic. One may be strong or supernatural, but familial love comes before any other superpower. This message is beautiful, relatable, and uplifting, especially for those of us who miss someone we truly love. The film starts really quickly and immediately draws the viewers into to the plot, but there are many macabre scenes that may be frightening to a younger audience.

I give Doctor Strange, into the Multiverse of Madness 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10-18, plus adults. By Nyara A., KIDS FIRST!"
actual score 8.,
it would have been better to have ended the MCU with Endgame,"Normally I don't write reviews about movies. However, I have to make an exception for Dr. Strange, as it already is the 2nd movie in the MCU that disappoints me.

Marvel has always been a guarantor of entertainment. 2 hours flew by like in a flash. The scripts were outstanding, with the right mix of seriousness, emotion and humor. The interplay was just right. I loved the characters, I loved the Universe.

Now, unfortunately, I have to admit, it would have been better to have ended the MCU with Endgame. Because all the subsequent releases, whether series or movies just don't... fit anymore.

They don't add up to a whole picture. The vision of the Russo brothers. You can tell that Kevin Feige still wants to tell a story, but he has to deal with a whole bunch of different people now. Different directors with their own different visions and opinions. That's a mistake. A big one.

That's why I couldn't connect with Dr. Strange 2. Everything was so gloomy and unrelaxed. So über.

Had it not been part of the MCU, a standalone film, without the hero Dr. Strange, it would certainly be a great film, but with Dr. Strange you associate the Avangers. With Wanda as a partner, not an enemy. No matter in which Universe."
Really?,"Wait...what, my tax payer dollars went into financing this through the Victorian Government's Film Victoria agency?

I would like to apologise to the rest of the world for our part in creating this mess. Sorry guys."
Visually satisfying but the story leaves allot to be desired.,"When it comes to the cinematography and the visual style of this movie it stands out amongst marvel's other films. I would even say it has the best visual style of any of the MCU films.

The problem with the film though is the execution of plot and characters. The plot is loose and has many glaring holes and contrivances. The characters are pretty shallow and have very forced resolutions and motivations.

The film as a whole has allot of great eye candy and designs that will keep you engaged but the lack of meaningful characters and performances really takes you out of the whole experience.

And when it comes the the multiverse and references to other marvel properties...It's not satisfying and you really only get the most surface level look into the multiverse and the characters inside of it.

Incredibly disappointing as a marvel fan but I was able to take away some satisfaction from the fantastic designs and beautiful camera work for some of the more abstract moments."
good not great,"America chavez is such a poopy character and all she does in this movie is scream and run away

shes boring

also just alotta things that dont make sense if u think about it."
"Super enjoyable, but with a lot of flaws and plot holes.",
Eccentric craft,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness absolves messy writing with spunky flavor. Still, the story is cumbersome, protagonists are underdeveloped, and dialogue is unnatural. The plot is straightforward (villains trying to capture a kid), yet there's so much complicated exposition that Multiverse of Madness feels laborious. Plus, that significant groundwork leaves little time to explore the characters. Strange gets some emotional moments and Wanda is powerfully motivated, but that's it. Furthermore, the only actor with enticing material is Olsen. Despite all this, Multiverse of Madness connects because of its trippy elements and heartfelt touches.

Meanwhile, Multiverse of Madness is the most artistic MCU film because Raimi's personality shines through. There is camera movement, suggestive framing, and dramatic lighting. There are beautiful match cuts, striking dissolves, and clever transitions. These techniques set a psychological mood that suits the narrative. Moreover, the sound is complex, symbolic, and creepy. Also, the music heightens adventure and punctuates horror. This is all harmonized by unique direction and production, which cohesively blends clean MCU, bizarre multiverses, and horror undertones. Overall, Multiverse of Madness overcomes its bloated script and MCU ties with fair drama and eccentric craft.

Not bad,"Enjoyed it.

The midpoint reveal is really fun. It gets a bit lost in itself at times, the nods to various horror films are cute if not awkward.

It sets things up nicely in spite of its weird narrative."
Loved it!,I loved it and so the audience in the theatre with me. Sam Raimi Signature everywhere and he doesn't pull back on the horror elements and the level of gore. It was fast paced with fantastic visual and sound effects. Some people were dissatisfied with the climax because it is too similar to Spiderman 2. Never the less this is a fun movie from marvel and a very different attempt on the theme.
Fantasist - helps tie many things together,"This movie was fantastic and simply impressive. The story it self starts of fast from the get go and doesn't slow down.

Doc strange brings together many marvel titles allowing for great and further expansion of the mcu with exisiting franchises and actors.

This movie has a horror feel to it, not jump frights but a horror evil feel never the less.

Mid credit scene is great, end one isn't worth waiting for unless you want a laugh.

All and all this movie delivered and delivered big in my opinion. Definitely sets up the next phase for the MCU."
Mediocre - Kind of Dosappointing,"The Cinematography is very strange, many camera shots, angles, jump, and lighting looks very made for TV and theatrical. Even CGI elements are very off target.

Xochitl Gomez's acting is very subpar for a Marvel Movie. It akin to the acting in The Last Airbender movie.

Much of the film has a very CW production feel to it. The writing isn't very good. Benedict feels like he's phoning it in several times.

The move was not about Doctor Strange, it was more about Wanda and the intro of this new bland character America Chavez.

Overall Extremely Disapponting. Should have been released direct to Disney+"
10 Stars. Best Marvel movie yet,"What more can you ask for? Can't wait to see it in theaters again. Aside from a massively strange casting choice for a character whose initials are RR, this movie keeps you involved. Breaking free of licenses and all the other restraints we've seen in Marvel movies, it was refreshing and satisfying. No holds barred. They find a cool way to do scary/horror without making it too gory or extreme. Love the allusions to the What If? Episode."
Marvel is continuing to lose their movie touch,
What,Definitely below my expectations. I couldn't understand exactly what he was saying. How do they spend so much money and make movies like this? Interesting.
Unbelievably bad,"Not sure it's possible to make this any worse. Writers must be from a bad movie universe. To much cgi, bad plot, weak dialog, ridiculous characters,, nothing good about this. Waste of time. Done with Dr strange!"
"Great visuals, good acting but not a strong plot!!","I watched DSMM at the day of its release, and had high hopes with the movie and director. Although, I am not disappointed but the movie is below my expectations. Its just fighting scenes, with alot of time/multiverse references but no real plot. I felt like I am just watching fights. Visuals of the movie are amazing, acting of Olsen and Benedict is good, but script is kind of loose. Its just like watching Venom Carnage."
It's time to kill the Marvel cash cow,"This movie had a ridiculously boring plot, filled in with fan service that just doesn't work, and has you wanting it to just end already as the 2 hour disaster feels 2.5 hours too long.

Enough already. End this declining Marvel universe already."
A fun and exciting film!,"This movie was so good and the visuals were fantastic. Much darker film than some of the other marvel entries. However, during points in the film I got a little visually overwhelmed with my head starting to ache. That may be due to me watching it in the theater with only the light at the screen. Great film nonetheless. I would watch it again."
Really unexpected cameos!,"#DoctorStrange #MultiverseofMadness told a very different story than what I had in mind. Solid, with horror elements which was decent, but not scary. Was quite disappointed to be the only one gasping at SOME of the most unexpected cameos! And THAT post-credit... Damn! (4/5Scales)"
"Not bad, but not great either","Its worth a watch, but just watch it at home and save $60-70 of taking a date & popcorn/soda.... There are enough people dissecting the plot and story line but I won't bore you with any of that..... just toss some popcorn in the microwave and enjoy the special effects like all the other super hero movies....."
Disappointing,"The whole movie feels so amateurish and nothing like past marvel movies. Definitely didn't feel like a doctor strange movie either. The first one was so epic, this one was so cheesy and felt very early 2000s with the way the scenes cut or faded together. Many spots has music that seemed out of place. Some of the CGI was very obvious and horrible, the ""horror"" factor was extremely cheesy and cringy. Not to even mention the cheap and awful 80 style makeup on a certain character toward the end. Looked like rubber.. We were extremely disappointed and this honestly didn't feel like it was even an official marvel movie."
Sam raimi is freaking genius,"Dir. Sam raimi movies has this taste that i only remember from spiderman trilogy, a unique directing. And an Amazing movie oc I wish we could see more of raimi movies."
Visually impactful !!,"Will not disappoint you... the last act might be not as big as the first part but still, the story keeps a good pace and despite is has many references of a lots of comics all compacted in ""the multiverse of madness"", you never feel like everything doesn't go as part of the same movie. Once and again, this movie gives a lot of what fans wanted and it leaves the door open for more stories from the multiverse. Wanda is a great and powerful ""character"" like we haven't seen and is the most scary movie from marvel... great job from the director. This could be easily taken as a Wanda's movie without overshadowing Dr. Strange. I hope we see more from Wanda.

Wait for the after credits!!!"
It's sloppy.,"Visually striking, thoroughly entertaining and complete with well written characters.

Unbelievably convoluted plot, seemingly not even cohesive. Poor dialogue, some great and terrible acting, bad green screen moments and cheap cameos that leave you wanting more.

It's not Marvels worst, but it's hard to even call this a film. It honestly just feels like a long advertisement for what's next. All of the love and joy of film is sucked out of this one

Coming from a Marvel fan."
Wanda in the Multiverse of madness.,
Loved the giant octopus!,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness: Yet another trek through the Multiverse and Dr strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) has to undertake that voyage if he's to prevent the destruction of his universe and perhaps the Multiverse itself. There's this teen girl, America (Xochitl Gomez) who appears in the Doc's dreams but the events are actually happening in another universe, she then appears in his universe pursued by a giant octopus which Dr Strange battles along with the help of Wong (Benedict Wong), now the supreme Sorcerer in that universe. Things get complicated when Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) goes over to the Dark Side in her Scarlet Witch persona. So the battles continue through assorted universes in search of an Occult Text and Docs galore are revealed, dad, alive, bad, good and in between. Some interesting superhero guests also feature but best not to reveal who exactly. A good fantasy adventure with some dark moments but all is leavened by the strain of humour which permeates the film. Directed by Sam Raimi, written by Michael Waldron. 8/10."
This movie is a give or take for me,
Enjoying it... however...,"Really enjoying it so far, however only 30 minutes in its obvious this should've been a film for Wanda, not Dr Strange. Secondly, the acting is brilliant from everyone, except Xochitl Gomez... why TF would you cast her, I've never heard of her before but she's not even an amateur actor. It's like she's still in drama school and this was the best she could do. Her facial expressions, running, delivery of every line she says are all over exaggerated to the point it dampens how good this film should've been."
Enjoyable,
Doctor Strange 2 is an entertaining and wild ride!,"An enjoyable movie with tons of epic moments, solid fight sequences, an incredible soundtrack, outstanding visuals, and countless jump scares. A great Doctor Strange and Wanda Maximoff story that elevates their character with emotional elements. However, I do wish that we traveled more of the ""multiverse"" in this film and some sequences in the film may be a little too violent for younger audiences (the PG-13 rating is pushed to limits at some points in the film). Other than that I definitely recommend it! In my humble opinion it is better than the first one which I enjoyed very much. I look forward to watching it again soon!"
So weak and bad.,"Save yourself the ticket. It's bad I mean really bad. Unless your 10 or 12. Then it's good. It's like flogging a dead horse.

Why didn't they stop? It's like trying to get your money, just for the nostalgia. The story they is none. The cinematography is great as always from this director.

Better to go watch any of DC line up than this."
Bigger is not always better,"In the past, Marvel was able to create unique films that occasionally stunned, but sometime in the last few years they've lost their touch. It was an interesting decision to bring back Raimi, and it might've been different if they had given him final cut, but I'm just surmising that Disney might've tampered with his vision. There were bright spots, specifically the creative visuals, and the third act that improved upon the previous two. But the flaws overshadowed the majority of the film. I have a slight gripe with the Multiverse infatuation that Hollywood seems to be experiencing right now. As it pertains to this film, the concept of there being infinite universes lowers the stakes of the plot, and possibly even negatively impacts the significance of previous films in the MCU. Additionally, Elizabeth Olsen's performance was shaky, the tone appeared to be unintentionally silly, and America Chavez was more of a plot tool to give them access to the multiverse rather than a genuine character. Trying to be bigger and more complex is not always the best route to a great film, especially in this case."
"Weak story, jumbled edit, just not good","Actors followed direction I expect but the film was just long and tedious. It needs a good editing, a good story and good direction. Won't be a repeat viewer."
Disappointing,
some weird directing choices but it's still very good.,
"Adding the kids, focusing the story around Wanda and restraining Raimi's madness ruined the movie","I really had high hopes for this sequel, as the first one was (in my opinion) original, engaging and with the right sense of humar.

This one was completely the opposite - boring, predictable, annoying and childish.

Important to mention: Who had the ""fantastic"" idea to cast all the kids? I rarely see kids with absolutely no acting experience and/or talent in such blockbusters. Their acting was horiffying.

Regarding the story... as many other reviewers wrote... this was more ""Wanda in the Multiverse of Madness"" and certenly not something the majority of viewers hoped to watch.

I could only prize the special effects (excepts some masks) - these were really top notch. It's a pity good movies don't consist just of that. ;-)"
Good but could've been better,
Doctor Strange and the WandaVerse,"Everyone has secrets from their past appears to be thematic in this movie.

However if you have access to all the multiverse you could maybe choose the right or wrong one for yourself and replace your alter-ego....and live happily ever after..simples... or not...This is what the film is about.

Well produced, cinematic, Sam Raimi directing so you're safe..settle into it and sit back and enjoy."
And now we're 30 films deep into this series...,"Weirdest Marvel movie ever. And so Rami campy. Downright Strange, even...very comic book, doubling down on horror elements, it's a pretty violent affair.

I loved it, but I'm THE target audience. It might not break into my top 10 MCU rankings, but it felt like reading a very excellent Doctor Strange issue, and that was just right."
Yes! Yes! Yes!,Man I miss Sam Raimi. This is the Dr. Strange Movie I want to see! So many cool parts. Everything was way cooler than all those crazy rooms from the first movie. This made more sense to me. Thank you!
perfect title multiverse of madness,"Amazing movie. But in all essence a horror love story. ""I love you in every universe"".the movie was too short neede to be at least 15 min longer but im goood sam raimi is the goat. Benedict ,lizzie wong, rachel and gomez were awesome. Watch in theaters only."
Evil Dead in the MCU,"Bruce Campbell was the best part of this movie. I couldn't figure out if I was watching Army of Darkness or a MCU film. Way too much focus on the occult for MCU. If I was expecting something from that genre, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. For a MCU film, it was a total mess and cut horribly. It felt more like a Scarlet Witch film, than Dr. Strange."
Sam raimi did it again!,
I really liked this DARK movie.,"I don't know why people are giving negative reviews but I liked the movie.

The movie is really dark and I liked it, because it adds a new flavour to the MCU.

And also the villain of the movie is way more stronger than Dr. Strange which makes it more interesting."
got me scare because of wanda,
UFC 274: Rose VS Esparza was MORE Entertaining,
Marvel movies are horrible,"They must think we are all completely brain dead. They continue to make these horrible movies because they think we have no standards. It's time we boycott these marvel movies, they don't deserve our time."
MID AF,
Way better than Spiderman No way Home,"Spiderman No way home was nothing but a fan service . Most of the MCU fans want cameos ,but this time in Doctor Strange MoM they got nothing (read expected cameos). People need to understand that only cameos can't make a good movie .

Positive: Performance of Elizabeth ,Benedict and others , screenplay,bgm ,vfx CGI , Direction Negative : Editing . The length was too short to hold the plot . Some fight scenes were unconvincing . Character development and origin story of America Chavez is not present .

Overall a great theatrical experience."
A spectacular film with horror overtones as Raimi knows how to do.,
Not as good as expected and teased,
As expected,"Generic, predictable, unoriginal... The only decent thing about this movie was CGI. Why not take the change on making something original, beautiful and special? The bar continue to be low, I will take another long break from Marvel and their movies until hopefully they will improve in the future.. Hope they will start creating great movies in the future. Feel sorry for the generation growing up watching these generic pieces of factory produce."
my opinion,
Madness is what it is,"OMG !!! Elizabeth Olsen nailed it being the Scarlet Witch and as an anti hero while Benedict Cumberbatch has outdone himself yet again being the Master of Mystical Arts playing Doctor Stephen Strange ... What caught my attention is that this is nowhere close to being a superhero movie but a horror movie though !!! Also Chiwetel Ejiofor and Benedict Wong have added their essence to the movie as well ... I have very little words to say or talk about this movie, what I mean is that creating a movie with action and CGI is one thing, but is not the same when one creates one with alternate universes colliding and brining it to reality is some thing different in its entirety ... With the collaboration of Sam Raimi's direction and Kevin Fiege's massive production this Marvel flick has made it ""POSSIBLE"" and ""ABSOLUTELY STRANGE"" indeed ..."
Difficult sequel,
I just didn't like it,"I can say it is not a bad movie, but deep down in my heart, I believe Sam Raimi wasted a good potential. I don't know if it is due to bad fighting scenes or bad story development. The movie is not fresh for me and somehow is very far from MCU masterpieces. I don't want to go deep into the movie, I just didn't like it."
Utterly disappointing,"I loved the first Dr Strange movie and was looking forward to this, but unfortunately it is a complete mess. The first movie had a coherent story with smart dialog and tastefully implemented special effects. This one is a train wreck of confusion drowning in CGI, populated by characters I couldn't make myself care about. Even the brilliant Benedict Cumberbatch could not make Dr Strange believable. There is something terribly wrong here, but it's not in the mysterious multi-verse. It's in the movie making biz that can't tell the difference between a good and bad movie anymore."
Underwhelming,
Woke AF,"One of the most boring MCU movies.

Bad writing , bad story, Left political agenda.

It has everything a leftist might like

It might be for you if you like Woke stuff."
"Complacent, predictable, forgettable","I've been wondering when MCU will collapse under the weight of its own hubris and complacency. They've given (well, sold) us quite a lot of fun - it's been a thrill ride, honestly, but personally I can't just take it anymore. A visual feast, void of any content.

The special feature of this installment was an attempt to make the movie scarier and more psychological (or just psychedelic?) - and I did like this eerie vibe. Having said that, I wish Sam Raimi had been given a chance to turn it into a proper horror movie - could've been great. Hopefully, next time the producers will spend less on CGI and get a proper script first.

PS Thank you, Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, for making it watchable. No other highlights."
It might be time to get off this ride,
Groovy!,"I loved it! Yes there was things I wished they'd done and no it wasn't perfect, but no movie is. I'm a huge fan of Sam Raimi and he did not disappoint! I was shocked how Dark/Creepy this film was! They really let Sam push boundaries on this! Visually stunning, good story, good cameos. (Wish there was more) Can't wait to own it. Probably best not to take the little ones too."
"Entertaining to watch and great special effects, but thats about it","Maybe this was hyped up to much but the story made little to no sense and didnt have a lot of depth, which is a shame since it easily could have had more depth concidering its the multiverse we're talking about with limitless pottensial. The villain in this story also makes illogical choices only driven by emotions which also kinda ruins the movie in a whole."
Disappointing...so disappointing.,"Love Marvel productions. The first Doctor Strange is amazing. Have watched it many times. It is thoroughly obvious that the second is not an actual Marvel production, but rather given over to another entity to have their way with. I see every Marvel movie in theatre, because they are usually best on the big screen. Almost walked out of this one. Big waste of time. I would consider this to be a B-rated production. If you're 10 you might enjoy it, but the plot was very lacking, and younger than 10 it might have had a bit too much out of place gore. All in all, it was a big fail."
Smart move!!!,"Although the content is not new, it must be said that the script is quite smart. The film seemed to be unable to handle all the character lines, but it turned out to be able to handle them all in a subtle way. Many shocks and plot twists in the movie. Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness will surprise you to the point of shock."
That music fight 😂,"I'm glad I had my marvel entertainment with first phase when I was young because now days all the new movies are just cash grab, meaningless stories and horrible cast."
Quit the woke garbage,"While I enjoyed the movie, I can do without woke crap infesting everything.

This film is quite a change for Marvel. Much darker and far less funny bits. It worked. Not too sure that some of the characters appearing were needed though."
Horror-esque Marvel Film,
"Pure madness, not much multiverse but its okay",
It wasn't what I expected but that's not bad,"So this film was amazing and I would say before you watch it get rid of all of your expections because then u might be hold back, but beside that it was really sick and ""different"" its really hard to put it in words, it's a good film to watch and enjoy and it definitely is a start to something big."
"""Ditsy Mom"" instead of D.S.I.T.M.O.M. is more accurate.","I'll start out with the good, which is the film has wonderful actors, the special effects are truly fantastic & well that is about all the good their is.

So I give 1 star for the actors ( yes they were very well paid & fortunately they have mostly proved their full potential in other acting rolls, so all the actors should be able to move on from this truly dreadful experience ).

The 2nd star is for the fantastic special effects ( as the special effects in the film were truly amazing as the people involved in that deserve credit ).

The actual film is unbelievably badly directed & the script was terrible.

That is why I can't give any more stars as this was such a terrible film.

Sam Raimi is not a good director & should never have directed this film.

Sam Raimi became famous for making the low budget film ""The Evil Dead"" (1981) which is good for him as some people liked it as a cheaply made film that was different at the time, but ultimately a good director it doesn't make him ( as he just did something different & it had a cult following ).

Everything else he has directed which people have seen has not been that great as the best he did was with Spider-Man 1, 2 & 3 ( 2002 to 2007 ) or the Tobey Maguire one's if you like ( which were OK films but no.3 in that series really showed how Sam Raimi really was not up to the job as he was not able to fix the script problems no.3 had, so how the hell did he get given a reported $200m to make Marvel movie ( as he just doesn't get it ).

The director's job is to make sure the script, the acting & how the movie flows all works in harmony & keeps the audience in a suspension of disbelief that they can enjoy ( as the audience should think yes these unlikely scenarios could logically lead from one to another & then with that the director has done his/her job & the audience can really enjoy the movie ).

Sam Raimi does not have this ability as he is simply a bad director.

( I have nothing against him as a person, but he is not up the job! )

Because Sam Raimi has no idea how make a film script flow obviously as the scenes in this film make no sense going from one to another & the audience ask themselves why is this so bad, ultimately this now kills the Marvel series as the first Dr Strange movie was good but this 2nd one is ever so awful.

Now with a bad director in charge the terrible script got through ( a decent director would have made the script be fixed first or refuse this movie ), so now we also have to look at the writer Michael Waldron as the script made no logical sense & people's motivations in the film were so unbelievable that it was impossible for an audience to be able to accept what was happening, as why was this writer given this $200m Marvel film?

Michael Waldron was a writer for ""Rick and Morty"" ( from 2019 which is 6 years after it first was aired ) so basically he wrote for a cult TV show 6 years after other writers had built an audience & this somehow qualifies him as a writer for one of the most important films being released in 2022?

( who is responsible for letting this bad writer ruin a Marvel franchise? ) Again I have nothing personal against the writer, it is just he is not good.

So you have an incompetent director ( who made one low budget film that was OK in 1981 & a writer who really has not proved anything ) & the film is an absolute disaster as the story is ridiculous because each of the main characters motivations make no sense & the story ( the heart of all films ) becomes totally broken 💔 & you are left not wanting to see any more.

The Eternals (2021) I gave 5 out of 10 was the start of the end of Marvel films ( being a must see as I won't buy that rubbish ) but this D. S. I. T. M. O. M. Or ""Ditsy Mom"" which is probably a more accurate title is the very END.

I'm definitely checking out who the director & writers are before I watch another Marvel film & if they have the reputations of a Sam Raimi & a Michael Waldron then there is no way I'm risking paying to go see it.

If ""Ditsy Mom"" was a DC comics film it would still be rated the worst one which is really saying something as there have been a few bad DC ones.

My Marvel collection will not be including this truly dreadful movie in it, as I can't see how Marvel can recover long term from this as it has killed it!

( I'm going to think of Guardians of the Galaxy 3 as a separate thing as James Gunn is an awesome director who understands what needs to be in a film - a true film maker who understands how films should work + flow ) Now if a director like James Gunn is in charge then you know you should get quality, as that is why these big budget films need proven directorial talent as if you can't just give it to someone who made an OK cheap movie back in 1981 & then expect it will be a success especially after seeing Spider-Man 3 as that was the film that proved he had no clue but the due diligence on this appointment was obviously not done & in turn we got an awful writer.

I've included no actual spoilers of the film as the director & writer have spoiled the whole film anyway & most likely have killed the franchise themselves too ( as now people will have lost faith in Marvel films ), as the title Ditsy Mom I gave this film will be quickly self explanatory if you choose to see how bad it is ( as not the actors fault as they did exactly what the director & script told them to do, as I do feel sorry for them in all of this )."
Meh.,
"Exactly what I wanted, but trailers spoiled a lot.","This is not your typical Marvel film. It takes you on a cosmic journey of epic proportions, with deep seeded emotions. Raimi pushes the PG13 rating to its limit, I'm surprised they left so much in. You can easily make an R cut. The story was engaging and there were some truly frightening moments. The villian is ferocious, powerful and just keeps coming.

Nit picking at the film, I felt the dialogue was clumsy at times, some jokes fell flat and some scenes went for a bit longer than they should have. Certain plot devices occurred way too conveniently, they just happened without a lead in to them, but the visual feast that's presented, and how the story unfolds, makes up for it. It does the original justice and continues the groundwork done by Scott Derrickson very well, while being something of itself.

The ending and post credits scene sets up a very interesting way forward and leaves some questions."
Great Film but blatant money grab from Disney+,
Dr.Strange The Wanda Madness,
Doctor Evil Dead in the Plot Hole Madness,
Poor movie,
Not sure what the plan was for this movie,"For someone that watched all the MCU movies but only made it through a few episodes of Wanda vision I was lost. Dr strange and Wanda both are so OP and could end a fight in 1 second yet they have all this dumb extra fighting and then dialogue that just makes you cringe and say ""what was the point of that random conversation "" even the sets looked a bit too much like a movie set. Bad acting, randomness, and in cohesiveness gives this movie a 2 star. Free on disney at the moment so don't have feel guilty spending money at the theater for this."
Good,
Makes no sense!,It's all over the place. Looks like just someone shuffling through their graphics and effects files and just meshing them all together. The America character didn't fit this storyline. It was so boring.
Raimi Creativity of Madness in Phase 4,
Cast,
The second best movie about the multiverse to ever come out in the past month,"I left the theater in a state of annoyance.

I had high hopes due to it being a Raimi film, and the Raimi is definetly there, but the rest just isn't.

Aside from its visuals and cinematography, this movie sucks. It's too fast paced, the characters are used badly and the story itself is straight up disappointing and questionable (marvel has made some really weird decisions on this one).

Instead of spending your money in a movie made by a lazy multi-million dollar company, watch ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" instead.

You won't regret it. ;)"
I wish I didn't expect much....This should be mini series...,"I like MCU, the storylines,backgrounds and connections between characters, half of the movie seems fulfill my expectations, but not the rest, I wish i can enjoy like people who rates more than 8 stars,but come on, its like mini series which is compressed into 1 episode. I don't know what lies in the future for this project, if you are an MCU fans, you will know why it is dissapointing from the middle to the end and have that kind of ending...."
First Marvel Review,"Most of the reviews i see dictate the movie a 6/10 saying there wasn't enough doctor strange or the movie was chaotic. This is my first review for marvel as I've only really liked 3 of their movies, but i feel this movie is really good and deserves a higher rating. I honestly think its receiving a low rating because it diverted from marvels generic direction. There was gore every marvel movie misses. Not much else to say, its one of their top tier movies, I mean madness is in the name and people believe the story too crazy?

Save for the ending, that was pretty generic for marvel."
Marvel - Rami Style,
A really good thrill ride very more mature,
Bad,
The (Marvel) Cinematic Universe of Madness,
"Fallen into Madness, Love it!","I am sure some of us witness the tv series of WandaVision, and we do sympathize with Wanda as she lost her two sons. In her declaration of her madness she is after America Chavez, and Doctor Strange must cross the multiverse in order to save her and Wanda before the multiverse has an incursion.

Sam Raimi brings his horror element of Wanda to life. We see the carnage and death of super hero that faces Wanda. This was truly the darkest MCU movie I have ever witness and I am glad to see it.

I don't get the hate of this movie though, maybe because the Illuminati and Mordo having less screen time. But I do enjoy Benedict Cumberbatch, Xochiti Gomez, Elizabeth Olsen, and Benedict Wong's acting and performance."
Dumb,"This made me so angry I don't know what they were aiming for but this ruined all the excitement for the multiverse in my opinion.

Such poor writing. So many plot holes, such weird effects."
Madness indeed,"First of all, the music and visuals were amazing. Top notch as always. Now onto the movie itself. I was in shock and awe of what I've just witnessed. The characters, set pieces, costumes, horror, just everything about it I can't fault it.

Won't give any spoilers at all, just go and watch it!"
Rick and Morty-esque on Marvel Steroids,"Overall great movie! Nuff' said. Good plot,. Had some horror. Gave me a bit of Inception vibes. Acting was good, and the scenes were chaotically captivating."
All that for nothing,
Wtf is this,"I thought it's a good movie, because everyone said it was a masterpiece. So I watched it and I was totally disappointed. Like the cgi was OK. And I kinda liked the darkness of this movie bit the blood looked so unreal that it made this dark scenes kinda funny. It really seems like a Disney+ production, not like a good movie or blockbuster. And it's def not oscar worthy. Disney+ productions are cheap and bad. That' what I felt in the first 10 minutes. The acting was not good, at all. And why does Marvel always let superheroes make their posture. Like this is so cringe. And this is also a reason why the movie was bad. The camera movement was bad and made me feel sick because of the rotations. No good cinematography. I prefer Netflix. 1,5/10 Stars."
puts a new spin on things,"From hubristic neurosurgeon, to Kamar-Taj underling, to Master of the Mystic Arts, to time-traveling Sorcerer Supreme, to Avenger and protector of reality, Dr. Strange professes happiness, but following a set-to with Wanda Maximoff he discovers unrest in the multiverse, and embarks on a quest for the antithesis of the Darkhold--easier said than done. Sam Raimi and his Evil Dead sensibilities make him the ideal director as this delves into the horror genre with plenty of shock and awe and a real visual flair. Doesn't find its stride for a while, but there's plenty to please the eye and the expected teases, plus a good cast with MCU newbie Xochitl Gomez fitting right in, and Olsen who has a flavorful role as the Scarlet Witch. **½"
Dumb & pointless,"This film was a CGI monstrosity that bored that hell out of me. It starts bad, it ended bad, it was laughable at times. Not worth the grueling long time to watch it. The only part I enjoyed was the epic battle in the middle with Captain (spoiler) and Xavier."
All the cameos just came to die. Disappointing.,
Has that Sam Raimi charm.,
Close your eyes and it's Sam Rami's Spiderman,"As I watched I was convinced the score was by Danny Elfman, he has this signature theme that was pure Spiderman. Turns out he is the composer on this film. Another review referred to this film as ""Scooby Boo"" and I tend to agree, CGI overload. I much preferred the first Dr Strange, had some grit to it. Passable but I'll watch a drama next time around."
Doctor Strange review...,"Spoilers warning... Doctor Strange Multiverse of madness is madness Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange and Elizabeth Olsen was perfect in there role, director Sam raimi make a action horror film as he knowns for. First half was awesome but second half was little but weak as compared to first one this film looks like describing wanda more than Strange. Weak Storyline byt sam raimi direction saves it... Overall a good watch.

8/10."
A long term ploy by Disney that will never work.,
I liked it well enough,
Multiverse of Madness breaks away from the typical Marvel formula and creates an identity of its own. Thanks to Sam Raimi for his creative influence.,"Dr Stephen Strange casts a forbidden spell that opens a portal to the multiverse. However, a threat emerges that may be too big for his team to handle.

Review: After all the teases and the potential plot discussions, the Multiverse of Madness has finally arrived and the bigger question remains if it's up to the mark. Well, it's a yes and a no. A no if you've been following too many of the theories which could've led to a mammoth of expectations from the movie and a yes because of a variety of reasons. A direct continuation of WandaVision and Far From Home, the Multiverse of Madness just scratches the surface of the Multiverse with this outing, which is great because since the Fourth Phase of MCU is inherently believed to be based on the Multiverse, you're comfortable in knowing there's so much more yet to come. In all honesty, beyond the Multiverse, it's the story of Doctor Strange and Wanda Maximoff with predominantly being Wanda's. Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda takes out all her guns in this outing, unleashing herself as the most dangerous villain you've seen as yet, even exceeding Thanos, in my opinion at least. This was also evident in Endgame when Thanos had to resort to 'Rainfire' when he encountered her. That Wanda has now grown 10x or more powerful. She was the show stealer in Multiverse of Madness similar to how Thanos and Thor were for Infinity War. Doctor Strange plays the perfect antagonist in her mind. American Chavez is also integral to the plot for obvious reasons e.g her multiversal travel abilities. How the three are interlinked goes back to the ending of WandaVision, a show which is significant and a prerequisite for every viewer who's going to watch this movie. With Sam Raimi on board known for his Evil Dead series, there are plenty of horror moments with jump scares included, which is unarguably a welcome addition to the MCU. MCU has been experimenting as of late with different styles of storytelling, thereby remaining relevant in the process. And it's the right choice because one can only do so much in the superhero genre. With a sitcom like presentation for WandaVision, Dynamic presentation of Moon Knight focusing on mental conflict and now elements of horror in this movie, it's an experiment which seems to be working. But yes, the movie does seem chopped because of quick change of scenes, but I guess it was done to put more focus on the pace of the movie and to avoid distraction from the central characters. My suggestion is to go into this without expecting a lot of theories you've read because in it's truest form it's an excellent film and a great harbinger for all the 'true' multiverse madness which is to follow."
Great direction bogged down by a mess of a script,"Marvel movies have been disappointing since Infinity War, but as a fan of Sam Raimi's early work, from Evil Dead to Darkman, A Simple Plan and of course his Spiderman trilogy, I dared to have high hopes for this film.

And indeed, the direction stands out as possibly the best of any Marvel movie to date. It's night and day compared to boring, flatly shot by the numbers filmmaking like the new Spiderman trilogy. Raimi is able to perfectly balance levity, action, character moments and even suspense and a bit of his trademark horror.

However, even Kubrick level direction couldn't have fixed this absolute mess of a script.

The plot has characters behaving completely out of character, forces character to act stupidly for the next plot point to happen and worst of all, is almost completely reliant on prior knowledge of the Wandavision TV show. Not having seen that, Scarlet Witch's motivation is entirely illogical, not to mention her turn from hero to genocidal maniac is completely out of character who someone who helped save the universe from Thanos.

The MCU has turned into a giant, unfocused mess, where nostalgia, cross-promotion, marketing or woke identity politics nonsense take precedence over narrative coherence. While unlike the most recent plot driven Marvel movies Dr. Strange 2 is actually mostly charcter driven, it suffers from the same flaw as all recent Marvel films: character driven dialogue scenes are almost always cut short by someone yelling ""enough talking"", before the movie grinds to a halt for a nauseating 15 minute scene of cartoon physics and adobe after effects plugin energy beams.

The central conflict of this film may have been the worst case yet. The entire reason for the confrontation with thousands killed could have been avoided with one simple sentence ""No Wanda, you kill the girl to take her power, but we will find a universe in which you children are orphaned, and take you there."" Or maybe even add a twist that in one of these universes Wanda is evil and must be stopped. Or start the movie with Wanda heading to a universe in which she foresees the Wanda of that universe will be killed, and initially try to rescue her, only for Wanda herself to be revealed as the killer from the vision.

There could have been hundreds of ways to give her a better motivation that was not relaint on friends being unable to talk sense into each other.

That really is the core problem with these Marvel movies. Supposedly intelligent characters are unable to communicate simple ideas to each other and end up fighting. The same happens with Strange and the Illuminati.

The writers sacrifice character and narrative for spectacle, and it's a darm shame, because comic book movies have shown that they can be intelligent, character driven stories that still entertain. But even the spectacle is underwehlming. Maybe I've been spoiled by the recent Batman or Dune movies, but the Marvel movies feel increadibly cheap. From digital chromatic abberation to directional blur and various energy blast and particle flow plugins, effects in MCU films often look like envato presets. Even the matting looks bad, like on the rooftop scene after the opening. The actors were clearly on a soundstage that was badly matted onto a digital backdrop of NY. If a production can't even be bothered to arrange for a drone shot of the actors on a roof in NY, you know there's something wrong.

The acting is generally underwhelming here, except for Elizabeth Olsen steals every scene she is in. Imagine what she could do with a good script.

Aside from her, the other standout performance is by... Bruce Campbell. Because of course it is. It's one of several little Evil Dead easter eggs. I really wish someone would give this guy some leading roles, because he just lights up the screen."
Madness of Wanda in the Multiverse,I think Scarlet Witch has more screentime than doctor strange in this movie. Dr. Strange is like a side character in his own movie. Doesn't have any proper Dr.strange fight scene which we have seen in the 1st part as well as in the Infinity war. Doesn't have that much multiverse and multiverse characters what I've expected. Overall it's a good movie but not up to my expectations. It could've been much better.
What's Disney's motivation??,"Obviously Disney is now also destroying the MCU after successfully burying Star Wars.

Really sad, as there was so much potential in both of that worlds... Will quit Disney+ immediately as they don't deserve any further support for that BS.

2nd star only for some visual effect."
Too many comic book nerds ruining the rating of this film!,"Enough with the insanely long essays on how this movie didn't live up to your expectations and move out of your parents house.

Great movie experience and I would recommend it to anyone!"
Need back history from the tv miniseries,
One of the few marvel films that I actually like,"Don't get me wrong, it isn't really anything besides a nice movie but I did end up liking it

Raimi tries to deviate from the bland Marvel formula and succeeds at times but he could have done a lot more at times

Surprised and disappointed at the same time I guess."
Dr Strange can't stand alone,
"Great visual effects, lousy script","This is today's commercial movie entertainment. Great visual effects filling big plot holes: great visual effects, lousy script. Widely wasted concepts such as multiverse tampered with exhaustion and reduced to a simple excuse for the screen to vomit thousands of shots of CGI.

Great cameos and fan service for great disappointments and vague future justifications, within another upcoming movie.

The performances are decent, but even if the actors want to try harder, the roles don't demand too much of them. The presence and vision of Sam Raimi are appreciated for the film to get a little out of its formula. If it is to entertain, the film serves its purpose. Everything else is standard, decent, compliant, average, even conservative.

Entertaining, but disappointing, if that mix of concepts is allowed."
Would have been 9 stars,"Absolutely love what Sam Raimi did with this movie. He is a genius, and he took the repetitive template that all Marvel movies have become and put a wonderful fresh spin on it. Would have given it 9 stars if it wasn't for the woke agenda that Disney slipped into the film. Disney needs to go back to being a family entertainment company."
Superb Direction,"The movie is so well directed that you can feel Sam Raimi's touch in every aspect. Great acting. The writing of the movie has touched the pinnacle of imagination but the plot isn't upto the expectations.

The character Wanda is felt a mismatch than the series Wanda-Vision. And the illuminati could have a proper introduction. It new MCU characters doesn't feel connected to their previous movies/series.

But all these shortcomings is properly managed at the direction level. You can experience a real horror element as Kevin Feige promised.

Overall a great experience for me."
It's amazing don't believe the negetive reviews,"It's a doctor strange movie and why tf everyone is expecting something like nwh ....it has amazing visuals, insane fight sequences and epic music just go and watch it in the biggest screen possible it's one of the best Marvel movies yet."
Oh dear...,"Sucks. Bad story, average acting, bad cgi (way too much of it), bad soundtrack (way too much of it). A hot mess - an onslaught of one confusing scene after another which I wouldn't want to watch again if it was free. If this is the direction Marvel is heading it's a big no from me. Just remember the good 'ole days..."
Quantity over quality,"If I'm honest with myself, the only things I liked about this movie were the visuals and the direction of Sam Raimi, but that's it. The story is propelled only by its visuals, the actual narrative itself has barely any meat to it. This movie would've been better if they dialed back the fan-service in favor of actual motivations, meaningful dialogue that's not just exposition, fleshing out characters etc.

This movie is made for the sake of fan-service and overwhelming visual wow-factor, interlaced with hints of a better movie existing in some alternate reality.

I don't recommend watching it."
Hey Marvel What's With All The Jump Scares?,"Is this the Blair Witch project or is this Doctor Strange?

I swear this movie has more jump scares than any other horror movie.

What are you trying to do Marvel? Didn't know you were in the horror movie genre.

Also is this Wanda Vision 2? We have already seen that series and it sucks. Stop pushing the the scarlet witch on us."
The CGI is horrible and the story is soo boring,
Good Stuff,Very good installment of this installment of Marvel films. Benedict Cumberbatch is DR Strange. He embodies the character so well. Can't say much without spoilers but a lot of surprises from early on. Not too long and no prior knowledge of the series needed. Great special effects.
What utter rubbish,"I have enjoyed some of the Marvel movies, but this one was absolute balderdash. Utter drivel, not even a coherent narrative. Pointless. I lost interest almost from the beginning, but sat through it. Incredibly bad. If you have the chance to see it, really, don't bother."
Evil dead goes MCU. Wandavision 2?,
Ridiculously stupid.,I'm not sure how the Marvel team gave the go-ahead for this plot. This movie pales in comparison to any of the phase three movies. The only reason for even two stars is because Cumberbatch is a grade A actor. Do better.
Would give 0 stars if I could,Don't waste your time the whole films utter trash and I've sat through human centipede 3. I would give 0 stars if I could. Honestly one of the worst films I've seen in last few years. Weak plot. Weak story. Weak acting. Weak visuals.
Did not live up to the hype :(,
Brilliant - MORE WANDA,
Disappointed,
Too divergent for me...,"This film just seemed too much of a divergent from the previous storylines that it left me feeling let down. The whole multiverse aspect is a nice plot but it was not well executed in my opinion in terms of story development. A likable character was made into the ultimate villain and the main character came off as a sentimental sap. Not my cup of Marvel tea. Once the End Game ended, so did my desire to see subsequent Marvel movies."
"If this was not a Marvel movie, It probably wouldn't have been made.","I had to endure this movie because my brother was too hyped to see it. The movie was a total mess, nothing made sense and the acting was just up to marvel standards and crammed to the gills with CGI. This is a spectacle? Sure, is it a good movie? Hell!!! No, according to me. I don't think this movie should have been made."
A must-watch movie of 2022,"Doctor strange was my favourite marvel character..💜 Thumbs up to the outstanding production 👍 Just my point of view, this is a must-watch movie of 2022...Good job to all the cast and development team 👏👏👏"
"""You break the rules and become a hero""","This was absolutely bonkers. It's not the opening of the multiverse that I thought the events of Spider-Man/ Wandavision/ Loki would have me believe. In fact, you could very much not even watch those other ones and this movie would still make perfect sense. The worst part of it all was the absolute witch-hunt they performed on Wanda's character arc."
"If you can imagine a horror movie from Disney, this would be it","I expected something different, but I was not disappointed. The whole concept is a bit new and I was surprised, that they can always give the audience something fresh.

Like the storytelling with double exposure - classic for cinema, but not really in MCU. Little differences like that.

Or the scary and shocking scenes combined with wild, but Disney style (the music, colors, ideas, a nice zombie).

I believe it´s hard to imagine it and I don´t want to give away any spoilers, but despite some flaws, I truly enjoyed the movie:)"
Multiverse of boringness,
A joke,
A perfect waste of a potential good story,"A perfect waste of a potential good story.

They completely missed the mark and ruined beloved characters in a short disrespectful way. Marvel lost their touch."
Marvel need to take a break .,"Save yourself time and money and just skip this most boring movie ever! I mean at this point aquaman was 100 times better! Just as a reference to how bad!

Really disappointed!"
Solid time in the theatre all things considered,
Story wasn't up to my expectations,"Although Benedict's acting saved the movie, the story-line of the whole movie was silly.

A certain someone goes berserk and starts a war - it's like that Avengers Civil war movie all over again but with story-line which makes much less sense as you continue watching the movie till the end.

I really hope MCU writers come up with better sequels else they'll end up wrecking the existing Avengers characters.

Thoroughly disappointed."
Too much of madness! Yes,Its like going here and there multi verse. Not a bad movie at all i like that using signs to attack. But has very harsh ending like no hype. And its like very artificial both animations and other backgrounds so it makes lil but boring atmosphere. But jus a watchable movie. If this could be watched in 3D ithe idea might be different coz it has alot of 3D movie elements and would be enjoyable.
Doesn't feel like a marvel film,
"Very good, but not as mad as it seems.","This movie is very good, I personally liked it more than NWH and maybe The Batman, but it isn't as mad as the trailers, promos, poster and title makes it seems. Other than that it's a 10/10. There were only like 2 boring parts, some horror, a lot of action and some comedy. I would also recommend watching previous movies and shows such as WandaVision, Loki, Avengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Spider-Man: Far from Home, X-Men and more to better understand the movie."
THIS MOVIE WAS SO FU*KING AMAAAZZZZZIINNNNGGGGG!!!!!,I love Sam Raimi's direction and what a performance by Elizabeth Olsen & Benedict Cumberbatch. 11/10 for the movie. Let Sam direct more marvellous movies like this!
Multiverse of Midness,"The hype after No Way Home was real... the fact that Doctor Strange has been one of the most powerful and prominent characters in the MCU since 2016 also made the hype go crazy. Sam Raimi coming in to direct, Elizabeth Olsen being casted, Patrick Stewart, and more were all reasons why this movie had the potential to be great. I was skeptical for this just like I was for No Way Home. The only problem is that No Way Home stuck the landing and this one... just didnt. I got in my car after the movie was over and just sat there for about 15 minutes trying to get my thoughts together. I'm conflicted. I love Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange. They're some of my favorite characters in the MCU... but in this one they just felt like some part of their arcs were missing. Wandavision was great up until the final episode for me and this is a continuation of WV but it doesn't have the same charm or charisma. I've wanted Wanda to go evil but it just felt weird and they could've done it way better. The movie is rushed, they don't let Sam Raimi go full Raimi, the cameos feel a bit cheapened, and the whole movie just feels... off. Now I didn't hate it or anything and I did enjoy most of it for what it was... but it could've been so much more. There's so many character choices that just piss me off.. I have so many complaints and questions and I don't know, man... it just feels rushed, incomplete, and like they switched directors and the chronological order of movies (which they did). All in all, on first watch Doctor Strange 2 gets a 7/10 from me. The first one was way better and this one is probably dead in the middle of the MCU for me. Subject to change and I feel like it could go lower... Closing Thoughts: Multiverse of Midness Lmao The Multiverse wasn't that mad, okay? It was like 4 Universes. Inaccurate title."
What s disappointment,
"Awful, just awful","Sorry, but this is just pure crap. The story was weak, acting awful and if I could have rated it 0/10, honestly, I really would have done. We watched it on Disney+ and I almost felt like asking for money back for the time I spent watching it. Avoid it like cock rot."
Sam Raimi!!!! TOOOP,
Scarlet Witch in the multiverse of madness,This is not a usual marvel movie. Its quite on a darker side some may like it others may not. Sam Raimi put his best on bringing that dark face to the movie. Pls don't believe that every rumours come true . Marvel spoiled a lot in the trailers which would have been better if we have seen that unexpected. The visuals are the key a top notch experience. People calling marvel on a softer side will definitely change their mind after watching the movie. As a person who loves horror film this film is a big asset. Don't miss the madness on believing the reviews and stuff see for yourself and find out. #VisualTreat.
"Sensory Overload, Flat Characters","The battle scenes and film in general were too flashy. Dr Strange had no character development and lacked depth. The focus was too much on introducing as many star cameos as possible. Instead they should've focused more on their lead. To me it's evident that Marvel is starting to struggle with juggling all of their All-Stars. Not every Avenger can get a trilogy, but at least give them a proper arc.

As the biggest positive, I liked that this movie had a more serious note compared to a lot of other Marvel movies. The jokes were good placed and not over the top."
"Great Direction, Rough Characterization",
What are in the multiverse of madness did I just watch?,"First let me say I know I am late to the game to watch let alone review this however, I went in thinking okay I'll give it a try. Didn't hear reviews one way or another. About 15 or so minutes in I began to get board. Where was this story going? Why was everything so dark and scary? Scarlet was way to flipping powerful, I mean where was this person when fighting the big purple guy? Let's talk about plot holes? This movie didn't add anything to the universe. It didn't really set up anything for the future. I was highly...HIGHLY disappointed in this one. So far my most ""lame"" avenger movie is any man and I'd go watch that 5 times in a row than watch this dumpster fire of a film. Disney had an agenda in this one as well. Don't think we didn't notice the pin she was wearing either. Might as well have had giant flags with this on it. Overall two thumbs WAY down for this one."
The latest Sam Raimi movie about magic and monsters and stuff,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was an entertaining popcorn movie. While this wasn't the worst movie i've seen this year, there were lots of issues with it. Lets nitpick.

First of all, if you are a fan of the actual Marvel Comics, there isn't much to marvel here. Same as all the other MCU flicks this is first and foremost an attempt to grab some cash from normies. But lets go into detail. Shuma Gorath at the beginning came out so well, its a shame he didn't get more screen time.

Some of the scenes throughout this movie were awfully flat and unimaginative. Casting is horrible in places.

Instead of casting Bruce Campbell as the easter egg, they should have given him the role of Reed Richards. The actual guy who plays Mr. Fantastic absolutely doesn't nail it. The actress who plays the Scarlet Witch isn't sinister enough. And like many other MCU actors she simply lacks the physicality for the role. The CGI throughout the film, especially the magic effects are stale, unimaginative and boring. We've seen these swirling glow effects a million times already in various movies and games. Some of the dialogue as in most MCU movies is just downright cringy.

On the bright side it was entertaining to see some of the Sam Raimi Evil Dead cinematography again! But i fee like it would have been nicer if this guy would have actually made a NEW Evil Dead movie instead!

So all in all Dr. Strange 2 is mildly entertaining. Not sure if i will be back for part 3. Probably."
"An exciting, yet dark turn for the MCU","Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness is a huge turn for the MCU. It's a mind-bending film that will have the fans on the edge of their seats. However, there's something else. This is by far the darkest and most disturbing movie in the MCU's history, filled with moderate gore and horrifying scenes. Aside from this, it's definitely worth the watch for the older fans, but maybe leave the younger fans out of this, just in case."
"Groans of ""WTF"" Echo Through the Multiverse.","Went to see this with a friend who loves superhero films, and... MMM BOI. TL;DR: this film is an incoherent bad mess with no understanding of logic nor consequences; honestly, the cameos in the film were the only exciting part from the audience's reaction. The CGI was good and what earned the second star for my rating. This film is probably just a symptom of Disney/Marvel realizing that people will go see these things regardless of the quality and they can rake in the cash. That overarching complaint applies to so many other just-churn-them-out superhero films, but the first Dr. Strange film was a nice break from that disappointment-train of movies... it was actually kind of enjoyable, with a storyline that didn't make me want to smash my head against something blunt and dense. I guess they could only delay the inevitable so long and had a huge debt to the corporate-garbage-gods, and boy oh boy did it show in this film. Is it just me, but do the power levels between heros in this film mean nothing to the writers? Like someone is OP but then, nope, not anymore for this fight... and the only exciting cameos from other superheros, who've been established in other films, come in and then-wow, maybe this will be a better fight where logic appl-NOPE, just forget everything you thought you knew before, this film does what it wants. Hearing everyone groan ""WTF"" in the theater time and again was a nice consolation that kept my brain from imploding. I'm resolving myself to not see any more Marvel films, and I hope you do to. If it's good, someone can tell me about it."
What happened ???,"I was REALY excited FOR the movie, and Wanda in particular, but it was a very messy movie and I was REALY disappointed. It wasn't worth the wait. I really liked WandaVision, but it seems that they forgot about the events of the series completely🤦‍♀️"
Not actually the mutliverse of madness. Not satisfied 😑😑,
I am disappointed,
Fun Ride,"Fun movie , well directed obviously.

Very lil woke politics , so you won't get pissed off.

Definitely more of a horror vibe than you'd expect , which is a breath of fresh air from marvel/Disney.

Easter eggs everywhere , whether they lead somewhere , we'll have to see .

Enjoy :)"
Fine good movie but underwhelming,I think original director Scott Derickson would of done a better job bringing this movie to screen especially with the horror elements as nothing came off as scary here. Directing and cut scenes are very corny and felt like comic book movies going back 20 years with the campiness. Because of the corniness and campiness the sad scenes with Wanda are hard to get really invested and actually connect with her like you did in WandaVision. It's a fine good movie just underwhelming with because of directing and sometimes dialogue.
I don't even know where to start ...,
unwatchable,Made it about 15 - 20 minutes. Absolute tripe. Don't understand how i could have anything in common as a human being with someone that thinks this movie has any value at all.
Eeeeeh okay,"Not bad, not good, could be worse but vould have been better. It has some major flaws, unfinished orevious stories still left unfinished, 6 points would feel too low 7 points feel too high bit since I cannot givve half points and I actually enjoyed the movie lets stay on 7 and here is for the hope to the next one will be better! Cheers!"
First comic book Horror,This movie was phenomenal top to bottom. I enjoyed this movie so much. Sam Raimi's signature element's were all over this movie. The pacing may have been too fast for me but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I'm so happy to see Dr Strange be the Dr Strange he was always meant to be as potrayed in the comics. Go and see this movie and have a time of your life.
Bad,"Had too much greenscreen and not a good storyline. The acting was terrible, and the political views being pushed unnecessary. Make it about the character not about your political views."
Ruined great Concept,This movie ruined the original legacy of Dr. Strange. Wanda everywhere and the ending just sucks.....................................................................
"Decent leads buried under a meandering, muddled script","Olsen is pheromonally compelling, and she's given fair support by the stolid Wong and spunky McAdams. Cumberbatch is watchable, but just collecting his pay check at this point. Ejiofor is tolerable, and despite some cringe level token diversity casting among the minor characters, the (White European) Gomez isn't awful, although her performance is completely bland and forgettable.

I focus on the actors because it's all downhill from there.

The writing is simply dreadful. There's no narrative arc, just two hours of chase and snuff told in a series of essentially unrelated ""and then, and then, and then"" scenes. Characterisation is minimal, and the dialogue is almost pure exposition with no memorable lines.

Visual effects are fair except for a bizarrely modelled octopus creature which is inexplicably Harryhausen in appearance. If they had a point to make with it, it wasn't explained. Costumes and makeup are decent, although the Raimi deadite motifs are mere pastiches.

The score is appalling, being a near constant barrage of overblown blaring which drowns out the dialog and any possibility of emotional investment. That's fine, because the denouement is an absolutely inevitable ""oh, my bad"".

Pacing is a real problem, managing to feel dragging, padded and rushed all at once. It's either half an hour to long, or half an hour too short.

The whole thing is a dreadful waste of the on-set talent, on both sides of the camera. It was doomed by the writing before it began, and the post production made it worse, not better.

Sadly, but not unexpectedly, this is everything we've come to expect from the Mouse wearing the hollowed out-shell of Marvel as a skin-suit."
"Bold, Dark, Unique and Magnificent","With NWH and MOM, Marvel has entered the Multiverse Saga. From now on, things will go out hand.

Those who are giving negative reviews expecting too many cameos, don't you want the multiverse to have a build up?? The Multiverse has just begun. There will be numerous cameos in future movies."
This is how you kick off summer,Okay so after seeing the previous movie and seeing the trailer for this movie I knew I absolutely had to say it didn't disappoint it's one of the absolute best movies of the year no doubt there was plenty of action and adventure laughs as well here I highly recommend it.
Mediocre and forgettable at best.,"This movie is a prime example of how MCU has been going downhill since Endgame/Wandavision.

The story is quite weak and underwhelming and lacks the emotional depth that we used to get in most of the MCU movies.

Too many unlikable and obnoxious characters on the good side including Dr. Strange whereas the purported villain, (spoiler) might be on the wrong side and succumbs to evil and destruction but has the strongest character arc and frankly is the only character I was rooting for despite the malicious nature of the villain.

Elizabeth Olsen, who reprises the role of Wanda/Scarlet Witch, delivers a meticulous and delicate performance and easily the best part of the movie if not the only part.

The 2nd Dr. Strange movie is also inferior to the first movie on the part of the special effects that the first one absolutely nailed.

Their pathetic attempts to appease the fans with mostly unwanted cameos are simply embarrassing at this point especially just 5 months after the release of No Way Home, which honored some of the major characters the fans have grown to love in a way the fan service serves the overall story.

All in all, this movie is shallow, uninspiring and infused with trite and hackneyed themes, messages and plots that we've seen too many times before.

This movie epitomizes the death of the creativity and originality of MCU."
"Killer wanda and fan service, who is dr. Strange?",
Loved it! Except for a couple minor things...,
Something is lacking,"Now what is lacking? Well the thing is they tried to make this movie as a reply of all the critics of being stereotypical marvel movies. I will give them 10/10 in the department of trying but when it comes to the presentation... it was lacking the ""MARVEL"" theme, now they made so hype within the viewers.. no one will actually criticize about this but few."
Justify the madness word in the title!!,So doctor strange in the multiverse of maddness justify the word madness in the title but why? Ok so let's start from the beigining the film is great the scenes best mcu film after spider-man nwh I can confirm to you bendict cumerbuch and Elizabeth Olsen where gives the apperments of there life! The film is feel like a Sam rainy movie and when Kevin figie said that the evil dead 2 fans will be happy he haven't lied. The film is a full horor film amricka Chavez and strange chimstry is great! All the things in this film are great! But there always a bad one sometimes the plot is hard to catch up but if you a big marvel fan and you know the besic you will be fine. Also stay for the post credit scene it a game changer and you got to see the first doctor strange film before seen this one you will understand why's. Finale score 99/100.
They should change the title!,
It got dark,"Honestly it had its shortcomings but also there are quite many redeeming qualities. So I really liked it, also I'm loving the tone they're setting for this phase. I loved the darker tone in this. I'd definitely be thinking about it for days to come.

Everyone was great in it. All except America ofcourse."
Rushed with multiple plot holes.,It looks like Marvel is relying heavily on fan hype and ignoring finer details. Something older movies focused on but has been lost since some time now. At best this movie deserves average.
Terrible plot,"Plot is terrible, really how was it even approved. Acting is not that great too. The characters are not believable. In the end, this movie is a waste of time."
Flat emotionless characters,"What happened here? Did Sam Raimi really direct the movie or the studio got in his way?

Marvel promised phase 4 will be more horror and I am still waiting."
"Cool effects, but messy","As with so many other candidate blockbuster movies the focus is constantly on effects without managing to promote a clear storyline. There is just so much going on combined with swish, swish, bang, bangs all the time. Focus, focus man!"
Madness indeed,"I've seen this film twice and I love it. The special effects were great, the performances were excellent and it was a little bit scary in parts. It's not a 100% a horror film but it has some horror elements to it.

Can't wait to see more of the good Doctor."
The WORST marvel movie of all time.,"Wtf was this? Boring, too much dark devil things, bad bad movie. Don't waste time by seeing this. So weird and complicated. Classic Ironman, thor, avengers movies much much better."
One of the worst movies this year,"I've seen a lot of movies but this is one of the worst ones this year. The plot was ok but realy weird and absurd. The acting in general was ok as well but especially the acting of Xochitl Gomez was without emotions and very monotonous.

This movie with its name wasn't what I hoped and thought it would be. Maybe it's time for Disney to explore new horizons of they want to stay relevant and gaining billions of dollars. It was a good film for wasting time on my couch but it's not for enough for buying a ticket at the cinema."
Boring,I guess if you want non stop repetition this is for you. I became uninterested within the first half hour. It was just background noise for the rest of the movie.
To many expectations,"Just a boring movie to watch, everything has unveiled in the trailer, whooaammmmm..

Marvel pushing to hard in term of multiverse, so many missing detail."
Mediocre mess,"This film is a mess with great CGI but lacking story. I dont hate the film but the writing was not great. Getting to the third stage was quite awful due to the 2nd stage being quite messy because of too many things going on. The 3rd stage itself wasnt great due to poor storytelling. The plot was all over the place. It said in the plot there would be mutiple versions of strange but there were only 2 so thats kinda falce marketing. American chad(America chavez) is useless and destracts from the main character Physician unknown(doctor strange) and is just a plot device. Queen elizabeth's(Wanda Maximoff) motivations to be the villain are also poorly written. She killed 100s of people just because she wanted to spend time with her 2 kids🤡. There were some cool shots which where obviously tampered by Sam raimi but its only a few. The horror elements were also cool but they didnt scare me that much. I wanted to like this film but i cant...

5/10-Mediocre(Again i dont hate this film but i just dont think its great)"
Not your typical mcu film,"Decent film altogether, most of the film is quite fast paced, yet not what you where probably expecting. The film has many horror aspects, as well as the most violent and gory scenes in the mcu. Not for little kids."
I think this ruined the franchises sustainability.,"It was already a rough watch, and then the music fight happened. At that point I could no longer justify my continued viewing of this movie. The story felt rushed and the villain wasn't as big of a shock that it should've been."
"Half MCU film, half big-budget horror mess","After the fantastic ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", and the fleshing out of Wanda in ""WandaVision"", I was really excited to see what was next in this expanding universe. Once I saw Bruce Campbell though, I was reminded that this is a Sam Raimi film with all the odd tropes: singing, zombies, cheap scares, closeups, heavy-handed Danny Elfman score, etc. It's a good reminder that even a $150M budget doesn't make someone a good director. There are parts that play like a Marvel movie with heart and humor, and build on an expanding universe like we've been promised. The rest is a mess, and does total disservice to when we last saw Wanda. If you like her character, or especially if you liked her series, you will not like this movie."
Do they have a mother?,
Scarlet Witch carries the movie!,
It's getting repetitive,"The best way to describe it is ""meh"". While surprisingly good in some places, especially when you can see the references to the old spider-man movies in directing style, in everything that is about story and character development it's just not intersting...at all...The main villains motivation is laughable at best."
I honestly didn't like it,"I honestly didn't like it, there is a character that his development was quite weak, there is no reason in his actions. However, to another character that is quite coherent, but his development in the film is left aside at many points and passes by. It is a journey as a backdrop. There is nothing too crazy, no exploration, no risk. It lacks a bit of depth and yet there is a lot of action in this movie. Act 3 is pretty anticlimactic."
What Da Heck Going On...,"What the hell is going on in this movie.

It begins in a stupid way, and introduces us to an incrediblky stupid story, and then ends in the a stupid way as well.

The First Doctor Strange Movie was not that good but still better compared to whatever THIS is.

This is atrocious!"
Inconsistent with No Way Home,
Wish I could like it but...,"It's focusing to much adding in characters from other marvel stuff. The story had potential but it really needed to be more stand alone, not hanging on you having seen every marvel film ever.

Wanda vision is far from the best work. They should have had Dr strange as the main villan. Wanda... Should not have made the cut.

Nice visuals tho."
Second time watching changed my rating,After my first time watching the movie I was frustrated and disoriented. I felt betrayed for the sake of Wanda. But after second time watching I understand why they handled her arc as they did. Sometimes we have to just let go and enjoy the ride. The movie itself was very enjoyable.
A Movie at Odds with itself,
Dr strange,"A big risk by Marvel, but it was a great movie the 1st act was fast and out of This world, slows down in the 2nd but picks up in the 3rd to leave u shocked and jaw dropped."
Disappointing,"It was a let down to be honest. Expected so much more.

Even the bits (no spoilers here) that should have been a ""holy moley"" bit didn't feel that special.

It probably suffers due to how good the last spiderman film. Was, and side by side this doesn't stand up."
Demonic,"So evil & demonic. Hollywood hasn't been hiding it's evil ways for years, and this just shows how demonic they are. I won't be watching anymore Marvel movies, they are a disappointment to say the least."
Marvel horror,
Awesome movie,I enjoyed the movie very much u will not get bored easily while watching this movie. The acting of the actor are very good. I am telling to enjoy the movie in the close theaters. The storyline is also good but not the best.
A Trip Through The Multiverse,
a perfect marvel film,"Well, almost. Love the way they did this movie. Story sits on shoulders of strong main character arcs. You really understand where everyone is coming from and hooked all the way. Was pleasantly surprised with Olsons performance. In general much better treatment of dramatic moments then first movie. I agree with everyone, that movie could be 10-20 minutes longer. So we would get to know America a little better and maybe glimpse into more of alternative universes. They could go deeper into the joke of him having trouble getting along with other versions of himself. Opportunity lost there. Just like it was lost in him arguing with Iron Man just for a tiny bit. Visuals are strong, though there is clearly an untaken room for something original. Humor is rare but good, and not forced like in many other cases. Good soundtrack. Contrary to cash grabs like TopGun, we have actually new story that does not feel artificial or cheesy. Want more!"
It could have been so much more,"Sam Raimi is a great director, but you can only go so far with the same tricks before it becomes unoriginal and banal. There was so much talent involved in the film, and if it weren't for the all-star cast, there wouldn't be much to enjoy. There wasn't much laughter in the theatre even when Bruce Campbell showed up, which was a shame, because if Bruce can't get a laugh, what else do you got? I'm sorry to say that yes, this film wasn't as good as it should have been. The biggest problem was the script. Prepare to cringe as certain scenes play out. I still think it is a watchable film and I will probably watch it again when it hits Disney+. Again, thank you Elizabeth Olson, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Chiwetel Ejiofor for keeping this film from sinking any lower into the depths of madness."
One of the better Marvel additions.,
Missed something,
"Boring and dumb, very much so.","They could have finished it in one hour. There is hardly and new events happening, just more fights and Wanda wins. Surprise!

Sorry your review is too short it needs to be at least 150 characters."
Too much Wanda but I think it just enough,The movie is messed up in a good way. They should have changed the title into Wanda and Steven in the Multiverse of Madness for clarity. Wanda has enough exposure her to become the main in this movie too. Two thumbs up!
Felt off,It's hard to describe the faults that this movie makes. It could have been a lot better. You can feel Sam Rameys directing at times but most of the time it feels like standard marvel cinematography. Wanda is a great character but is just not a very compelling villain. America Chaves is just a plot device that has little to no developed personality.
Watch in 3D,"I watched this movie in 3D and it was totally worth it. Dr. Strange continues to surprise us. This movie was way better than rest of his movies. Superb effects, as usual awesome action, and of course thrilling ending."
I expected worse,"In the whole this was not as bad as unexpected. Usually Disney manages to screw up existing IP, but on the whole this was an enjoyable movie.

I was a initially skeptical of the America Chavez character, but she proved to be likeable and dynamic. She was not at all the cookie-cutter diverse strong female lead that Disney usually enforces in the audience.

The effects were pretty good, and less like inception than the first film."
"All style, no substance","I was excited for the cinematic wild ride that was supposed to be the Multiverse of Madness, but ended bored out of my mind even though the movie was visually stunning. All style, no substance. Unless you are a Marvel fan that knows all the comics, the visuals will be interesting the first 15-20 minutes, but soon you will become tired of them since you simply will not be able to pay attention to the underlying story behind the madness. Someone that watches all of the Marvel movies told me that its closely connected to WandaVision. If you have not seen that I do not recommend going to the movie theater to watch this movie. It will only give you a headache."
"Really good, but still has me kinda worried",
Multiverse of Disappointment 😞,Ok so there were so many things promised to us in the trailers and none of it really paid off. So don't go with any expectations and you'll have a decent experience.
Expected more,"The special effects aren't that good to be honest, for a movie in this series, but most important is the directing, sometimes it doesn't work, some persecutions and fights seem off, the story has some very stupid moments."
Disney Destroyed Marvel,Walt Disney and Stan Lee are rolling over in their graves. The Disney company has destroyed Marvel. Our entire family has now been disappointed for the last time. Goodbye Marvel. R. I. P.
Third eye...blind,"Worst movie in the MCU. Straight up. This felt more like a video game level with no story...or it was all routine superhero stuff to set up the next better thing.

America is a cool character.

Wong is great But Dr. Strange was the one that was hard to buy. And that CGI eyeball...no one in that room felt like saying, ""bro this looks like crap, can we figure out a better solution.""

I don't need it to be an actual eye...do you? See, no one needs that youtube level special effects. Why don't you transition it into a hologram, or just have Strange Identify as a person with a third eye.

Scarlet Witch was pretty cool villian.

4/10, this movie now takes the bottom spot away from the first avenger and securely affirms...I suck."
"Great acting, special effects and cameos",
multiverse with multi doctor strange,
Marvel has made a HORROR MOVIE!!!,"Don't go with expectations of watching a superhero movie, ""anyatha aapka kat jayega"". FYI, It is an old cheap horror movie. But you will enjoy. Mainly because it has many and enough Intresting Scenes to keep you hooked to screen. Also, PLEASE WATCH ONLY IN 3D, OR IF POSSIBLE IMAX 3D. And AVOID watching in 2D version, I don't think anyone can enjoy this movie in 2D. In 2D, it will be great suffering to pass 3 hours. Don't risk your life. Please, remember I am giving 8 stars for only 3D, Horror and hot & scary Elizabeth Olsen. IT'S 3D IS NEXT LEVEL, Don't miss it. So far only Doctor Strange-1 and Infinity War were only 2 movies in MCU movies which came close to this level. Nothing Intresting about plot or acting. Wanda is a completely changed character and is playing the role of antagonist. But nothing new in story, please go and watch to enjoy horror and NEXT LEVEL 3D."
Dr. Evil Dead...,Sam Raimi should of learned his lesson from Spiderman 3. He can't do super sequels. Stick to the boom stick and your horror and your nepotism and your house. Stop making movies! Especially with Cucumberbatch. He. Like his fruity name are very low in calories and have no flavor. I'm glad I brought two cucumber slices to cover my poor eyes during the onslaught of marvel cartoons! Thank your dr strange for rejuvenating my eyes but damn you for making my remaining senses endure your two hours of torture!
Surprisingly... Bad,"This movie is possibly the worst marvel movie of them all. Poor script, poor direction, just a huge mess. Go hide in the Disney vault for a lifetime. Sam rami, stop directing already..."
"Marvel, meet Evil Dead",
As good as it was bad,"In terms of visuals, excellent but the plot holes, casting and weak cameos really ruined it.

Scarlet Witch is portrayed brilliantly dark and confused but aside from that no performance is above average and it splutters along without ever getting going. The post credit scenes and trailers pre-movie were also hugely underwhelming.

The future does not look good for my beloved Marvel."
Split Personality Disorder,"Doctor Strange suffers from multiple personality disorder. It can't decide if it's a horror flick, suspense thriller, a love story or, last but not least, a superhero movie. When attempting to do something new one must be careful not to drift too far away from what are your roots. I don't walk away from the movie feeling like I watched a superhero movie, but instead I walked away asking, what just happened?

Also, don't take a child to this movie! Definitely not suitable for young children or even young teens."
How much can be stuffed into a movie?,"There are better reviews which go through all of the plot points which I won't repeat here.

I felt like there was some meeting at Disney where a bunch of people came up with ideas of things to put in the movie from the MCU, other movies, and Disney+ shows. Some poor screenwriter had the job of stuffing all of that into 2 hours while introducing a new character who acts more like a MacGuffin than an actual person.

The result is a mess. Who's the villain? Who's the hero? How can the viewer feel anything for the characters when you know that there won't be any real consequences for their actions?"
Just not there. 6.5/10,
You will not be dissapointed!,"I just got back from the cinema. And I can say this is the best blockbuster of this year so far. Don't hesitate, go to the cinema and enjoy it right away."
A good sequel in all respects,"Going into this film I had not very many expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised with the acting and special effects. The story was quite different to what I had imagined it to be and kept me interested throughout the film, I won't spoil anything but it was a pretty good action flick and seeing some familiar faces was really epic!"
Felt rushed.,"The movie was good but with many feature films being longer, I felt this one needed to be as well. There was little to no character development, and movie itself felt rushed. The MCU series might be ruining the movies in the sense that more time is given to get emotionally involved with what is going on. The third Spiderman movie wasn't guilty of this and had far more character development. This was one of those movies that was good but should've been much better. The trailers also gave away too much of the plot. Leave some more room for surprise."
tough choice between Doctor Strange Vs Wanda,
Trying way too hard,"Watching it for the first time and I wanted to turn it off half way through. Just all out ridiculousness. At times, they just ripped off previous Marvel movies but made the characters weaker. After WandaVision, I still liked Wanda. This makes her unlikable. Even the music was generic and boring; nothing enhanced the movie. Feels like they tried too hard and ended up making just a weak movie."
Wtf did I just watch?,"I havde No words.... Its absolut madness to watch This...

Even My daughter (14yo MCU fan) Who was soooo hyped for This was like... Mjah i dont like it."
If you know what I mean then this movie is third class. Only money making after No way home.,"If you know what I mean then this movie is third class. Only money making after No way home.

If you know what I mean then this movie is third class. Only money making after No way home."
Fantastic strange!,
It felt like a cash grab,"I'm not a huge marvel fan, but I managed to watch through the entire movie. The beginning made absolutely no sense to me. It also felt like Disney wanted the viewers to watch the other films, and I don't intend on paying a cash cow a bunch of money to watch an entire series to watch a tiny movie that probably will be less impactful on the next watch."
Did anyone review this script!?,
An emotional rollercoaster through the visually stunning multiverse,"Sam Raimi is back in the MCU and it is exciting as ever. Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is an crazy emotional rollercoaster through the multiverse with Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff absolutely stealing the show.

The emotional charecter arc Wanda goes throughout the runtime of this movie is some of the most mature and dark MCU has ever been. She owns ever second she is in this movie kinda overshowing Dr Strange despita an all out performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as always.

America Chavez is also an exiting addition to this movie and brings a lot of heart and soul into it. This movie has the classic Sam Raimi signature stamped all over it, specially the horror sequences and action sequences are extremely well executed.

There is a 20 min de-rail from the main plot in the middle act of this movie that I felt was handled bit messily with a certain team of charecter, other than that it's an exiting, unique and emotional addition to the MCU and absolutely should be viewed on the big screen in 3D."
"If you want STRANGE, you will be disappointed","I am a huge fan of Doctor Strange, and this was a shocking disappointment. For one, I am exhausted with the constant effort by the MCU to shove characters sexuality in my face. I dont care if they are gay or lesbian, so can we please stop hearing about it? Secondly, this was mostly about Wanda Maximoff and her powers, with Strange fighting her with a teen sidekick, who he doesnt need. I wanted to see Strange fight one of his own villains. This was disjointed and exhausting and not fun. I hope the third move will be better."
Does the director really know what he wants to make? Whose movie is it really?,"The director didn't really understand what he wanted to show. Or he leaves it for the next part. On a Science fiction movie, he added horror supplements, black magics and so on. As a result, the movie has become a mess.

In the first half, everyone was watching on the mobile and was waiting for the interval. Because no one understood the story.

Starting part of Second half was good. But climax was just a cartoon. I thought I was watching kids fight. Where the audience wanted a lot of action, there were few action scenes which make audience disappointed.

But the main problem is this really a Dr. Strange movie? How?

I think it's a movie for Wanda. She was shown most of the time in this movie. I know she is so powerful character, the main antagonist. But the director forgot it's a Dr. Strange movie. He made the character of Dr. Strange funny. He was just for comedy. That's all he did in whole movie.

I am very much disappointed. It's just a mess."
"Low cost outsourced Marvel, or amnesic Sam Raimi","This movie is like the garbage bin from the back of the Mall foudcourt - you find in it, stuffed and partially chewed, pieces of Wandavision, Dr. Strange, Army of the Dead, Ghostbusters, even some Matrix images, 2 actors currently working under Kurtzman, Star Trek crumbs, Maleficent visuals, Fringe elements, a random Japanese landscape, some mangled Everything Everywhere All At Once ideas,and the list may go on. All on top of the other, not like referrences, nooo -.but as if someone's mind is a hoarder and finally tried to make some spring cleaning... as I said, the trash layering or chaotic mix is the general impression.

Who messed this up so bad? The lines are lame, were they written by some AI? The same one that messed up the latest Dr Who, the new Orville and Star Trek Strange New Worlds? What is going on with this weak scripts and - understandably, after all - poor lines delivery?

Superhero movies from marvel felt right, this doesn't. When their plots tap into pattern from mythology, reality and science, they click and remain anchored in something we feel authentic. Dr. Strange here is as if someone wanted to destroy that, like tear ut down, harbouring a secret hatred against superhero movies.

And no way did I want to see another Army of the Dead installation, with Marvel characters, did nobody check this movie before giving it the OK?! Like, who said, let'a mash up old things, throw in some Marvel bits and bibs and we'll be fine? Is Sam Raimi still functional, or are his wires crossed ,he forgot he alreafy did the same things - the cursed book, the zombies, the whacky one liners, the outbof nowhere character showups?

The young superhero - blatantly named America (I mean, c'mon! ""America has to be saved"" ), is structured in a haste, almost schematic, with some emotional elements glued onto a cardboard structure, sap story, ride the diversity wave, wham bam thabk you ma'am... what IS this? Testing how blinded and stupid the public has become?! There ia a strong need for pushing back, or else we'll end up with only this type of productions, that check various elements from a key list, put some filling in and feel like a plate of spam! This is not video SEO, it is suppossed to be a movie! The way it fails as a movie serves in mocking whatever elements it checked on that list...

Go see it, as an example of what it should not have been."
Dark and twisted,"I think Dr Strange must be one of my favourite hero's in the Marvel series. It's the whole fantasy and magic, which gives this character a lot of possibilities to work with. In this installment, I can also feel and understand his struggle, to mot move more and more to the dark side, as he experiments with black magic.

Loved this sequel, Sam Raimi made it darker, and it was a very entertaining movie. Yet, I was lacking something. I don't know what it was, but... the visuals were overtaking a quite mediocre story. Marvel always tries to make it more interesting to throw in some other Marvel characters... but it's just not enough for me.

Still liked it, and for a Marvel fan, recommend to see."
"From bad to much, much worse...","Just because a lot of stuff is happening, doesn't mean you have a good story. And a loooooot of stuff is happening in this one. It's just swiftly skipping from one pointless thing to another - possibly in the hopes that no one has a space long enough to realize what garbage they were watching. And it even gets worse as the story approaches the end. ""Just believe in yourself and you can do anything..."" There's no careful build-up of anything, and the motivations of some of the main characters are extremely nonsensical at best. Not to mention what a miscast that South America Chavez girl was..."
A very nice child horror movie,This is a well made child horror movie but a horrible super hero one. First time I couldn't finish a Marvel movie. I believe they wanted to make it interesting but they lost the feeling of the Marvel movies.
For those confused about Wanda...,
What can I say? They got us again...,"Sam Raimi's Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness is a movie that expands the intention of Kevin Feige to tell different narratives within the multiverse and the amplitude of stories that can be considered, on the basis of a distant reality.

However, the movie itself focuses on the story of America Chavez', which is a superhuman that can travel through the multiverse. Her powers, are not fully explained, and she is considered to be a lost kid, that has no idea of her abilities whatsoever. The only thing that we know, is that it can be a door for new universes, and a way out for when it gets tough. As for America's powers they fall on the interest of Wanda (Scarlet Witch) and Strange, after discovering that his doppelganger from the other universe was not so good after all...

Consequently, as the Scarlet Witch still possessed the 'Darkhold', the plot sets the ground for the book and the Witch to be it's main villains throughout the film. Even so, the explanation on these premises is pretty shallow, and if you are not aware of the power of the Darkhold (reading comics) you won't understand what they are actually facing.

In the same line of thought, the Scarlet Witch was not well presented, on the basis of her real power (without the amplification by the Darkhold) and the motivation that the book possess with Wanda taking control of the multiverse, considering the atrocities behind her actions.

The only characters that are well established are Stephen, Christine, and Wong, in which we all know their motivation, intentions, and overall expected behavior.

Moreover, despite this ""plot wholes"" the movie has a lot of identity on the cinematography, scenes and dialogues.

It also eventually, presents a tone of terror on the Witch scenes, and every encounter of the power of the Darkhold.

Accordingly, there is also a lot of ""fan service"" on some scenes, and the introduction of new universes, in which the establishment of the 616 World, and important traits for the well-known comic book stories (House of M, and the Iluminati for example).

Still, the terror and bold thematic of the movie, enhanced it's experience, however, by the third act you can feel how some traits were not fully explained, and how some actions by characters are at least questionable.

Overall, it is a good experience, and decent movie."
Nothing Great,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is another Marvel sequel, but this time with a more complicated plot that's not as good. In my opinion only big fans of the first will probably like this."
Not what I expected. In a good way,"I thoroughly enjoyed being surprised by the unusually dark tone of the movie the risks taken by moving away from formulas and the ""anything can happen in the multiverse"" approach."
Needs more CGI...or not!,"Wow, they really went all in on the CGI effects! I understand that it is that kind of a movie, but it's teetering on the edge of ridiculous. I love the whole Marvel Franchise and appreciate a good CGI movie, but I don't know, this one felt a little bit childish and over the top."
"Apparently, Second Time's the Charm","I saw this film on May 5, the very first opportunities I had to see it. I left that theater thinking, ""Wow. This is the first time I've ever been disappointed by a Marvel movie.""

But of course, I don't trust my opinion after one viewing, and I'm kind of a nerd, so I saw it again just yesterday.

And I'll say this as simply as possible: It was so much better.

I like to think that I'm not one of those people who didn't like the movie just because it wasn't cameo fest, but I think I definitely had some sort of expectations going in that let me down, and seeing it a second time really brought some clarity to my opinion. This isn't a big film event like Spider-Man or Avengers: Endgame. It's just a cool movie about Doctor Strange and Wanda Maximoff, and I'm actually okay with that.

Elizabeth Olsen is one of the most talented actors in film right now. I know that's a VERY bold statement, and I won't blame anyone for judging me on the strong opinion, but I truly believe that this movie proved that. Watching it having already known all the details really gave me a chance to appreciate her performance.

This is NOT a perfect movie by any means. There's a lot of things I take issues with film making wise. The ending is incredibly rushed, there's not enough time to focus on the important details. It could have benefited significantly from a few more minutes to breathe. Sam Raimi (director) admitted to not reading through WandaVision prior to starting this movie, and it really shows.

But, at the end of the day, the story and concept is enticing and well done. The characters are interesting and it's 1000 times more enjoyable without the expectation that it's Endgame/Infinity War level impressive. Upon my first viewing, I wrote a nasty review with a 6/10 rating detailing my frustrations. But, I feel content saying that my second viewing bumped it up to an 8 for me, and I'm excited to be seeing it again this weekend."
"Terrible plot, effects were good.","The plot was terrible and a lot of problems were made needlessly complicated by the characters. They make a lot of obvious time delays happen for convenience and also make characters weaker whenever it's for the plot. It was very frustrating to watch.

The effects were very nice though. I wouldn't pay to see it again. Wouldn't watch it again for free."
Multiverse of Mehdness,
Great Movie,
Just give us the Scarlet Witch film already,It's an enjoyable watch but I don't think you can call this a Doctor Strange film because its literally Wandas film with some fan service nods to other marvel universes (which we'll hopefully get expansions on) I just want them to build on Wandas story without having to piggyback her onto other films as she is probably one of the most complex characters in the marvel universe.
If you thought No Way Home was heavy on fan service,"Sam Raimi was the right director for this project. I went into this with very low expectations and really just reluctant to watch, and it didn't help that I bought the tickets for a 3D showing. It really wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.

The turmoil surrounding the production of this film really painted a bleak picture for me going into this. I don't remember how many directors and writers they went through before settling on Sam Raimi. I do remember that this was originally going to be a horror film and I think it would have been much better if they stuck with an R rated horror film instead of this superhero film ""with horror elements"" that we got. But since they went with a weird genre mix, getting Sam Raimi was an excellent choice. His background in horror and work with Spider-Man (specifically the second one) really helped this film feel coherent, and I don't think many other directors could have done such a job with the awkward parameters forced by Disney.

That being said I had almost no idea what was happening in a lot of the action sequences (and really most of the CGI heavy parts). I have seen the first Doctor Strange so I knew to expect a CGI reality bending extravaganza. But this film isn't as impressive in that aspect as I remember the first one being, though I have not watched the first one since I saw it in theaters. I really don't like time travel films and while this isn't one I still felt a little bit annoyed in a similar way.

The plot is Strange fighting the Scarlet Witch across multiple realities to save a girl who can travel across the multiverse so that Wanda won't take her powers to travel to different universes. Just typing that out makes my brain a little bit sad, even more so considering the real point of the film was to have callbacks to different movies and characters that will be in other movies. It's literally just a self referential film that bends over backwards to capitalize on fan service and it really just feels gross and annoying. This film is literally everything that The Matrix: Resurrections (2021) parodied which just made me laugh at how stupid that entire concept is. So this film being such a corporate ploy made me like that film more.

This film reminding me of another better film isn't surprising considering how much this film pays homage to the classics that we all know of. I don't know if it was Raimi or Disney that decided to remake classic shots and scenes from horror (and just general film) history, though I would guess Disney, but it really limits the potential for the film. You can tell they didn't want to try anything new or take any risks for this film. They relied heavily on references and fan service, which makes for an incredibly uninspiring film.

The ""horror elements"" in this film make me wish they would have went all in on a true horror film instead of this nonsense. But it isn't complete trash, which is really par for the MCU. It's a watchable film that could have been better. I don't think I'll ever watch this film again because it is so uninteresting."
Thank God for Elizabeth Olsen!!!,
Another fun Marvel movie,"I never expected the jump scares but I think it did add a lot to the movie. This movie was so creative, especially the use of different universes but the editing sometimes seemed overdone. I loved the storyline though, as well as the acting and I am excited for future movies!!"
Sam Raimi couldn't save this movie.,"I was excited to see what Sam Raimi could do with this movie, but it felt like he was held back by Disney. It's convoluted and the writing is cringe. The ""Marvel Formula"" is getting old! Elizabeth Olsen is not that good in this, which sucks since she is great in other marvel projects. Cumberbatch and Xochitl Gomez both do an okay job. Nothing special here, just another contrived mess. The visuals are on point. A lot of talent being put on screen and some of the Horror-esque elements added by Raimi were fun. That's all to praise."
Worst!!!!,"There are no words to describe how terrible this film is. Bring back the old quality of Marvel!!!

You already have nothing to think of?

It seems that you have no more ideas and you are creating some kind of nonsense I wouldn't even recommend this movie to adults!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I fear we might have peaked at Endgame...,
A refreshing change in tone.,Sam Raimi has his fingers in a lot of this movie and that made this so refreshing. Horror and violence is introduced here and is unlike anything you've seen before in MCU. There are maybe one too many characters to balance that end up taking away from Doctor Strange's character arc. Very enjoyable and I hope Sam Raimi is here to stay.
Not that bad but not as good as expected.,"Overall I did enjoy this movie as I do most of the MCU. IMO, this was not the ""horror movie"" we were promised. It had one scene that I would have considered a ""jump scare.""

Could it have been better? Maybe Could it have been worse? Probably not

Might need to rewatch it."
Perfect and mind-blowing! Dark & thrilling! 👍👍,"I've seen the ""What If"" episodes on Disney+. We definitely explored more of the multiverse than we ever imagined. Marvel has definitely worked hard on this project to give the fans and audience the chills and thrills. This film has non-stop action and it has scary moments. This film is even darker than the first one I've seen in 2016. There are some funny moments and a cameo that I laughed at. I won't spoil that cameo in detail. The other cameos are amazing so I won't spoil them as well. Sam Raimi did a good job directing this film. He did directed the Spider-Man trilogy and it's no wonder that Marvel wanted him to come back and direct another superhero film. Danny Elfman's composing for this film is phenomenal. The special effects blew my mind away and there are a lot of great shots to view. The ending took me by surprise so I'm not going to spoil that part. I definitely want to go beyond the multiverse."
Good story until political wokeness,"Story and effects were standard Marvel.

Then around 43 minutes into the movie the Hollywierd writers showed up with their LGBTQ+xyz message around 43 minutes into the movie.

So unnecessary. Seems movies and life can't exist in 2022 without a full representation of every woke faction."
Too converluted for its own good,"Seriously flawed sequel that is more a set up for other films than its own entry with Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen doing their best in a converluted special effects spectacle that hurts the marvel universe more than it helps and it even manages to contridict other movies and shows like the first Doctor Strange, Loki and Wandavision. I love a good marvel movie like everyone else but they better start to get a firm grip on their films before they start losing fans. This film I hope is not setting a new trend."
Probably my favorite Strange movie,"To be honest I didn't know what to expect. I didn't even watch the trailers for this movie but of course watched everything marvel up to this point (which I recommend you do before seeing this). I did like the movie and the acting. It had a good plotline, cinematography, and all the rest of the cinematic check boxes. To me this was showcasing Dr. Strange to his fullest which I liked but also Wanda. Suprisingly it wasn't a total head trip or super hard to follow movie if you just paid attention and didn't have interruptions. The only things that were unexpected where all the darker elements/parts of the movie where I was like Oh so marvel IS going there.. without spoilers I'd watch this before letting smaller kids watch it to make your judgement calls. However besides all that it was at the very least entertaining if you care about the marvel movies/world. I recommend watching it if you have the chance, but don't expect some cinematic masterpiece from it. It's marvel and it delivered as expected and maybe just a bit more given that to me it's the best Dr. Strange based movie yet to come."
Good Movie but It's A 1st Horror Film for MCU,"We Went to See with My Mom and My 2nd Brother. And My Mom Said, It's A Witchcraft Movie. And My 2nd Brother Likes The Movie So Much. And My Mom Pray to God Before We Enter Our House to Not Let The Devil Comes for Us. So If You Are Christian, Please Be More Careful to See This Because The Devil is Coming for You to Possessed. So, You Must Pray and Take Care Yourself. For Me is, It Was Great Film. And Remember, Good Luck to Watch This If You Are About to See It!"
"They wasted so much in the movie, what were they thinkong ?",
Is this the welcome mat to the next phase of the MCU?,"The MCU started off avoiding magic, as they thought it would alienate viewers. In Thor, the thunder god says 'Your Ancestors Called it Magic, but You Call it Science. I Come From a Land Where They Are One and the Same.' and that went through all the films, even the first Dr Strange. Kevin Feige talked a lot about how that was based on quantum physics, and they even had a university professor - Adam Frank - as scientific consultant. This film feels like it's destroyed all that for zombies and demons.

Cumberbatchs Dr Strange is practically the last grown up Avenger left, and as such has big responsibilities to the world. Here he's trying to protect a young, um, powered - for all we know, the MCU may class her as a mutant, given they now they have access to those characters - being, who is being chased down by demons for her powers. And that is the problem with this film; we all know that mutants, Fantastic Four, Deadpool and all the other former Fox properties are coming, and the multiverse gives an in universe way to get them there. It's a pretty big issue having the Illuminati - Patrick Stewart, Hayley Atwell, Anson Mount, Lashana Lynch, John Krasinski - in the film, because they couldn't all be there together before. They're just not the main characters, and like every other MCU solo movie title, it's that titular character whose job it is to be the closer.

As with every MCU film, the graphics are on the grand scale; from Kamar Taj to alien planets, to a montage of multiverse travel, it's all become expected. The soundtrack allows Danny Elfman to show his abilities, especially with one noticeable battle.

It's a Marvel film and you will likely see it for that reason. Comparing it to the original, this is a hot mess."
Two moms. YAWN,"Great effects, rushed script, brilliant monsters. Good acting, Elizabeth Olsen is gorgeous. However, America has two moms. Virtue signalling c**p. It's so boring now."
Disappointing on some many levels,
Failed to live up to expectations,"This was a visually pleasing film and I enjoyed it, but it did not live up to expectations. This film barely dipped it's toes into the multiverse and did not take any real risk."
Multiverse of Wokeness,"Story lacks any direction. Acting is subpar & just seems like Marvel has lost all its momentum post Endgame. The cameos were wasted opportunities & it the whole movie didn't make much sense. The CGI was average. The biggest eye roll was the LGBTQ pin on America's jacket that of course had to say ""Love is Love"" in Spanish. Just wish Hollywood would stop being so disconnected from the rest of the world & stop trying to force this woke narrative down everyone's throat."
Loved it,"Don't understand the negative comments. I loved every minute of it. Sam Raimi's still got it. Dr Strange and Wanda were both great and I liked the multiverse story. Some really cool creative ideas, lots of amazing effects. For me it was up there with the best Marvel movies. Definitely in my top 5 now."
Unsatisfying And Corny,"The sequel of Doctor Strange movie has finally arrived. Despite all the expectations, Marvel brought us to a frankly disappointing experience.

Though the title is multiverse and madness, but turn out it's just a trip through CGI, superficial plot and corny horror. All cameo who appear in this movie shows no significant role or any contributions to the story line but obvious fan service.

The movie just wants to be strange and mad just like its name but didn't seem to be very sucessful. All you can see the movie is just pure entertainment (although it tried to be different among other Marvel's movies by being labeled horror) and can be exhausting."
Paisa barbaad bc,"I will start with the good part the animation was pretty good and acting was also decent. And rest of the movie is just madness. The plot of the movie itself is mad. May be story writer is mad thats why they calling it multiverse of madness. I waa expecting more explanation on multiverse and travelling through it. But they just dumped it with dream walking. LoL.

Movie in one sentence WANDA IS MAD."
worst writing of all the marvel movies,"I've never been so disappointed in any marvel movie than with this one. Maybe michael waldron should've been less concerned with making a horror movie and more into writing a decent story- it was a total mess. Literally took my 4 sessions to complete because I was so put off by how bad the writing was- maybe sam raimi should've been more concerned with the logistics of telling a story rather than the overzealous use of CGI. The plot sucked, the climax sucked and the whole film was just miserable to watch."
Rushed and forcibly dark,
"The directing and acting are wonderful, but suffer greatly from a lacking screenplay","This movie serves as a great opening title to Sam Raimi's return as a director to a Marvel movie. He points a figurative ""middle finger"" to Disney's creative restrictions, by directing with his own unique style, following the footsteps of his very first dip in movies: that of the horror element. However, he doesn't do it with a silly or stupid way, but one that makes you chuckle, almost perversely, to the violence (something never seen to such extend in a Marvel movie, until now). Adding to that effect is the fact that he doesn't linger on senseless overuse of effects on the universes or character's abilities, but he uses them frugally, letting the characters carry the scenes. Even if he is a bit over the top, I found that I sorely missed a Raimi-touched Marvel movie.

Now, on to the characters, they are the ones that carry a well directed movie with a submarginal screenplay. Elisabeth Olsen is simply superb, offering a performance of a grieving mother that is capable of not only melting the heart of the coldest viewer, but to make them sympathise with her disastrously taken path. Under Raimi's guidance, we see a different, insane and utterly dangerous Wanda, with Olsen transferring her emotional weight tremendously well. Benedict Cumberbatch is equally emotive, witty and simultaneously tragic, giving his special touch in all of the different variations of Doctor Strange we see in the film. The secondary characters are handled well and, fortunately, without interfering much in the main battle between Wanda and Strange.

Is it the best movie in Phase 4? I believe so. That alone says a lot, however, about the (lacking) quality of the Phase, and the stakes it strives to reach. As such, MoM is not perfect. It has its issues, mostly residing within the mediocre to bad screenplay. America Chavez appears in the beginning without any explanation or reason, a lot of the outcomes feel childishly, conveniently settled, and the ending was seriously underwhelming given what we've went through the entire movie. It feels as if Michael Waldron and Jade Bartlett, the screenwriters, wanted to just get done with it. It's such a shame because both the actors and the director deserved much more than such a half - assed attempt.

I give it 7 stars. It's not perfect, but it's most certainly fun. If you watch it without high expectations, you'll certainly enjoy it."
It was Okay,
GOOD LORD,This movie was an absolute cluster. I am dumbfounded that this saw a release & I'm truly at a loss for words ha- not sure what else to say. Shocked there's as many positive reviews as I've seen so far. It started to make more sense once I remembered Sam Raimi directed. Lord help us.
Casual viewer here,"I know that there are a lot of reviewers here who are huge Marvel fans, but as a casual filmgoer, who has seen the character Doctor Strange in some other Marvel films that my boyfriend dragged me to (and that I fell asleep to, on occasion), I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I watched in IMAX and I was blown away by the visual effects, the villain was FABULOUS (werq, queen!) and the different universes kept me on my toes. I hadn't watched the previous instalment of ""Doctor Strange"" but that didn't make the plot confusing. Yeah some of the plot lines have a few gaps, but once I suspended my disbelief when I entered the cinema (because it's a superhero film, you have to) they didn't bother me. Oh and at two hours long, it was perfect for me."
"Not much madness, verses or point","I have watched every Marvel film. Every Sony offshoot.

There is much to struggle with here.

The film, from a so so start, to a shrug of the shoulders end credit scenes (two of them)....all of it is just unmemorable.

Heavy on background music to entice pathos, emotion etc. Danny Elfman can't be faulted....but that's all manufactured to make you feel something.

And you don't. You don't care.

The music is doing the heavy lifting when that job should have been done by the script.

The whole adventure is silly (not madness), lacking in verses (three or four is hardly multi) and the not too overt metaphor for America.....literally the country.....which is embodied in the form of a teenage girl.

Portals are opened. Doors are broken. A darkness takes hold and there is the book of vishanti (truth - vis-à-vis facts).

It all smacks of a script written during Trump's mad rule of America.

The dialogue has double meanings throughout. It all sounds just like a commentary on America and it's divisions.

I thought the first Dr. Strange was ok but this can't seem to reach that bar.

Lots of CGI wizz and bangs but none of it is very deep.

It's like a follow up to Wandavision rather than Dr. Strange.

Directed by Sam Raimi, it reminded me of the same feeling I had when I watched Spider-Man 3 (Tobey McGuire version), also directed by Sam.

There's a lot of stuff in it....lots of everything....but nothing of substance. Just disappointing.

It may have been a better film if they had delved more deeply into one of two aspects. But they don't.

The film is less multiverse of madness and more multitude of meh.

To see how to have fun with madness, watch Venom : Let there be carnage. Not a deep film but by God multiply more fun than this.

If you're a Marvel fan, you'll watch this BUT lower your expectations (a lot) and you may enjoy it.

TBF, the inclusion of some ""extra"" characters is enjoyable to see but it all looks like a set up for future Marvel movies."
Beautiful visuals but dark and full of wokeness,"I am a big fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, but he didn't even seem like he was the main character and having Sam Raimi direct this Marvel film was a HUGE mistake, regardless of how talented he may be. His vision and execution of this film made the movie dark like DC's Batman, the storyline was hard to follow, and crammed with wokeness. I didn't care for Elizabeth Olsen's character or acting. Disney better wake up and take a few cues from Top Gun: Maverick - entertain, but leave the politics at home. I saw this movie on Disney+ and would not recommend paying to see this movie in the theater."
Trash you'll never believe,This honestly don't seem like a marvel movie that we used to know. Too much madness and not enough logical explanation that we see from the previous marvel movies. The characters power levels seemed to be off the chart. Director threw everything here and there. Throughout the movie you feel like 'why does this happen and why not?'. Could've been better.
Yellow Baby Trolley,
An excellent rendition that might not be everyone's cup of tea,"While some might not enjoy the latest installment of Doctor Strange I certainly did.

It's a blast for Raime fans with loads of fan service, a great cast, story and visual extravaganza.

You do need your brain present and senses tuned for this one as it's a twisted ride but we'll worth it.

Pros: Fleshed out story that has heart, suspense a nd thrills galore.

Visually stunning and leaves you in awe at times.

Lots of needed character development.

Cons: As the target audience is a bit young, it feels a bit childish at times.

Ending could have been more epic.

Some supporting cast is not given the time to really shine."
One of the best marvel movies!!!,"This movie is better than spider man no way home. That doesn't make spiderman a bad movie however. They are both super great but let's be honest here. People wanted to see variants that had an appearance in previous marvel movies to call this movie a 10/10. I mean that's what spider man did, imagine spiderman without the two spider men from before, people wouldn't love the movie as much as they did even tho it's a fantastic movie. The rumours of having like 9999+ characters from different marvel movies appearing in this single movie with a lot of different variants, made the movie disappointing for a lot of people since only two characters from marvel movies other than the mcu appeared. Don't trust rumours because you will get disappointed when you see that they aren't true."
Much better than The Batman!,
Liking this movie is a failure to cinema,"I must admit, I am not a fan of the MCU in general. Antman, Gardians, Ranarok were all wins for me. That said, this movie was a fundamental fail, starting from the script. There seems to be only two points to the movie. Fight some outrageous CGI monster, or two people standing around expelling exposition. That really is it. So if you want to just watch a horrible CGI fight and the be spoon fed why that fight was important, this will be the Citizen Kane movie for you."
Madness and chaos in a very short period..... confusing?,"This is a odd movie to review. From a effects and action stand point, its mind blowing. You feel the madness, the chaos, the multiverse come to life.

There is ALOT of things you didn't see in the trailer. So much stuff that you are sort of bombarded with it non-stop. Alot of people like Strange have crazy amounts of powers now which may or may not confuse you or wonder ""Why didn't they do this before?"".

Then you have new girl whos power is kind of really boring frankly. I mean I enjoy the idea of what she can do and indeed does in the movie, but if her story was a lone movie, I'd probably skipped it. And as much as they try to make her somewhat of the main focus, you don't care all that much about her or her powers.

The funnest aspect of this movie is seeing Scarlet Witch and Dr Strange showing off some new stuff. I can't go into detail as this is a non-spoiler review. But I will say I was super impressed with all the new stuff we see. Especially a call back to the ""What If"" series but not animated.

Now, why is the movie only a 7? For as wonderful as this movie is, it feels rushed given it barley runs under two hours. This should have also been extended in length so it felt less rushed, chaotic and confusing. This is not to say you don't know whats going on per say, but everything moves so fast you don't really get time to rest and think about what just happened.

I know some were disappointed with a big scene that we seen in a trailer and where it lead. But I wasn't. It was nice seeing this scene and knowing how much more it opens up the future of the MCU. The ending was also something I was ok with. With the MCU you never know what to expect in the future.

I will say this movie is much darker then any other MCU movie. It really felt like a MCU meets horror mix. Which was amazing in many ways. But I don't think little kids could handle this as it would likely be very scary for them. And, again without spoiler, this is the second time you get a gruesome scene in the MCU (all be it not fully shown), it might be to much for kids.

Obviously given movie wise the last movie before this was SpiderMan, I am comparing them to each other in terms of which I liked more. Spider Man blew my mind. But then again so did this. I'd say they are tied in terms of how great they are. Again though, this movie should have been closer to Spider Mans runtime.

If you still are undecided, I highly recommend seeing this in the theaters. The effects and sound design just won't be as good on a tv."
Very meh,
A horror fantasy movie for adults,"This is nothing like the other movies. It's dark and tragic and scaaary. The story had a good pace, great dialog that carries the plot. The action sequences were creative and not too drawn out. A little bit of propaganda sprinkled in, but overall, the message was timeless and positive."
Most Disappointing MCU Movie I Have Seen to Date,"I wish I could give this film a half star because there was literally only 5% of the movie that I actually enjoyed.

Story was all over the place and way too dark. MCU movies in my opinion are for the family to enjoy but I would not dare let a kid watch this movie.

I also found the movie boring, pointless to the MCU story as a whole, and confusing

Even though I am a huge fan of No Way Home, I am on the train with those that think the MCU needed to end a few movies ago. Was a big fan for many many years and it has just turned into a money making machine."
Fun but flawed. See it for Wanda.,"If you finished Wandavision and are jonesing for more then this movie is for you. I enjoyed it but I can't give it an eight, especially compared to better mcu movies.

Doctor Strange is a unique comic book experience. An opportunity to see colorful bizarrities scrawled page after page. An overload of stylized forms. It's great.

This just doesn't impress when the medium is cgi. It becomes noise. Tiresome noise."
Disappointing,One of the most hyped Marvel movie in recent times but the film failed to meet the expectations of fans. The story I would say was average. Cameos are ruined by the makers. Wanda aka Scarlet Witch deserves all the appreciation. She nailed her role. The film is well made in terms of visuals. Enjoyed the visuals in 3D. But the film lacked in Story.
Sam Rami Back In The Comic Book Genre,"The Good- Now Sam Rami is easily one of the most influential and important directors in the comic book movie. In this film Sam Rami shows what he can do when give creative freedom. Fair enough the opening act has the same old MCU formula like most of its films. But in the second and third act he is able to really showcase what he can do as a director, not only in the comic book genre but also t horror genre as well. I was surprised how dark they could go with this film while also still being able to keep it as a PG-13. We continue to explore the heartbreak of Wanda's journey. Elizabeth Olsen continues to showcase the her acting range as she shows this heartbroken character that is also terrifying. While the plot is a follow up to WandaVision, the character ark and exploration is focused on Doctor Strange and you get a clear idea of where he is at post-Endgame and how he has evolved as a character since that first Doctor Strange film. The new addition to this film America Chavez, who is essentially used as a plot device, is a plot device done right. Although she is there to move the plot forward she has the charm and chemistry with Doctor Strange and is enjoyable to watch on screen but her set of powers are used to move the plot forwards. Lastly we're going to talk about the cameos. Now unlike No Way Hone this film isn't built on the idea of merging three different franchises together that being said there were obviously opportunities to bring back some familiar faces. And when these sequences happened I had a massive grin across my face. One face certainly caught me off guard that I did not expect. I'm glad this did not end up being a cameo centric movie but still had some fun with the multi-verse. There's so many things in this film that I'm glad were mad a part of the MCU.

The Bad- The movie feels like it was by two different directors. The first 40 minutes is your generic MCU film and I was saying to myself 'this doesn't feel like a Sam Rami film' and then as you get into the back half of the film it is very distinctly a Sam Rami film. With a bunch of the creatures and the way he visualises horror aspects. While it has some of the visual horror rami stuff. The visuals feel like a massive step down from the first Doctor Strange film. The story is fairly straightforward and moves at a pretty fast pace which is why the film is fairly short compared to recent MCU films. I appreciate that not every MCU film needs to be 2 and a half+ hours long. When your call your film this there's an expectation that there's going to be a lot of multiverse and a lot of madness. While a lot of these recent comic book films could of been cut 10,15 minutes this is one that could have added 10,15 minutes.

What I will say is that Sam Rami clearly brought his A game when directing. He clearly didn't have a lot of freedom when it came to structuring the story due to him being brought in late in production. I can imagine a version of this that would have be a lot better if they had given Rami more time and freedom on the story.

Overall I'm going to give 'Doctor Strange Into The Multiverse Of Madness' a 8/10 and if you are an MCU fan I would recommend watching it but go in with limited expectations."
Someone farted and this movie came out,"An utterly disappointing, discombobulated mess of a script with a weak plot and homage to Satanic cult and evil rituals and themes.

We want our 3 hours and money back.

This movie is the perfect example of the worst of Hollywood. Would leave zero stars if that was an option.

I kept looking at my watch wondering how much longer until the movie was over. Was not enjoying it at all. Was bored through most of it.

Without a doubt the worst Marvel movie ever, and arguably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Absolutely hated this movie. We almost walked out of the theater.

Did not feel like a Marvel movie. No fun, just a clot of terrible writing, confusion, and uncomfortably dark themes. Would NOT take the kids to this one. Well, I won't be taking ANYONE because I'll never watch it again."
Good 72%,
Average with some entertaining parts,"I think I would rate this between a 6 and 7 out of 10. The movie follows Dr Strange and a new multiverse traveler as they try to stop Wanda/Scarlet Witch from controlling the multiverse. As everyone has seen from the movie trailer, Scarlet Witch has pretty much taken over Wanda and is the nemesis of the movie. The movie has its entertaining moments and is a pretty simple story to follow. But it also has some cringe worthy story lines throughout and some even more cringe worthy acting in parts. Of course the best parts include the different multiverse characters, but those moments are short lived. I was hoping there would be more Marvel Zombie action, but that turned out to be a huge disappointment with terrible CGI. It was almost laughable. Since the movie is free now on Disney+, it's worth a watch. But in the end, it's a one and done. Side note, you don't really have to watch the Wanda show on Disney first, but maybe read a recap of it because the reason this whole thing is happening is due to the end of that show."
Ehhhh,Dr. Strange writers were handed a layup from Spider Man No Way Home and they missed. The movie had potential but it never went anywhere and some of the scenes were very choppy with poor transitions...I'm also disapointed in the special efx and costumes. Some of the super hero uniforms looked like Halloween costumes from Wish. I just expect so much more quality from a billion dollar company. If your loyal to the Marvel franchise you will still want to watch just dont expect to be blown away.
Here the Multiverse makes sense but not for Spiderman!,This is a great movie with a fantastic lead actor. I don't get why people like Spiderman No Way Home so much as it does literally make no sense why Spiderman has anything to do with the Multiverse. Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness is a way better movie. Spiderman can keep shooting nets out of whatever body parts he likes while Dr. Strange should handle the Multiverse. Period.
Has a few Tricks up it's Sleeve,"Viewed at the cinema (in 3D)

I want to preface this by saying that while there certainly is a discussion to be had around the merits of tying a film('s narrative) to a preceding tv miniseries, a review is ultimately a reflection of the viewer's experience, and as someone who had already watched said miniseries, this aspect didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the film.

So yeah, on to the film itself, and I have to say I quite enjoyed it. I personally liked the fact that a certain ""reveal"" came as early as it did that way we could get to the nitty gritty of the adventure without bloating it with a bunch of exposition, and it was a pretty fun time with quite a few entertaining encounters. Sure, it could have been more, especially in the cameo department, but what is here was still pretty fun, and I'm looking forward to what kind of developments this will lead too.

Also, while I'm not going to harp on about it, I did see it in 3D, which is a format that the film's style of special effects really plays well with & is elevated by, IMO. Maybe I'll deduct a point for the 2D version, but we'll see how it holds up when it hits streaming."
5/10,Disney you got to stop rushing everything like you're not ahead of the game already. Trust me DC and WB won't ever be able to catch up. I've seen WandaVision pretty good up till the end. Don't rush creating a villain. Especially a character we don't get much focus on. Wanda has been in a lot of stuff but always as a side character. Her quick descent into her evil side felt rushed and choppy. A hot mess but entertaining none the less.
Corny mess,"This entire movie had me questioning everything. Brutal script/brutal acting/brutal CGI.

Why would they make ms Gomez call herself America? Dumb. All of the other superhero's were brutal. Brutal movie all together."
Better Than the first one!!!,"I wasn't a huge fan of the first Dr. Strange film. The truth is I really am not a fan of the character. I'm more a fan of the traditional superhero crime fighters that wizards and witches. I enjoyed the visual style of the first Dr. Strange but the film wasn't very involving. When I saw that Sam Raimi was the director of this new film I was very happy with that because Raimi is a good choice for this kind of story. He has a visual style and sense of humor that is uniquely his so I had elevated expatations.

We I saw the new film today and I do feel it is an improvement on the first Dr. Strange. The character is still not my favorite character but Benedict Cumberbatch has made the character his own. The cast is pretty good also. Especially Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff. Xochitl Gomez plays America Gomez. A being that has the power to travel through the multiverse. She tells Strange that she is being chased by demons because of her power. It turns Wanda is responsible for the attacks so Dr Strange tried to protect America. To explain what goes on would be difficult and their lies one of my problems with the film. Because this is a multiverse story where there are alternate realities and you see different versions of the same character it's hard to get really involved with the story on an emotional level. There is too much going on to get involved with the characters. It is a Marvel film but I think they are so much better when you care about the what's going on with the characters in the story. Sam Raimi directs this with great energy and does add horror elements which are his specialty but I wish he would have been given some more control. I suspect he was held back by studio execs on not going to far with some of the more disturbing elements of the story.

Overall it is an entertaining Marvel film though.

Grade: B."
A Hot Mess,
"Great, but could have easily been better","This film had so many amazing individual scenes, that were just paced so weirdly that they didn't really end up feeling relevant to the plot of the film. So many parts of the film were met with such positive review from the audience, and yet when the film ended it just felt a bit... empty? VERY mixed feelings for this movie, maybe it'll be better on a second watch.

Edit: I feel like if it were the first half of a Dr Strange film it would be spectacular, it's just missing the second half lol."
A Multiverse of Boredom,"Such a boring, cookie cutter script. What a tedium, what a previsible plot EVEN with all the absurd ideas included just to make it feel modern, inclusive, multicultural.

It's amazing how bad cinema can be when big data is all that counts.

Listen... I love cheesy movies. But this is a different league."
You will love if you like Wanda,"I like this one. The story is interesting and even though a superhero movie, the human part of the protagonist is what we all may connect to, too scary. But I guess CGI is getting worse movie by movie, in the context that it clearly seems the real characters arent actually there. The visuals were good. The queen, Scarlett witch ruled like one. Wong seemed not upto the mark of being the Sorcerer Supreme. Maybe redemption for Doctor strange, he was dealt badly in ""No way home."" Multiverse is wide open now."
The Marvel Movie Machine almost ruined this one,"Do you ever feel like you're watching a movie, and it's just acting as a setup for several related TV shows and other films in the franchise? Unfortunately, this movie got dangerously close to becoming that. Thankfully, the story's heart (the relationship between America Chavez, Dr. Strange, and Christine Palmer) held it together.

The visuals are plentiful in this movie, including good pacing, action, and characters. Dr. Strange feels a little tired at this point (how many times has he appeared in the MCU up to this movie?), but his character isn't dull as much as what feels like more of the same. Thankfully, Sam Raimi adds some distinction with his proficiency in horror to not make this all an endless CGI-fest. If you've ever watched Evil Dead, you'll quickly see Sam's imprints on this movie, and they were the best scenes. I can only hope he continues directing MCU movies.

As for those sacred easter eggs, they felt meaningless. But because this is the MCU, I wouldn't be surprised if that one reference to that one character in that one frame is a setup for another Marvel TV show. I hope not because all the in-Universe references are getting a little out of hand. I understand that it's the ""Multiverse of Madness,"" but not all the energy needs to go into more pop culture and comic book references that only a small fanatic audience would understand.

It's incredibly entertaining, but story and lore-wise seem like ""another Marvel movie."" I don't hate it, but I wish the movie had more impact on the overall MCU rather than being a stepping stone to more significant events. If you watched the ""Loki"" TV show, that series felt like it had more impact by its last episode than the ending of this movie. I guess we'll have to wait for the next Marvel movie in the next 2-3 months and see what happens."
"Terrible movie, fell asleep from boredom.","The title speaks for itself

ps. Why was the portal a blu st*r.

Ps. Why was the script so bad ps. Why do they keep butchering the universe ps. It didnt live up t the expectations ps. Who the fick is America and why is she a bad actress?

Ps. Why did the music suck?

Ps. The musical battle was lame as hell.

Ps. Im done."
"Visually beautiful, but not much in the way of plot","In the end, I was quite disappointed. Visually, it's a blast at certain moments and it's a blast to watch. But that's where it kind of ended for me. The music was good, but nothing that made me sit my ass down. The action scenes were great too, but then again, there have been better ones in Marvel. It was the story that took the biggest hit. It's pretty weak in my opinion, and unfortunately this vice is starting to repeat itself. I first noticed this with Spider-Man: No Way Home, but it didn't matter in the finale, because it was all taken care of by a trio of our favorite Spider-Men who pulled the whole movie off, and besides, the action was on another level with better music. I actually noticed this earlier with Venom: Let There Be Carnage, where it just didn't quite work out. Then after a while came the failed Morbius and now this. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness came out even better thanks to its aforementioned visuals, which made the film interesting. Otherwise, it would probably have been above average. It's a shame. I understand that they want to show us something grandiose in the form of effects at every corner, but we shouldn't forget about the quality of the plot, which I don't think is bad here, but definitely weaker compared to other Marvel movies. Historically, this has been done in Avengers: Infinity War, for example, where action and good looks were plentiful while not forgetting a good plot with a good story. Here, it went a bit to hell for me as far as the writing goes, and in my opinion, that's the biggest minus of the new Doctor Strange. For me, a good movie that I recommend more to just the bigger fans of the Marvel world. For the average viewer, I would only recommend this movie if they want some eye candy and aren't looking for a deeper plot."
"I knew it was going to be bad, but I didn't know how bad.",
Worse and worse..,"Marvel universe is getting messed up.. This film was like watching scooby doo with the exception that this one wasn't funny or interesting.. Completely disinterested film, the viewer never gets involved or feels that he cares what happens, cheap scary scenes and non-existent plot. Dissapointment!"
Not as bad as everyone says,
Really good.... Visually,
100% Sam Raimi,"Even when this movie starts to fail on a writing level near the third act, Raimi's stellar direction takes over making up for the flaws in the script."
Not very multiverse-y (also Western imperialist as usual),"Meh, another throwaway superhero movie. The trailer made it seem like it was far more multiverse-y than it was. Good choice not seeing it in the cinema.

And really when you think about it, it just continues the Empire's propaganda that fundamentally it's always white-man/white-woman from US/UK, military-sector/private-sector, who ""saves the world"", when those are historically the types who have done the most to destroy the world."
Multiverse madness crossed gendres,"When you make a movie about multiple universes and multiple timelines within a related movie franchise you have complexity.

The movie mentions Dr Strange's recent time with Spider-Man and puts this new adventure in that context.

With a multiverse you have lots of scope for alternative versions of the Marvel world. Alternative heroes and alternative Dr Strange's.

The plot and the complexity was well executed. Acting was convincing and sold. Action and effects was great.

Where I have an issue was the horror element. It was mild horror but. In my view, unnecessary."
Clash of creators created a multiverse of mess with no substance,"I'll preface this by saying I'm not a casual viewer, and have multiple watches of every piece of MCU media, except one. Loki. (Which was poorly written, poorly acted and felt like a departure from the character we actually knew and liked)

The person who wrote/created/produced Loki also wrote MoM. If like me you're curious and look into his credentials for ""is this person someone who should be a lead on a marvel project"" the answer is an overwhelming no and the proof is in the pudding.

Michael Waldron had ONE writing credit to his name when getting the job, one episode of Rick and Morty (season 4, as we all know that's when it declined). Upon realising that suddenly the absolute mess of both this and Loki made sense. It has not been written by someone who understand narrative, character arcs or plot. This film pulls you from one scene to another with no more explanation than ""because we said so"". Now, this style works for Rick and Morty, like it or loathe it the off the wall episodes have a cult following for a reason. The MCU cannot fit that mold, there is far too much background and media to ask the audience just to accept the characters odd choices as logical. We know these characters and have done for some time, to change them so dramatically with no arc or explanation is insulting to casual and devout viewer alike. The characters feel wrong, intrinsically, and nothing like we know or recognise and actively destroys previous well executed character arcs (eg wandavision). The only good thing going for the movie is the actors do their best with what they have in light of a truly awful, cringe worthy and eye rollingly bad script, not that it helps much. Olsen particularly does a very good job portraying Wanda's insanity, but pointing out the pure sexism of her character is for another essay (of course Michael Waldron believes even the baddest witch in town seeks only to be a suburban housewife - yawn)

With marvel sometimes you have to take things with a pinch of salt and suspend your disbelief a touch and trust the process- we all survived the dark world right. Dialogue can be a place where the MCU falls flat, in MoM this was on another level and truly there was nothing to distract you, the fights are littered by groan worthy quips and no characters come through with any personality or intelligence. ""But surely"" I hear you shout ""surely the CGI is worth the ticket price"", And yet,it is some of the worst I've seen of any movie- not just marvel (and yes I am including spy kids in this).

From the first frame you feel as though you're watching a pirated copy, the cgi is noticeable and is fourth wall shattering. You're completely aware you're watching a (poor) movie and it makes it incredibly difficult to feel immersed, beck everything does here. Even very small things like the costuming and makeup fell flat, the women are all in heels with distractingly bad makeup even Stranges beard looked like it would peel off any second.

Then came the cameos, and more cameos, and more cameos slowly becoming egregious and add quite literally nothing to the plot, for once no one reacted, at this point you're both so overwhelmed and bored in equal amounts that the cameos fall flat, luckily they don't stick around.

At no point did a smile nor a speck of seratonin cross my mind during what ended up feeling like a true never ending experience.

Overall I feel as though this film was a tale of two filmmakers with incredibly stylised visions. This clash of creators could have seen on paper as a rip roaring ride of a true multiverse of madness, only it didn't work. Michael Waldron had a vision that felt like a Rick and morty episode, and Sam Raimi wanted to do an mcu Evil Dead, as such parents might want to rethink bringing any yunguns. Objectively both of those are truly terrible ideas even taken separately. Together it makes the mess we were given I still am not sure what we even watched. Was it Doctor Strange? No. Was is a continuation of Wandavision? Also no. Was it a horror film? No. MCU? Definitely not.

After the trailer it felt like a bait and switch, leaving the theatre I felt robbed of my time, robbed of my money and robbed of that feeling of joy I usually have after watching a marvel film in cinema, my fondness for the mcu has definitely taken a hit.

In true marvel cinema style there was a moment where the theatre cheered almost as loud as Endgame, unfortunately it was when it ended- I was one of them."
Marvel is cursed,
Good movie,
Terrible,"Very unlike a marvel movie, dark and humourless and overall too serious. The plot is silly and far fetched, its not as good as the previous dr strange movie, or the brilliant spiderman multiverse movie. No real build up and just rushed through."
DSMOM,
Grr spoilers,
Nonsense and lost in its own universe,
Straight garbage!!!,The story is convoluted! They were trying to do to much. Nothing about this movie worked. Very disappointing. I guess Marvel and Disney we're trying to be woke and ended up collapsing a great comic.
You messed up one of my favorite characters,"You had a huge buildup from Spiderman No way Home. But it lacked something very important. The EPIC factor and lots of the Scarlet Witch's roles were awful tbh. I boil it down to the writing and not the acting. Actor was good, but who decides some of these scenes.

The only thing that was great about the movie was Doctor's Strange out of box idea and even that was a stretch.

I think the movie was too colorful and bright. I think the first movie's scenery was darker maybe and had a more mysterious effect about them. This movie had more gore and did have some good action moments, but that was it really.

Even though we're watching fantasy, I'd like to believe there is a fine balance in fantasy. Too much or too extreme, you miss the audience. Too little and too realistic, it becomes a chore to watch. Try to find the balance is the key and that's what will make the next movie great. But after this one, I'm having low hopes."
Among The Better Entries In MCU's Post-Endgame Saga,"The 28th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is the first entry in their Phase 4 slate of films that comes bearing a director's signature despite it following the standard Marvel formula. There is a slightly rejuvenating quality to it that has got more to do with the directorial craftsmanship on display than the scripted premise and when it taps into the madness, it is at least somewhat fun.

Directed by Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead & Spider-Man 2), the story takes a while to find its footing but once it does, the momentum isn't entirely lost as it dives into the darker elements and delivers a picture that's consistently amusing. Raimi directs the formulaic story with passion & finesse while also taking half measures on the horror & camp aspects and he hasn't had this much fun in a while coz whenever the execution is good, it's very good.

The overblown CGI continue to add nothing of substance as we find Strange traversing through multiple realities where meets several mystical allies & adversaries, both old & new. However, his own personal journey & growth isn't much appealing this time around. The show-stealer is Wanda Maximoff who embraces her Scarlet Witch persona to unleash havoc & horror with a gleeful ruthlessness that makes her scenes a fascinating & thrilling delight to watch.

Overall, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ranks amongst the bearable films in MCU's post-Endgame saga and also benefits from Raimi's direction who manages to get plenty of mileage out of the serviceable script. While the film plays by the studio rules for the most part, the seasoned filmmaker nonetheless makes sure that his style & trademarks are imprinted on the finished product to at least some extent if not all the way. In short, Marvel Studios' latest is worth checking out."
Just another amazing movie by Marvel - DC and MARVEL FAN,"I don't know why some of people didn't like the movie... It's an amazing movie. From all aspects. If you are aware of all aspects of Multiverse, Wanda Vision, What If and the buildup Marvel has done. You will simply Love this movie.

The golden rule: Marvel FAN, you LOVE the Movie. You're not Marvel Fan, you'll find 100000 excuses not to like the movie."
Huge money + No story,"VFX 9/10 STORY 1/10

If you're just going for Marvel's VFX then you are in for a treat but story didn't lived up to a Marvel's level. Expected much from doctor strange.

Would wait for reviews before watching any Marvel's film."
Sam Raimi is a Man Of The Match,"A taste of horror, madness, sure the story is amazing, full of surprise, its kind the beginning of avenger END GAME II in multiverse of Horror. One of the best Marvel movie."
Things just got out of hand,"As expected this films strong point is surely visuals, just like in the first one. Also the soundtrack was surprisingly good and Benedict Cumberbatch just fits the Dr. Strange role perfectly.

Apart from the visual effects they managed to put in some great horror elements and an emphasis on violence which work well in the multiverse setting.

But this movie feels somewhat disappointing, due to the endless possibilities by the Multiverse. Next to those possibilities their choices feel like a lot of potential has been wasted.

Overall the story feels a bit messy and chaotic. Subplots disappearing in thin air, important development left out and a lot of dialog feels forced and forgettable.

The pacing is slightly off, especially in the beginning, and some of the character development feels cliche and too abrupt.

The biggest question before seeing the movie was where to take the MCU next and it feels like we haven't gotten any closer to the answer. This all seems like a reason for concern.

In the highs and lows of the MCU this one definitely leans more towards a miss than a hit."
Dispointing for every marvel fans...,
The Messy Multiverse of Meh,"Was excited to see this one after enjoying WandaVision, but it seems like anything Wanda may have learned from that experience was flushed down the toilet along with her humanity and likeability. They reduced her to a cardboard vengeful woman cut out with a pretty flimsy motivation to see her kids again even if it means killing a lot of people. The Wanda from The Avengers and WandaVision wouldn't do this. Years of character dev wasted. Elizabeth Olsen still delivers a great performance even if her character is doing things very out of character in this story. They .just chalk it all up to her becoming ""The Scarlet Witch"". Lazy, lazy writing.

Cumberbatch back as Dr Strange seemed to be just going through the motions a lot of the time. The fun from his previous outings as this character was missing. And the hair dye and styling is so severe it's distracting in nearly every scene he is in. As are Chiwetel Ejiofor's braids. They seriously need to get a new hair stylist- it was laughably awful. Note to stylist - NO ones hair is THAT black lol!

I was not a fan of America Gomez as a character. She was like able ""enough"" and I'm sure Xochitl Gomez will do better as an actress when she gets more rewarding parts, but she's not given much to do here other than run, look worried, and be locked in a glass box or trapped on top of a stone alter for loooong stretches at a time while the movie and world goes on around her. We are never really given any reasons to care about this character other than repeatedly being told she's ""just a kid"". And being told how powerful she is over and over and over. She was a pretty boring character despite supposedly having amazing abilities which she finally learns to control a La some massive eye rolling ""Dorthy from The Wizard of Oz"" revelation from Dr Strange. Seriously- Newt in Aliens had maybe 3-4 lines, but we are given so many more reasons and situations to care about her as a young character than what is done here. Or when Luke finally uses the force to grab his lightsaber while fighting Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back. He finally was able to do it himself not having it all delivered to him on a silver platter via some ""you've always had the power to do it!"" ham-fisted dialog. It could have been a thrilling moment which would have made the entire journey worth it. Instead I was checking my watch.

Don't get the fanboy devotion for Raimi who seems to have peaked after Army of Darkness. Both his Spiderman films were a disappointing meh for me and maybe I'm holding a grudge bc I am such a huge Spiderjunkie. His latest foray into the Marvelverse was a pretty dull slog despite all the action, special FX, fan service and surprise cameos thrown up on screen. These should have been applause-worthy moments but end up being a bit ho-hum considering. And you seriously off Prof X just to wedge in some of that Raimi black humor? What a messy, messy waste."
Horrible!!,It's good but it is a degrade the first documents strange was better than this. About cameos Marvel played a safe game. I expected more but fine it was a nice movie with Sam raimi's horror flavour.
The Multiverse,"Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness (2022) was a trippy and creepy sequel to the movie Doctor Strange (2016). Having Sam Raimi direct this movie was a clever idea, because the horror elements in the movie would only make sense if he were directing.

Benedict Cumberbatch is great as Doctor Strange; throughout the movie you can get behind him and his problems that connect to the main plot. Elizabeth Olsen was excellent as Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff; you feel for what she is going through, and you understand why she is doing what she is doing.

I really liked the first appearance of Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez in this movie. I like how she struggles with her powers, and I love how she uses them to travel with Doctor Strange through the Multiverse, along with being able to relate with her.

The horror elements were creepy and disturbing, and they keep doing that throughout the movie, especially the 3rd act. There were brutal death scenes that shocked me, which made me like the movie more because it pushes the PG-13 rating and lets Sam Raimi do what he wants with it.

I loved the multiple universes they travel through, and I liked how they each had their own design with its different versions of the characters that we know. The cameos in the movie are awesome seeing and some of them are surprising to see.

In the movie there are connections to the WandaVision (2021-2021) show and references to Marvel's What If...? (2021-2021) animated show. I am not saying you must watch them to understand the movie, but I recommend watching them, so you understand certain scenes in the movie.

I had a lot of fun with this Doctor strange movie; it is one of the darker MCU films and I enjoyed every second of it. I think Marvel fans will like it too."
New Style of Marvel,"I really like this film even the content of the film is not as much as I thought. It focuses on characters rather than exploring the multiverse world. But with the direction of Sam Raimi, made the film special and very different from the previous Marvel films. The horror, JumpScare, and his directing style is so unique that makes this film very unique as well. Which makes me like it very much!"
Stupid and pointless,"If Wanda is this powerful why didn't she eliminate Thanos on her own? Please end this ""all mighty female bull....! It doesn't need to be in every movie and series by all means."
"Typical cliches, feels like it was hastily thrown together.",
How dare a mother want her children back,
Not what I expected,
Loved it.,This film was awesome. My son and I enjoyed very much. We watched in imax 3d. I highly recommend in 3 D was bass ass. There were some amazing happenings.
Disappointing plot,"What's even the point of making a movie like this where you keep asking yourself ""what am i looking at here""? It seems like this movie has nothing to do with Doctor Strange per se, what just a filler to keep you occupied."
Plot,
Not your typical Superhero movie,
Another good movie from MCU,
Disappointed,"A bunch of cheesy lines. The story was all over the place. Tons of plot holes and things that weren't explained or didn't make sense. The new characters were uninteresting and I had no reason to care about them. I heard that they wanted to make something a bit different and new (like a horror-style Marvel movie) and it just didn't work. The CGI wasn't even very good, which was surprising. This is definitely a huge step down for Marvel, especially after Spider-Man: No Way Home. It's like they put all their time and energy into that and other, bigger, projects and gave this movie no consideration. Hopefully future Marvel movies are better."
What Dreams May Come - meets Avengers Civil War - meets Alice in Wonderland - meets Carrie - meets ParaNorman - meets Everything Everywhere All At Once,"OVERALL.

Overall #DoctorStrangeInTheMultiverseOfMadness is What Dreams May Come - meets Avengers Civil War - meets Alice in Wonderland - meets Everything Everywhere All At Once - meets Carrie - meets ParaNorman

I found the film entertaining, but one thing I've said for a few years now (since Disney buying Marvel early on) is that the film felt like a Disney film. For some odd reason, Act 3 felt like the Marvel I would have wanted while Acts 1 and 2 came off as literal PG-13 fun...like Spy Kids... This isn't to say it's a bad thing, but it is something I think I'm personally going to have to make myself accept with this new Marvel.

Additionally, I do feel that an America Disney series should've been released prior to this film...maybe instead of dropping the Hawkeye or Falcon and Winter Soldier series...

SN: Stay for the first post credit, you don't need to watch the second.

OTHER THOUGHTS

Highlights: The visual effects and cinematography, the storyline for the Scarlett Witch, Act 3, thematic followthrough, pacing, and subtle LGBTQ+ representation.

What Could've Been Better: America's storyline/overall existence as a character was my main qualm with the film."
All a bit of a mess,
A perfect example of missed opportunities,
"Multiverse of Midness- if you know, you know",
"A wacky, weird and horrifying installment to the MCU that falls flat the more you think about it.","7.3

Doctor Strange 2 is director Sam Raimi's first movie in 9 years. It isn't that bad. The use of horror in an MCU movie is really well done, giving me jumpscares on every second. However, these fail to cover the mess and junk produced behind the scenes.

Firstly, the pacing is a very huge problem. 2 hours fly away like 30 minutes. Having good pacing is important. Films like Infinity War have used them to turn 140 minutes into 10. However, it seems like this movie uses pacing too effectively. When the movie ended, it felt like I had spent only a couple of minutes in the theater. I wish the film took it's time. I really wanted to appreciate the outstanding visuals and the grand scale of the multiverse.

Secondly, there are way too many concepts that aren't well executed or established at all. For example, the skeleton dudes from the trailer are barely establish beforehand or are executed. They just show up and then get easily beaten by Wanda. Each concept enters a cycle of just existing, being used, then discarded and quickly as possible to ""conserve runtime"" as if the movie wasn't short enough.

Thirdly, you need to watch WandaVision in order to understand the movie. I didn't have any difficulties since I had already watched most of the MCU TV Shows, but I noticed that some people did. I never fully realized how big of a problem it was. This movie is unforgiving to those who haven't watched WandaVision, and I didn't like it when I realized that many people had to do their homework and binge watch a TV show to enjoy a movie.

In conclusion, Doctor Strange 2 is one of those movies that promise everything, but deliver the bare minimum. At least this film delivered some more than the minimum."
Lukewarm movie,
A darker side of the MCU i was excited to see,"I have been waiting for this movie for a long long time. It did not disappoint.

The visuals are stunning, the story is extremely captivating and the cast did an amazing job.

There were a few scenes that made me think maybe Stephen King wrote them, and I enjoyed every bit of them. Something different that works and makes the story even more interesting. I recommend watching it and keeping an open mind."
The ones who get it... get it,"Not for the casuals, this is deep into the next phase of marvel and one needs to have watched virtually everything since infinity war to appreciate this."
Scarlet Witches film,
Absoulte visually stunning,"One of Marvels shocking and visual stunner of movie centry, with the orginal cast of #drstrange lot of suprises and really visual spectacular stunning visuals, if you like the first dr strange movie you will love the multiverse of madness, add in the absoulte horror like features of the scarlet witch (Elizabeth olsen) comebined with onscreen chemristy with Benedict comberbatches dr strange. This is one marvel movie you should warn your kids about, definitely a watcher and abouslty mind blowing film with a hint of aboulste horror.

Side note you must watch #WandaVision in order to make sense of this movie as Disney plus series ties into the #mcu

We rate 8/10 time stones

#SpoilerFreeReview #MarvelStudios."
Have You Ever Wondered What Kind Of Baby Marvel & Halloween Would Make?,
Not a Superhero movie but a logicless movie,
Trust betrayed,"I think Sam Raimi has no business directing a Marvel movie. Parents have a certain level of trust with the whole MCU, that they can take their kids to them without much worry. Trust betrayed."
Totally madness,Epic masterpiece superb wanda show dr strange show osm visuals.wong is incredible new character girl was lovely. Little cameos also good tottally superb film really enjoyed goosebumps momments so many.
Okay,"I am not sure what to say. It was entertaining, portions a bit silly. A lot of people laughing in portions that were meant to be serious. Not Marvel's best and was sad what they did with Wanda."
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness(2022) review,
I don't know there can be spoilers in my review ... Read it on ur own risk....i m not spoiling anything but some people can find it spoiling.,
Madness at its best,"I understand that after so many speculations people expected 'hundreds' of cameos... but let's be realistic - it wouldn't make much sense. That kind of let down is realistically understandable. Many people expected a show at the level of 'Endgame' or 'No Way Home' - let me tell you a little secret - it most probably won't happen for another 2-3 years.

Multiverse of Madness had everything we should've expected to see - and more!

All the cameos were so pleasing, CGI was on point - and obviously Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange were unmistakably amazing. But not so surprisingly, every single actor actually stood out by their amazing performance - especially Ms Gomez - perfect version of America Chavez.

And I'll repeat - just because this film had a lower overall score than Endgame or No Way Home, doesn't mean it's not good. It's actually amazing.

And it surprises you with different things than you expected, which makes everything even better.

Go and watch it, I warn you. You won't regret it!!!"
Complete Garbage,This had nothing to do with the first movie. If you watch this movie and forget everything that you enjoyed about the first movie you might be able to enjoy this. Total disappointment!!
Meh 6/10 ...!!!,"Meh this film is ok but im getting bored with the marvel franchise now , however i will still continue to watch them ;-) ......... ... ... ... ... ...... ..... ..... 6/10 .!!!!!"
A fun trip,What I enjoyed the most about the film is it's different from the other marvel films. It's scarier then most and more complex. I'm happy they made it different from the other films and made it darker. The visuals where amazing and acting.
A filler basically,I thought emo batman was bad until I watched this. Story is bland and dull. I was really looking forward for this movie and had high hopes. The only thing that was interesting is other characters in those other universes. I hope we can see our favorite heroes return.
what a waste of time for those that are above 6 years old.,"Over acting, dialogues that are trying to be funny but are embarrassing at best and a guy that all through the movie waves his hands like he has a stroke.

Bad, very bad movie."
Great potentional but failed to prove it...,
This movie was unbelieva,"This movie was unbelievable. In the good way. I swear, this is a top 3 Marvel movie and everyone else who says it isn't good doesn't appreciate it enough."
not what i expected,"I thought this would also be a good movie but it didn't turn out well according to my taste. This is my own opinion, I do not know about the rest of the people."
multiverse of midness,"It was mid. Not much else to say. It wasn't awful, and is pretty on par with the first Dr Strange film - here's to hoping that Thor Love and Thunder is better. I can't help but feel that most phase four Marvel films (this one in particular) relies on the audience watching past content (of which isn't just the previous films but series too) which in a way feels unfair and takes away what was so great about many of the past Marvel films - that being that anyone could go in blind - this idea also contributing to Marvel's success. Was it a disappointment? Yeah."
"Writing o' writing, where did you go?","Pressure plates on the sidewalk which randomly reveal memories, in lieu of dialogue and actions which bring it up. ""Intelligent"" characters doing the dumbest thing people with any inkling of common sense knows is not good, just so the plot can advance. There was no story here, just set pieces and ""payoffs"" to things that never came up, and thus it has no impact. The special effects for the most part were excellent. That's why I give it a 2. Otherwise it would be a zero, this type of garbage is insulting."
Trash...,The movie was so cringy. Especially America's fainting moment was soooooo hilarious. Probably they thought they can save the scenario with Charles Xavier lol.
Disappointed,"I wanted this to be better, I am a Marvel fan but this was lacking. It was an in between movie setting up others. After Marvel's history of such good storytelling this one failed for me. Hopefully the next generation of films can improve."
The Ultimate of Stephen Strange.,"It starts with a bang. There is no 'we should start it slowly' drama here. Acting is Super, there are very surprising appearances but the movie story is way better. Scarlet gives Strange all the challenges he can't dream of. They are fighting for a book more then the actual 'Universe Jumper' - You will get it when you watch it, and that's where it fades a little. I think the 'Universe Jumper' should have been given extra on screen time with a little more importance through out the story, then just in the end. But anyway it was a good watch."
Most Disappointing MCU Film to Date,
Ignore the haters and enjoy,"Great return for Sam Raimi, very enjoyable mix of Raimi's style and Marvel. Not the usual formulaic cheese you expect from Marvel. Great imaginative style throughout especially the dark elements that look like are straight out of soulsborne game. Much better than the last 2 marvel films for sure. Give it a go :)"
Great movie! Nothing feels out of place..(No spoiler review),"I don't see why people are bombarding this movie with negative reviews, this movie is really great! I wouldn't go as far to say that it is the best Marvel film, but it is definitely worth watching. If you're a true fan, it will leave you quite satisfied. The unique direction of Sam Raimi is 'clearly' noticeable, the horror elements are so much well done than a typical horror film, the Jumpscares, the beautiful visuals...amazing job! And, this movie doesn't hold back, it's dark, not much likely for an MCU film, but just what you'd expect from Sam Raimi. Nothing seems out of place, it just immediately starts, grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Also! The music is INCREDIBLE! The dissolve transitions, the random 'zoom-ins', are all you can expect from vintage Raimi."
Lacks Substance!,"If u're a hardcore mcu fan it won't matter to u, If u like lots of crazy cgi work still it won't matter to u.

But between all these if you want some substance in the story line that could make u feel like u have been In and Out of MCU in 2 hours just like previous marvel movies then I'm sorry its a huge disappointment 😞

Same old premise of ""I cant I cant then suddenly I can and I will"" type of superhero movie.

If you dont have any other options then only go for it pr else watch something better or just spend time with ur friends or family simple 🤷"
"Complete garbage; horrid story telling, awful dialogue, messy fx","My friends and I walked out on this movie near the end. The storyline about Dr. Strange was trivial; the storyline about Wanda was ruined by a lack of any true feeling (I mean, the attempt to make those kids seem loveable was, instead, laughable); the storyline about America (the character) was barely developed and got lost in the mess. (So much for trying to be diverse.) The use of special effects wasn't enjoyable (hey, look, another kaleidoscope!). Pitting the Wanda that lost her children against one that still had them would have been a compelling story about grief, regret, and love. Instead, we get ""phone it in"" cameos, cheap fan service, and lousy jokes with cliched dialogue. Somebody should be punished for making such drivel."
Multiverse of Sadness,"I've been waiting an entire year for this film and whilst it didn't disappoint exactly it also didn't excite me. There were some strong moments (Olsen, Cumberbatch and Gomez) we're definitely the highlights of the film. I wanted more and more of Wanda and her character but even she didn't live up to her full potential. I loved the horror element that Sam bought to the film and overall this was the darkest film in the MCU series (in my opinion). The ending of the film felt rushed and leaves a few questions unanswered (which clearly elude to there being more films). In conclusion whilst it wasn't the worst marvel film (thank you Morbius) it wasn't the best. I hope that we get to see more Wanda and I hope to god we get to see her uttering the three famous words she was destined to say 'NO MORE MUTANTS'."
Forced myself to finish it. Kinda wondering why...,"While this movie tries to explore human emotions, it seems to leave out simple human logic. Times when it should be showing some urgency on the part of protagonists seem to be slow-played simply to make room for more splashy effects. Don't get me wrong... The effects were all superb. Some of the dawdling should have been dispensed with, though."
"Gossamer thin plot, thick with sfx","The first superhero movie I actually slept in, despite the cacophony. Unnecessarily complicated, poor screenplay and hardly any plot. To think that cameos can enliven bilge like this is a huge mistake. Extremely disappointed, with the Dr. Stranges, as much as with Sam Raimi as a director."
"Love Sam movies, As suspected 10of10","One of best MCU movies. Is not the same as other marvel movies and thats why i loved this one.

Thank you Sam for amazing experience.

Please can we have now Spiderman 4.

Thanksna lot ihooe we gonna have more your movies."
Pleasantly Surprised,
dr.darkStrange,"The film was amazing, only the events changed early.

In the final episode of the film, it raises a lot of questions that I'm waiting for answers in the next Marvel movies."
A Marvel movie so different than the rest... while still the same as the rest.,"With the introduction of the Multiverse, this movie took full advantage of the opportunity to explore new worlds, new variations on familiar characters, and character cameos that Marvel fans have been desperately waiting for! I enjoyed Raimi's horror influences on the MCU. Unfortunately, the movie propelled itself from start to finish at breakneck speed, preventing the story from really taking advantage of the exciting cameos and roster of characters. The pace also jumped past true character motivations making the average audience confused and unsympathetic towards a formerly well-accepted hero now turned villain.

Overall : Pretty good but filled with missed opportunities."
How'd Disney get away with it?,"Genuinely curious as to how Disney got away with a PG-13 rating on this one - it's pretty violent and really feels more like a horror flick. On top of everything else, the plot was super lame and I found that really didn't care how it ended - I just wanted it to end. Marvel has been stumbling quite a bit as of late."
They ruined Wanda. And made WandaVison make so sense 😐,
Terrible Writing,"The movie is visually spectacular and has some beautiful scenes, however the writing was a major let down. The movie lacked the charm of the typical Marvel movies with it's humor, action, and thrill.instead, being dark and extremely silly is the theme for this movie which didn't go well at all."
A colourful mess,"This was all over the place, I'd recommend a few Psychedelics and just enjoy the light show. The movie itself was very uninspiring. Even having two Benedict's couldn't save it."
Elizabeth Olsen. Enough said.,This movie is amazing and everything you want it to be & more. Elizabeth Olsen delivers an amazing performance and so does Benedict Cumberbatch. Such a different direction for Marvel and a very refreshing one at that.
Quite well crafted actually.,"This movie is visually stunning especially compared to the average mcu flick. It has contrast,it has depth of field it has interesting angles. The score is also notable as we have Danny elfman on it. Sam Raimi was given a good amount of freedom to do what he wants and I'm here for it. The actors turn up and give great performances (well most of them). However everyone individually is doing their best to nake this film great except the screenwriters apparently. The movie isn't converned with making sense or following its own previously established rules. Some characters are poorly defined(America Chavez). All in all you have a poorly and lazily written script that drags the movie down a lot.

TL;DR Could have beengreat but poor script. Well crafted otherwise.

6/10."
An absolute home run hit by Sam Raimi.,Sam Raimi made a visually beautiful film. This is the most visually appealing marvel of all time. Doctor strange in the multiverse of madness is a must watch because I believe you should watch the film and judge it yourself rather than taking critics so seriously. I enjoyed this film from start till the end but the cameos we're mind blowing.
Worth It!,
Average at best,
Multiverse of madness with no multiverse,"This movie is really obviously and no horror movie but with some scary scenes for child's I hope we became so mutch other universe to see but nothing, the movie is playing in only two universes The real sam raimi didn't come out apart from the Finale is really nice."
Disappointing,
Literally the worst,"The writers tried to hard to push an agenda rather than coming up with a quality script, I had no idea where this movie came from or where it was going, and that cookies were cringe as well."
Disney TV,Perhaps this movie could have been a 6 episode tv show on Disney. It certainly didn't value in at a cost of 7 bucks matinee standard. Bonus...BC provides the right amount of eye candy for visual entertainment purposes.
More Thor 2 than Endgame...,"..very average, unusual miss really from marvel. I mean, it's fine, it doesn't really get going until the second hour , until then I was fairly bored.

The Illuminati bit is cool, yet somehow a wasted opportunity. Puts beyond any doubt that the scarlet with is the most powerful 'hero' in the MCU at the mo."
A dark heavy incongruent storytelling cul-de-sac that lasted over two hours and ultimately didn't add much of anything to the MCU,"No real spoilers, but I think going in with low expectations and understanding that Wanda has gone FULL VILLAIN will help you to enjoy the experience more. The Wanda you love from the Avengers, from WandaVision, flush her down the toilet she's gone psycho, and the ""reason"" they gave is unsatisfactory to me. You won't leave feeling uplifted, and I want that from a superhero movie personally, but it was epic, so if explosive visuals are why you're there you'll likely enjoy yourself, but just a heads up, Wanda is awful now, which I find jarring and depressing. Without being too specific, I think the movie was a missed opportunity in multiple ways, but it's a big epic feast for the eyes, not very kid friendly BTW, but I personally was on the edge of my seat in awe at everything happening, so you decide if/how/when to watch it, but I do not recommend with kids (darkest MCU chapter thus far for sure), and even though it was downright awesome at times, I'd probably rank it last among the MCU movies for me. I think lower expectations will make people enjoy it more. It's kind of amazing, but personally my least favorite. I guess the foremost problem I have is that they spent 5+ years building a character and disregarded her completely. I just feel like if they wanted to make the Scarlett Switch to villain, they could have done it in a way similar to WandaVision, where she is sort of selfish and abusive about getting what she wants in certain circumstances over certain issues with certain people, rendering her a complicated and interesting relatable character, without being a one-dimensional unrecognizable indiscriminately murderous PSYCHO. They did her such a disservice, it's like Raimi & Co. Didn't even watch WandaVision. Couldn't she just ask America to take her to a different dimension??? That's what the Wanda would have done that they previously introduced. I just don't vibe with the core premise and what they did to Wanda and how they ""resolved"" it in the end... terribly weak ending IMHO. Another curiously uncoordinated Phase 4 entry, and with one singular exciting end-credit-sequence, it did basically nothing to introduce a new overarching story, yet again, a surprising failure at universe building from the people who we all previously considered the infallible masterminds of that. Don't get me wrong, it is an amazing movie in a lot of ways, but simultaneously it nevertheless is a dark heavy incongruent storytelling cul-de-sac that lasted over two hours and ultimately didn't add much of anything to the MCU. If you go into the story with those low expectations you'll probably enjoy yourself."
Seriously WTF?,
"Great 3D Experience, Lack of Good Story Though",
Lacks direction in all possible ways,"I honestly don't have a good thing to say about this movie. Everything about it was misdirected and an absolute mess. A hot mess. It felt like the writers watched Rick & Morty once and thought ""we should do that"", but failed miserably.

I expected a lot from the actors - Elizabeth Olsen, especially - and got nothing. Poor performances and a poor script.

Most of all I'm disappointed at this version of Scarlet Witch as the villain. Such an interesting character, with so much build up and understanding, but by far the most bland villain since Thor 2."
"Madness indeed, but not in a good way","I think the core idea of this phase of the MCU is fundamentally flawed - that is ""the multiverse of madness"". Building good stories for this phase is next to impossible because the basic premise is so chaotic. So, it's not entirely surprising that the whole story line in Doctor Strange 2 is bad, but I didn't expect it to be this terrible.

I won't spoil anything but I will say that the plot hole in this one are more numerous than the jumps between alternate universes and bigger than Doctor Strange's ego. The actors generally do a good jobb and the directing is fine. I am disappointed that America Chavez as one of the lead characters is basically a MacGuffin that doesn't get any character development and even less relevance to the progression of the story (except for just existing).

The movie focuses on Wanda and Doctor Strange but their stories aren't good - in particular Wanda's that is a mess of contradictions.

The only reason to watch this is to follow the progression of the overall MCU plot, but I have a feeling that it's not going to be long before I'm past the point of caring about that."
WILD RIDE MADNESS GOOD!,"Saw it twice already (one on Real 3D, and the other on Imax), and boy oh boy it's as good as most Marvel movies up there. Both Benedict & Olson (what a duo!) did an amazing job here I would not be surprise if they are nominated for their work in this movie. There's a lot of technical new tricks (vfx cgi etc) here which are very refreshing. My personal favorites are the horror part of the movie (the sound of horror fight) and Wanda's struggles with Scarlet... Sam Raimi is the man!"
A solid good time,
The arc of Wanda has been destroyed by this movie,"Basically, this movie has nullified everything that previous movies have built for Wanda, particularly WandaVision. It's like the raved TV show never existed."
Ok movie but expected better.,
You really want to like it.,
Too many plot elements,
"Hectc, poorly done, predictable.","Although this movie is called ""multiverse of madness"" the writing was straight madness and directing as well. The moment I saw this in theaters I knew that Wanda/scarlet witch wasn't going to win. Due to the catastrophic result if she were to win. The entire multiverse would be enslaved. So quite frankly they needed a better plot or more engaging story. Like in the most recent batman film (2022) they did an excellent job at capturing fear and mystery. The story wasn't so catastrophic that we can't even comprehend. It's simple but yet ominous. Although the riddler lost, we were not ready at all for the flooding that he caused. It was such a twist and created interest. However doctor strange was just lazy and unentertaining, with corny lines and a corny story. As well as crazy unexplained items and characters in the story, if you are not familiar with the comics you will have practically no idea what's happening. There's a book of vishanti, a demonic eye with tentacles, a plain and boring character who can travel through the multiverse, and Scarlett witch who wants to absorb her power. And then there's dream walking, the dark hold, the Illuminati, fan service. AND ON TOP OF THAT, the multiverse strange and Chavez teleport to is just the most boring and plain layout they could ever do. For Christs sake we could have been in a paint multiverse, but no a multiverse where there's lot of wild life, ""free"" food and different colored lights. This entire film was poorly made and written, and will be just an average film. What marvel did EXCELLENT with infinity war is that the villain won! We actually saw a villain finally win in a movie and it shocked all of the audience. This movie was just sad."
lower your expectations,
4 letters: C.R.A.P.,"When are we going to stop with this non sense?? Watched it with my 12 and 13 daughters. It was so ridiculously stupid they, themselves, couldn't take it and started laughing at every line. 4 letters: C. R. A. P."
Very poor story,"To creat new heroes or bring the old ones just to be defeated by evil Wanda really absurd ,, America the teenagers really represent the great America nation who is now all gay people .

You ruin it for me i am a big fan of Avengers ,, Such a waste."
Incredible,One of the best marvel movies to date. Doctor strange never disappoints. Really enjoyed every moment of it. Excellent story of the multiverse. It was just too Epic.
Star Wipe,Power Point
Not worth the Hype,"Too much ""safe zone"" for MCU nowadays, they're just doing the same repetitive formula on each big movie. If you watch it only for the fan service, then maybe you'll say it's a good movie. But from the plot or even just the simple immersive experience it's far from average. Just watch the trailer, that's all you need to know where this movie will goes to."
Too Bizarre,"I typically like marvel types shows. I have since I was a kid. But I guess my geekdom isn't sufficient for all the Easter egg knowledge for this show. Which is less Easter egg, but plot points

And I hated wandavision for so many reasons. And oddly she wasn't the worst part of the movie. It her Thanos over the top ''nothing can affect me"" gets old super fast

I wish they had cut 30-49 minutes off the movie and trim all the distractions from a traditional marvel recipe

But my teenager really liked the movie. Which tells me, I wasn't even close to the audience the show aimed at. He is the only reason I stayed to watch the movie, because 'sunken cost' was not enough to keep me in my seat for this movie.

Which now makes me think that unless has a 8.5 rating or higher by thousands of viewers,...I'm thinking all future marvel and dc films will be if the same ilk.

Although I will watch the next Thor movie as it so far has not failed."
Classic Marvel film but...,
Not bad...but what's the point?,"Don't get me wrong, i gave it a 8. But i do not see the point of this film, and other marvel films, after the Endgame. Marvel needs to provide a clue to tie up all the films, like infinity stones.

I am still missing the part where Dr Strange becomes the best of them all. More multiverse madness, but here's the trend now. Watch it as an avid fan. Non fan should also watch too, since DC sucks anyway..."
Good but not amazing,"The base of the movie is weak. Mother wanna live with her childrens and all the fuss is over this thing only. The VFX and fighting scenes are good. The fighting duration could have been increased, emotional stuff is not too much which is good, comedy is not there at all that's a bit negative. The movie is not worth it's ticket price ( for me it is INR350)."
A Nice New Approach to Marvel Movies,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was a fantastic superhero film that I thought did a fantastic job of changing the theme of marvel movies a little bit. I appreciated the slight horror elements and the approach of more mature subjects, like the death of superheroes, and I thought the story overall worked well. I felt like Elizabeth Olsen's performance as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch was genuinely terrifying at times and even if her motivations were not super compelling, it still was believable based on how Olsen portrayed the character. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing a Marvel film that offers a fresh tone to the MCU."
Loved it,"The story was good, action was good, what not to love, it was amazing, hell of a ride.

Characters fit perfect, with all the milti verse theme now, i think tony stark aka robert downy jr can come in the upcoming movies, i am sure of it just like spidermans😂 Let's see what happens."
Sam Rami Ruined this Movie,
MCU Meets the Ring Meets the Walking Dead,"This movie sucks. From the opening scene right to the weak ending this is a bad movie. The only reason I have rated it it 4 stars instead of zero is because Benedict Cumberbatch is about the only one who manages to salvage anything from this poor script.

Where has Chavez suddenly come from?

She has zero acting ability and no chemistry what so ever.

She was injected in to the movie to tick boxes, nothing else.

The plot is a mess, the lines are absolutely cheesy and cringe.

This isn't a MCU movie. This is the ending of Wanda Vision turned into a movie with a bad script and some Sam Raimi horror thrown in as a gap filler.

MCU ended with End Game.

These movies are only made to tick boxes and for liberal pressure groups thats why they have zero plot."
Flawless,Awesome film and great cgi. Coupled with great cameos and that Sam Raimi grittiness as well. The story and the narrative worked amazingly well and delivered what I wanted.
Madness !!!,"Multiverse of Madness has exceeded. It's definitely a new level and area Marvel has explored. For me it was and is the most anticipated movie of the year. We had to wait 6 years for a new solo chapter for Dr. Strange. The wait was worth it !

The story is one hell of a ride. It felt like a rollercoaster ride. The events of Spider-Man No Way Home, WandaVision & Loki shows up with its consequences. Well balanced and paces with short breaks to develop a story which goes through like a.common theme. I also have to point out the fascinating camera work. I can recognize with ease Raimi's handwriting on that. Haven't seen Evil Dead, but found similarities in relation to the Spider-Man trilogy & Drag Me To Hell work by Sam Raimi.

Special Effects & Sound

Design & CGI were unbelievable good in detail. Specially when the camera moves for things like a lamp or a shutting door you proximately get those Horror vibes. Credits to Raimi he's a specialist for Horror elements and it shows !!

The soundtrack was a bit underwhelming. Maybe, I have to watch it on 4K IMAX at home with a much better Soundsystem than the cinema I went too. The positive aspect about the sound was it was off during scenes were you feel like it must be off. Basically you can say it was correctly inserted.

Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez

I had a good feeling about that character from the beginning. She is young and has massive potential for further movies or tv shows. Her ability is unique and suitable. While watching you'll understand what she's been missing and why it could become a really good opportunity to bring her back.

Xochitl did a great job. Her character cute and has trust issues. She definitely played her role convincing.

Elizabeth Olsen

My God, Elizabeth blew my mind away. She literally has the best and most badass lines in the movie. Her facial expressions, her look and fighting sequences were all impressive. I read people saying she stole the spotlight, but that's not true. We all knew her skills and her desire. Elizabeth plays her role convinced. She really loves her work and she also read comics. I love this kind of attitude.

Benedict Cumberbatch

Benedict Cumberbatch went through so many marvel movies and he still plays his role as Dr. Strange as if he's the perfect choice for the role. He hasn't lost his humor and charm. He embodied the arrogance & self confidence of Strange so good. That was another overwhelming performance. Top actor !

Sam Raimi

I was so happy when I heard he became the director of this movie. Sam Raimi was literally responsible for super hero movies to become famous. He deserves this spot for all the hard work he has done. He literally delivered a masterpiece of a movie. Thanks to his previous work experience with Kevin Feige the chemistry was there. Even though he was not writing the script he had his say and had a fantastic team with many script writers.

Movie is 10/10 don't listen to the bad writings they expect 100 cameos rather than good story telling. This is still a Doctor Strange movie. Read the comics and you'll find out why it can't be the way you wanted it to be haters."
Best Doctor Strange film yet!,"Sam Raimi was really in his element with this film. He pulled out all the Evil Dead stops for this film. He used his well seasoned experience to make an excellent sci-fi action horror.

This is especially good for fans of the Evil Dead series!

My only complaint is tthat I found the reasons behind the universe jumping young woman's flacid abilities pretty weak!

I look forward to the next one!"
Great but no chills,"I liked this movie, Elizabeth Olsen did really great but I didn't have any chills or goosebumps you know ? And where is Vision ? I get that she wants to be reunited with her boys but where is Vision in all of this ? He's supposed to be the love of her life and suddenly she's a single mom ? And Doctor Strange's character where not enough explored imo. But overall, it was a cool movie but not my favorite one and not on my top 10 I think."
Great musical score.,I loved the horror aspect of this film. Still a Marvel movie but with a bite and great music. I really enjoyed the ride through the multiverse. Benedict Cumberbatch and Benedict Wong have great chemistry and are fun to watch. A lot of surprises and scares along the way.
Does anyone else also thing that the Ilumanati were a joke in this Movie ??,"Does anyone else also thing that the Ilumanati were a joke in this Movie ??

Seriously , I am done with MCU movies now . After Avengers Endgame, this was my last movie to watch in MCU."
Just Painful,
"wow, what a horrible thing","This is a generic horror movie mixed with the Marvel formula, along with a horrible script; In several moments of the film, they do a horrible editing, you can't even take what's happening seriously; Totally meaningless character motivations and actions, you have to turn off common sense to swallow what is shown here.

The good point of the film would be the courage to deviate a little from the Marvel standard, but it's no use doing something different only worse.

Total waste of time, I don't recommend this experience to anyone, unless you like trash movie, then you might end up enjoying this one."
Horrible movie,
Propaganda much?,
Disappointing,
A bit too much madness,Honestly it doesn't feel like a marvel movie and the madness is way too much. They did a lot to include a lot of diversity and that was amazing but the movie it self and the plot is horrible. The ending and the tease is god awful I'm not looking forward to a 3rd movie.
Many characters is a clickbait,
Significant step down after no way home,It feels like studio rushed this movie.. there is so much more they could have done with this. Random character pop ups.. no real build up to climax. I found myself yawning during the movie.. couldn't wait for it to end.
Needed more layers,
I enjoyed it,
This film is complete masterpiece,"This is masterpiece & i don't understand why people criticizes it so much... sam raimi direction is outstanding, stunning visual effects, awesome action sequences & great acting by all involved actor involved... just do watch."
multi crap not multiverse,"Sick to the back teeth with marvel, the last 3 or 4 films have turned into utter crap, its beyond a joke now,just churning out boring rubbish time after time."
Poorly written,The movie was well made. The plot was lacking and just felt kinda lazy though. Characters weren't really developed like they needed to be for the plot to make sense.
Rollercoaster ride,"The firing of Scott Dirreckson really affected the movie to a degree. The script is solid but the plot seems kinda off. The movie should have been 15-20 minutes longer. This movie starts and does not stop. It doesn't have some breathing room. I loved the screenplay. Dialogues are very good, very very good. The cinematography is good but it could've benefitted with a darker colour palette. But all these negative is balanced with Raimi's direction. The music that Danny Elfman composed is phenomenal. But the USP of this movie is Elizabeth Olsen. She rules this movie."
Excellent!,"Tense, exciting, fun, innovative for the MCU! The movie manages to follow the Marvel formula and, at the same time, do something different! It's a mix of emotions. The cast is impeccable and the soundtrack is amazing! Join my favorites list!"
Dr Strange and the Multiverse of Diversity and Inclusion,"I love Marvel movies and the first Dr Strange was a good. However, this followup should be called Dr Strange and Multiverse of Diversity and Inclusion starring America Chavez. A. Chavez, this has to be the most ridiculous, funniest yet most awesome character name ever!"
somewhere out there there's a better version of this.,"Great visuals, good directing but lack the lapidation of a strong plot. Could have been the greatest film of Marvel so far, but it is just gets the job done. Nothing more or less.

As one said, somewhere out there there's a better version of this."
Finally Something Different,I believe the reason that I really enjoyed this movie is because it was not the same story we usually get from the MCU. What I really enjoyed the most was that it was not afraid to get a little darker. The score was something I also noticed because it seemed unique from other films that begin to eventually sound the same. It is just nice to get something that felt refreshing.
Average Film,One Word Review: Mediocre Film not that good as Spider-Man: Far From Home. Could have been better. Sam Raimi has been directed this film brilliantly but the Plot and the story is not as strong as it could have been. Elizabeth Olsen steals the spotlight. I think she did the great acting in the entire movie as compared to other characters and the Leading Actor Benedict Cumberbatch. This movie should be Scarlett Witch: In The Multiverse of Madness rather than being Doctor Strange.
It is hard to write a review for a Marvel Movie now,"As the title notes. In order to review a Marvel Movie you must 1st have to subtract out the standard buildings and cars being destroyed and other things flying through the air. I know these films are as good as printing money but watching this movie makes me think the whole film genre is getting stale. I mean how many fights can you have when they are just pushing some magical power against each other. Each time I see comic book movies now the bar slips lower and this is no different. Is it worth seeing , sure but the comic book films are now getting to the point where you need to start picking a choosing which ones you want to see. At some point they all just look like the same film."
WOKE zombie movie,"Ok Cmon, when are are going to get another real Marvel movie again? I am tired of the in your face Woke agenda in every movie. They INSERT it on purpose. Can they try to have it like the comics? I go to see Dr. Strange fight the enemy, not have some 14 year old chick fight another chick. Dumb. Watch the walking dead. At least you know you are watching zombies when you tune in."
Terrible acting. Terrible storyline. One of the worst movies I've seen.,It's the fact that they included a girl who fully resembled and reminded me of Dora the explorer with ZERO context of who she was... The storyline was dull. The acting was subpar. (My girls Rachel and Elizabeth were stellar) They had so much potential and opportunity with this movie and they really blew it.
Why this movie have a 7 ???,"This movie is superior. It show us a different variants of Strange, new incredible powers, especially with zombi variant. This movie deserve at least 8.5."
The worst MCU movie. Ruins the mcu,"This movie had a TERRIBLE script. It added nothing to the mcu. Mostly ruined any chance of future multiverse movies being interesting. The directing was absolutely terrible. ""It's Sam Raimi's style"" is a poor excuse to a dated, terribly edited, piece of trash with an absolutely awful score. The single redeeming quality to this movie is that Wanda's arch is actually what I wanted. But it was still completely terrible."
A pretty looking mess.,
Not enough Doctor Strange in Doctor Strange movie,"It is enjoyable if you like Sam Raimi style but even he couldn't help this movie with it's weak writing. The plot of movie is quite simple but it's execution is chaotic, pacing is way too fast and movie almost feels disposable. The movie should've been longer, There is not enough character development for Doctor Strange in his movie's sequel. The movie is more about Wanda than it is about Doctor strange. The acting and dialogue are inconsistent. Benedict Cumberbatch shows his acting skills but he doesn't have enough time to truly shine in his own movie. This is not the Doctor Strange sequel that Benedict or fans deserved and It's no where as good as the first Doctor Strange movie."
one time watch movie,
Multiverse of Disappointment,
Multiverse Schmultiverse,"For those who don't know, according to Marvel, there are many parallel universes out there. And guess what? There are many other Doctor Stranges (as well as Spidermen and on and on and on). But there are also differences. Maybe they sometimes have the same friends and other times they don't. On Universe 1 they have kids. Not so on Universe 2. Makes for a neat way for super-hero movie writers to tie up loose ends, but damn it is confusing to watch. This movie is a prime example.

Give me the good ol' days of one hero, one villain and one universe."
Very strange,"And also very original. Doctor Strange 2 is a movie like no other. That being said the whole plot and storyline were messy and sometimes this movie went over the top, but most of the time it was a solid sci-fi horror experience. Overall it was pretty good."
Terrible,"Terrible plot what we're they thinking with this movie, very boring stupid story line ... I have watched the marvels movies over & over but once was enough for this movie."
Another marvel formula,"I really enjoyed what if? Doctor strange episode that we got. I thought they are going to do crazy things in multiverse and we all know marvel is hyping up multiverse since loki but when i finally saw multiverse of madness today i was a lil bit disappointed.

Maybe it was cause of my expectations and hype marvel created for multiverse.

In this whole movie only one character work for me and that's wanda maximoff other than her no character was well fleshed out.

America chavez was big disappointment. I can see marvel is desperately trying to setup young avengers.

All the marvel fan boys are saying this movie is completely different than MCU. Lol. I have been hearing this line since shang chi. There are some horror elements there but story was nothing extraordinary.

What marvel do is try something little different with their each movie and fanboys just loses their mind.

Post credit scene is extremely worst and last thing i would say that this movie is completely forgettable trust me no one will talk about this movie after one month."
Poor poor Wanda,
A Multiverse of Disappointment,"There are too many aspects of this movie that are terrible, ridiculous, & overall poor filmography. From a cartoonish & terribly animated monster to the girl talking about her two mothers to scenes jumping from one to the next. Not to mention the drawn-out saga of Wanda, which was a blah blah plot. The movie could have been so much better - it seemed to have a ton of potential. But utterly disappointing."
Too little story,"I have enjoyed most MCU films, accepting their strong and weak points, but generally enjoying them. This one just doesn't get there - with too little story and relying too much on CGI effects. Although not an MCU film, the extremely weak sequel to Wonder Woman, WW1984, immediately came to mind."
"That, no doubt, exceeded my expectations!","Most of the people I know see that this movie is just continuing WandaVision events, but I see it not! I think this movie was made for pleasure and surprise, as it contains heroes who are not expected to see and events which blow the minds up! I can't write anything else to avoid spoiling in the movie.

All I want to say is I didn't expect to be surprised like that after getting disappointed by ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" particularly."
Marvel's biggest waste of potencial.,
The most an MCU movie can offer in 1 film,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet so you can stop reading this and go watch it. This movie has everything you would want in a super hero movie and more. And I would say it is a perfect idea of what a marvel movie can accomplish. I saw some bad reviews about the graphics and animation but these people seem to not understand what is going on here and the amount of graphic work is going into this thing. For every one thing that is noticed there is 100 things going on in the background that you don't notice. And that's the Beaty of special effects on a movie like this.

I would say the only draw back to this film is that there is a lot of build up from previews movies. It expects you to understand a lot and to have to have seen a lot of movies and shows before you see this movie. I got to see it in theaters and I noticed the people behind me kept saying ""who is that I don't know that character"" because they missed ""wandavision"" or never saw the x- men films. That would be the only thing to keep in mind while going in to see this.

10/10 from me and my wife on this one really phenomenal."
Disney fails once again,"Yet again Disney fails to create an actual movie, all in the name of wokeness. This really had potential, but ended up being a weak storyline and wasn't really about doctor strange. This was a Wanda movie with no direction that just happened to have doctor strange in it."
Worst Marvel film yet...,
"Good, but felt disjointed",
DOCTOR STRANGE very strange,A decent movie with breathtaking science-fiction scenes good acting I enjoyed watching it with my my wife and two kids.hope doctor strange will come back soon on the screen.
Disappointing,
THE WORST MOVIE IVE WATCHED IN MY LIFE,"This was such a waste of time. I regret wasting 1hr 55mins of my life and I also regret every single cent I spent on this monstrosity of a movie. I do not know where to begin from to explain this. The visuals were horrible and the script was ew. Whoever wrote it must have been on LSD or some sh. This guy mixed cartoons, zombies, ghosts, witches, Harry Potter, Mike Wazowski, guitar hero and many more. There were new characters and info introduced to the movie every 5 seconds which made no sense as they'd just come and go.

''Oh I am trapped in a cage. Lemme get this goblet out of my a$$ which can unlock the door"" Then boom goblets gone and we move onto the next item with magic powers. Not to mention that they all had all sorts of powers. Mf who do u think u r. Like we know for example superman had a specific range of powers but these guys do it all. The fly, they teleport, they create whatever weapon comes to their mind by moving their hands and the list goes on. It gets so boring after 5 mins cos whatever they have to face u know they will pull some trick out of their a$$ and sort sh out. ALLOW. Can I have my money back."
What in the world? Strange is an understatement!!,
"Crowded, in a bad way","The movie is crowded with universes and heros from individual universes. Very little time is given for building up the universes or its characters for the audience to build any empathy. Wanda's character seems bipolar, there is no other explanation to how she makes the most crucial decision at the climax.

Another movie with a ton of characters was Spiderman No Way Home. It was beautifully executed and you rooted for every character in it, both good and evil. Dr Strange somehow lacked that.

There are reviews saying this movie was dark, I do not agree. The fights were mostly magical disks and lights thrown around and some fell dead when it hit them. There are some exceptions, but nothing like DC's suicide squad or Peacemaker. I think Marvel could have done much better."
Wanda Vision series extended,
Expections were high,"As per the name, there was a little of multiverse but not enough. Illuminati was like kids there existance didn't matter. Wanda was lit, she was very powerful and did an amazing job whereas this film was more of a Wanda film than of doctor strange. Lastly, America chavez was good but she didn't do a good job so that's my review."
wow,
Pointless,
Blown away by this fantastic movie!,"It's more than I expected BRAVO!

Storyline with multilayer, acting just astonishing. There is taste of horror but well mixed with fantasy and action. From start till ending I was literally assimilated.

Must see absolutely!"
Families beware,"Disney / Marvel continue to push their assault on traditional family values. Intense scenes of demonic violwnce, witchcraft blood and gore with an extra measure social just preaching unnecessarily thrown in for good measure To boot, the story was bad and lent nothing to the overall Marvel franchise. Everything good is bad and everything bad is good. Watch out."
Fresh and Darker take for the MCU,"First off. Wow, do some people just not like anything off the Beaton path these days? This movie was such an breath of fresh air from the whole avengers style of cinema. I wanted so bad for New Mutants to be what this was. (Fox's last marvel film before the Disney buyout) Thank you Marvel for letting Rami do this film and giving the people more comic book content. These movies are exactly what true fans want in every way and allowing these directors to have their own creativity throughout the process is amazing. Please don't stop with this one."
Problems Of Movie...(SPOILER ALERT),
Doctor strange in the multiverse of madness,
Why made a movie ?,"Absolutely rubbish piece of work, no story and marvel factor. Please do not embarrass yourself my making movies like these. Folks avoid this movie, better watch it over OTT in few months.

MCU is not made to make a crap movie like this one."
Marvel movie for a DC fan !,"Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness breaks free from typical marvel superhero formula and take an interesting dark turn. I loved it. Its dark , gory and have a some horror elements . Its perfect in many ways. Ending should have been a little bit longer with more details. Other than that its THE marvel movie of the decade . I hope they will continue this formula on their future mcu movies."
More Candyfloss Entertainment - Another Fantastical Disappointment,"'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' is another candy floss entertainment assembled in sympathy with it's many, many other, sister stories, situated inside the Marvel Universe of heroes. Again, sadly, this MU genre is typified by violence; allegedly endorsed by heroic figures who primarily save and solve critical problems with violence. Essentially, MU movies lurch from one dire situation to another; whereby, superheroes solve and save the non-heroic general population from various critical problems - usually alien threats, seeking to extinguish mankind's existence. Thus, the viewer is entirely primed to assume, more or less, the ends justify the means, in terms of the heroes' conduct. Failure is a zero sum game, and the human race and Earth, are accordingly, situated as significant and important; such that, aliens or similar architypes feel compelled to invade or menace humanity accordingly. It is never considered that westernised, secular, individualist living, itself, remains at the heart of the majority of humanity's ills and degrading well being.

However, while, on the face of it, the multitude of MU heroic characters leads to an, apparently, endless flow of stories; productively similar themes result in similar responses and the resolutions. Violence is justified, because it is the means and mechanism for resolving dire threats. At the core of this universal space of heroism resides some rather inflated views of humanity, American culture, the human race, and where America fits within the scope of the rest of the world. Handily, one is meant to subscribe to the notion America stands for what is right and true; at least, the MU characters version of America, anyhow.

Thereby, we come to this movie, and its impact and texture, as a light entertainment event. Thematically, it is hard not to conclude the creators and writers of this form of drama see the symbolism of superheroes as significant and relevant to the our present times. In short, we (the westernized human race), have so many and so vast a spectrum of unresolvable problems we have to fantasize of fantastic solutions, as a sort of one stop shop, to solve the ills of humanity.

As to the question of whether this approach to contextualizing our lives actually has any value, or meaningful instruction; such consideration quickly become lost in a near continuous flow of action sequences - usually involving violence or visually complex activities. Arguably, then, this content should be promoted as content unsuitable for children; and yet, it's likely children are its primary consumers. Although, disconcertingly, also likely, many adults find such productions worthy of their attention. Unfortunately, however, I struggle to see how the MU industry offers any real value to the discussion concerning the human race, humanity's problems, or our innate weaknesses and self-generated ills.

Perhaps, I am just missing the point. MU, potentially, is all about displacing our daily concerns, letting go our worries and engrossing ourselves in someone else's crisis, one where we have no real vested interest. As to whether, in the face of the quickly multiplying list of global crises facing human beings, one should situate one's head in the sand, as astrategy, remains doubtful. Is denial a sensible response to a pressing need to face up to the consequences of how we live our lives? So, in summary, if you are still reading this opinion piece, this movie is yet another mindless American movie produced under industrially creative conditions to appeal to the least of our concerns or considerations. If this is your priority, likely you'll enjoy this movie."
More Disney Agenda,Bait and switch with cringe wokenesss. Sad. Visual effects are great but story and characters are paper thin. Hard to care about anyone in the film. You could literally remove every scene with Doctor Strange and the movie would be the same.
Could have been better,Great CHI graphics but the plot needs work and the characters could have been better imagined. All in all it's a pleasant way to relax and eat junk food.
Lot of madness without a story depth and injustice to Wanda's arc,
Good movie but not according to the movie title,
At least it was different than the usual MCU stuff.,
What a roller coaster! -Tyler S.O.,"-Tyler Stricker-Ogurian I enjoyed every minute of the film! Sam Raimi really delivered a gem, through his incredible eye for detail, camera work, cinematography, CGI, and the acting, the acting was great. I really hope to see a follow up in the hands of Raimi! Such an iconic director! Amazing job Marvel + Disney! Bravo!"
In the multiverse of badness,"It sucked. The cgi looked awful, the sets and costumes cheap as hell, the dialogue was composed of humorless quips and exposition which lazily relied on callbacks to stuff I don't remember. Doctor strange is boring and his friend America something is even more boring. Elizabeth Olsen was surprisingly bad in this. The last act was a love letter to Monkey Bone, which I appreciated."
Terrible movie stupid plot,"I actually enjoyed the first movie because it was sort of original, the reason that i never watched avengers or x man anymore is because they made lots of movies and i can't and don't want to remember which is which. I don't get it why they put different movie characters together in an ok brand? Why should they push the GAY trend in the worse manner (2mothers) in every new movie? After watching 40 minutes I had my answer: Lack of creativity. Lack of professionality. Horrible movie, Bad influence. Disgusting..."
#Awesome,Wow what a great movie! If you are true marvel you are never going to be dissapoint😀. As a true marvel fan i was eagerly waiting for thise movie and the movie was epic. I enjoyed every scene. And the zombi doctor strange(😁) was awesome.
Watching this felt like a big joke,"It was so disappointing.. Writing is terrible in this. It's like it's written by kids, although if it were written by kids it would probably be much better..

Writing is bad, toxic feminism is bad, cameos are OK, some things are cool, but not enough to redeem this train wreck of a movie. I sighed way too many times while watching this, when important things happened between certain characters I didn't feel a thing like the movie expected me to, I was just done.. Cgi is amazing in this, but it can only do so much. If the writing is terrible the whole movie is ruined IMO.

The characters strength gets dialed up and down for convenience and it's very frustrating in this movie as well."
Amazing,2 hour is not enough and I need more. I waited this movie for long time it's worth.you will more understand about wanda story. Don't miss watch this movie.
Keep the recycling for the trash,Nothing new and a weird blend of horror cliches. Multiverse is being used as a way to sell cheap concepts. Is marvel buying time to figure out a way to stay relevant?
Watchable for sure. Enjoyable too.,"It seems like Marvel is taking a turn.

Tough to tell whether its a good turn or not.

They are trying hands on horror genre. Like a good horror movie.

The cool graphics of the movie and Dr Strange himself made it a watchable movie."
The Darkest MCU Film by Far,"Amazing visuals, music and story. Sam Raimi really put his touch on this movie and it was very entertaining. I was surprised at how dark and violent this movie was, but it was a nice change of pace."
Perfection. Plain perfection in my pov,
Maybe 8.5-9,"I think there are a lot of mixed reviews because people expected too much after seeing Spider-man:No Way Home. This movie isn't heavy on cameos and I think that is why people are upset. Yes it is the Multiverse but I also expected a bit more cameos. However, this is definitely MADNESS. The visuals are stunning. There were certain scenes I couldn't believe how creative they were, and some scenes I jumped out of my seat because of how scary it was. Overall I enjoyed it. I think if you approach this movie thinking it is a Dr Strange movie with aspects of the Multiverse, and not Dr Strange and the whole extended MCU, you will like it."
Great movie.,Great movie all together. Will advise everyone to spend a few bucks more and go to Imax near you and watch it. Honestly it's way too good and the storyline is even better. Marvel really steped up their game and the CGI was just breath taking. This is a horror-superhero movie and I really liked this new genre. Sam Raimi is a gem and he should continue making marvel movies.
Was this a supposed to be a parody film?,"For a movie I have been wanting for years and for two superheroes who have always been my favorite (Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange), this movie seems like a joke. There were some very good parts where a more serious tone was shown but the rest of the movie felt like a complete parody of previous Marvel movies. From the laughable stupidity of the death scene to the absolute mess of a storyline with no real direction, with a sense that the writers just made things up as they went along. For such a serious threat - being the destruction of the multiple universes/realities, there was simply no urgency or seriousness. Each fight scene was mediocre at best, with usually powerful characters simply being KO'd after being tossed across the room.

With so much potential from the trailers and all the character development both from Wanda and Doctor Strange, what went wrong?"
"Zombie, Witches, Captain Marvel, Fantastic 4 & X-Men!!",
It's pretty good I suppose,"I like Doctor Strange and I used to enjoy Sam Raimi back in the day (Evil Dead II). This movie is certainly more on that end of the Sam Raimi spectrum. Less Spiderman and more Drag Me to Hell. Definitely more of a soft horror movie than the trailers suggested. And that's not bad but I'm not sure it's a good thing either. Dr. Strange as a movie character seemed to draw more fans in that wanted a more serious dignified kinda superhero. Well kiss that goodbye pretty early on. This movie is fun, not terribly gory, but it's more of a Ragnarok gear change i.e. If you like the first Dr. Strange you could still very well dislike this movie. A big heavy on the jump scares. I'm all for film homages but I don't think anyone from my generation terribly missed the bad stop motion animation. Campy, messy rather than bloody as a rating workaround (pretty sure robot guards were mainly there so character would need covered in oil rather than blood.

It was good overall but unexpected and the plot's fairly vacant (I'm going to be bad cuz well I wanna and everything sucks anyway so gimme). I don't want to hate on it but it sticks out among all the other MCU movies, including Dr. Strange and the other appearances of the character. Basically this answers the unasked question of ""What would happen if Dr. Strange shopped smart and shopped S-Mart?"" Alas no chainsaw hand but all the other boxes are checked. And Bruce's cameo was kinda lame (if you need a last name I'm ashamed of you).

It's Dr. Strange with a Sam Raimi remix: the Cumberbatch is in attendance but otherwise not a whole lot of similarity to the original. I guess it could've been better with less. Maybe I'd be happier if I'd seen it at home. By going retro it felt sorta cheap. Which is how most 80's films with special fx felt but that's why we make them better now. The spirit of that movies is absent but all the camp and technical limitations have been lovingly restored for your possible displeasure. Could've been better.

And P. S. you really don't need to rewatch WandaVision ahead of time. All you need to know is that she misses her kids, that don't really exist anyway (Multiverse blah blargle) and star Scarlet Witch rebrand/tiara. Still bummed about Vision. Enough to drop all semblance of morality from all her previous MCU appearances as well. It's just meh at best."
"Not what I expected, but it was fun, fast & furious!",
Don't usually write reviews but had to come in this movie defense,"I'm sorry it's not another marvel movie than every 10 year old kid appreciates. There will be some aspects that only grown ups will understand and who doesn't understand will complain about. Careful, it has some aspects of an horror movie."
Much better the 2nd time,"Saw this at the cinema and thought it was a bit confused and overwhelming. I was thinking maybe a 5 or 6 out of 10.

Just watched it again on streaming and it was much better. The action scenes are great (especially the one featuring the Illuminati!), and I appreciated the Sam Raimi touch a lot more."
continuation,"Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) tries to suck out the powers of America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) before she gets taken by a demon. It would have killed her but he fails and is killed himself. She jumps to the prime universe where the prime Strange tries to protect America. He approaches Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) for help but it turns out that she's the one coming after the young girl.

This feels like a continuation. One must watch the TV show WandaVision before watching this. More will be coming. With all the Marvel TV, this feels like an episode, just a very epic episode. It's setting up for more to come. I do like the sarcastic humor of Strange. The alternate universe is a good way to introduce new characters and bring back old favorites. Wanda is a scary villain. This is all good but the Marvel universe feels like it's at the setting up stage."
Great ideas just not applied well,
"A unique and exciting Marvel experience, spearheaded by the incomparable Elizabeth Olsen","Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a perfect edition to Phase 4 in that it breaks the boundaries of what we have come to expect from the MCU. It's story and the manner in which it was brought to life differs from all the movies prior to it creating what is essentially a unique experience for its viewers. There is no doubt that this movie benefits from its horror-esque design because these factors make the movie stand out as one of the most interesting and complex stories told in the MCU thus far.

MoM lives up to its title in more ways than one - it is complete chaos and madness - which, for the most part, comes to the benefit of the movie. The primary issue, however, is the length - with 2 hours being far too little time to fully embrace the mystics of the Multiverse, resulting in some pacing issues with some scenes moving too slowly or too fast relative to the story being told.

Aside from that, MoM succeeds in bringing together aspects of the Multiverse which embraces its complexity rather than shying away from what is essentially a monster of a concept. The greatest strength of MoM stems from the incredible team behind the film, from the creators of the musical score, to the director, and most importantly to its actresses and actors. As usual, Benedict did an exeptional job in his portrayal of Doctor Strange, whilst Xochitl Gomez made quite the impact in her acting debut as America Chavez. However, in spite of these great performances, and in spite of the title of this movie, the true star of the show was without any doubt Elizabeth Olsen.

Now in many ways, one could call me biased due to my love for the character and Elizabeth's portrayal thereof. However, in the case of MoM there is absolutely no denying that Elizabeth stole the show. Elizabeth's portrayal of Wanda/The Scarlet Witch in this movie is nothing short of phenomenal - the emotional depth that she created for this character was enough to feel drawn into the story each time her character was on screen. Elizabeth Olsen has always shown that she is an incredible actress and has shown her range in prior roles, but MoM introduces us to a version of Elizabeth which shows she is and always will be a force to be reckoned with."
Marvel special,"Its nit a doctor strange movie,its wanda movie..Wanda just awsm in this movie..she is not only beautiful,also a mother,lover and most powerful avenger."
Another Post-Endgame Low for Marvel,"Just when you think The Eternals is bad (reminiscent of some Bollywood Specials...), No Way Home is worse (remix of a few old Spiderman movies and characters)... and this Dr. Strange is just a new low for Marvel... should have made this an episode of WandaVision instead."
Multiverse of Disappointment,Sam Raimi's return to the superhero genre is a mixed bag. Multiverse of Madness starts strong but ultimately falls under its own spell in a rushed and undeveloped second half. Fans clambering for a horror MCU film or a huge amount of variant cameos will surely be disappointed.
Cheesy as hell,Quite a bit of cringey lines and scenes. Doctor Strange movies used to be well made. Now they just throw in jump scares and cheesy lines. Random characters from other movies was kinda weird. It's all over the place now with these Marvel movies.
Not the best in this multiverse,Visually it was exceptional as ever. The jokes though are becoming a bit predictable need something new. The plot was interesting but seem a bit convulated with too many things happening. Overall it was satisfying. 8 stars for being good -2 stars for being woke. Guess America Chavez is going to join the USA military.
Not worth your time or money,The movie was a mess. It was exhausting to watch and not a fan of Disney continuing to push their alphabet community agenda either. If this is what phase four looks like then count me out.
I watched this movie on accident & the MCU Fanboys are Fools,"I wasn't going to watch this movie, but due to a ticket purchasing hiccup I went to see it with my 3 Sons & my Wife. None of us had anything more than mild interest in this.

Everyone involved thought this is among the best Marvel Movie ever. Ignore the fanboys."
5he Movie was Incredible and Unique,"I loveed the character arc and performances of each characters....the visuals horror elements everything was fabulous!!

Especially the fact that the movie is so unique and entertaining I found the performance of Elizabeth olsen extraordinary and emotionally satisfied I am very sure that this movie was the best movie after Avengers endgame from the Marvel and it leads the MCU into a much Hugeer plot."
Zombie Strange and the evil dead. Really bad. Gosh.,"Been a Marvel movie fan for a decade. The original Doctor Strange was one of the best but this sequel is just madly disappointing. Just finished watching the movie and still trying to gather my thoughts about it. Why do you need a Amen-lika to jump around different universe?? The feeling is certainly awful. The movie is confusing and boring at times, full of unnecessary details and scenes that were totally off. Too much CGI and green screen. Felt like going to an animated art show than watching a movie. Director was trying too hard to create a dilemma, which really doesn't exist. No bonding whatsoever. Honestly I dozed off twice and had to move around my seat just to focus. The story keeps looping and it goes nowhere. Sorry but not an enjoyable night."
Fantastic,
A messy show with obligatory Woke garbage.,"This show suffers badly from having no internal laws/rules to follow. In every fantasy world, be it Middle Earth or Marvel's multiverse, the creators must have a framework of laws to keep everything consistent. The fantasy author Brandon Sanderson, creator of Cosmere, has discussed this idea at great length. Without natural laws that have to be followed, the fake world becomes a mess of inconsistencies and loses all reason. Multiverse of Madness suffers badly from this. Oh, and of course they just had to add in a small touch of Woke (a euphemism for Marxism) preachiness."
A great 2nd outing,"A great second film for Doctor strange, some jaw dropping moments and fantastic continuation from wandavision. A must see for any marvel fan. Looking forward to what doctor strange gets up to next. Emotional, funny and exciting from start to finish."
Not the greatest superhero movies.,"I can't say this was my favorite of superhero movies. I did enjoy the first Doctor Strange but with this one I had some problems, like trying to stay awake even though there is plenty of action. The plot was just not that great. Some CGI's were really good, and some others were mediocre, looked like a videogame sometimes, or just had way too bright colors to make it slightly believable. Way too many characters also, you can't handle that much susperhero characters in one story, it just becomes a bit boring after awhile. Plus I've never been a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch. To me he absolutely doesn't fit the profile to play a superhero, plus I find him boring. I'll never become a Cumberbitch and I wonder what people see in him that is so fantastic. That said, I watched the movie, like I do with all other Marvel and/or DC Comics movies but this one wasn't that great. I won't be watching it again in the future."
Its amazing,I enjoyed it alot its like horror but they hype did kinda ruin it because it was thought there would be more cameos from like deadpool or ghostrider or spiderman soo yeah.
why make wanda horrible,
Wanda the witch and her kids,"The ending was so childish and cringe.

Idk what would have happened if sam raimi didn't direct this movie, 3 to 4 scenes were good and some visuals but overall the storyline was a mess and the cameos were a waste. Run time was so less, and then they say batman was illogical."
In a word.... UNDERWHELMING,"Ratings of 1 are just as stupid as ratings of 10 in many cases. The same applies here. In my opinion this movies would rank in the 20's as far as MCU films.

NO SPECIAL MOMENTS NO REAL SURPRISES No rewatch value.

End credits scenes are DUDS

6/10 for a spoiler free review."
terrific fun,"In this movie, Doctor Strange meets a multiverse traveler and finds himself jumping from world to world looking for more Doctor Stranges to help him beat the Scarlet Witch, whose agenda is a carryover from the brilliant TV series Wanda vision.

It's mainly just an excuse for a lot of jokes and big action scenes but it's got a surprising amount of good character work, especially from Elizabeth Olsen, who is once again terrific as the deeply disturbed and insanely powerful Wanda.

Lots of fun, highly recommended."
I don't get the hate for this movie,"Genuinely one of the best marvel movies to date, very artsy, gory and has a pretty cool horror theme which we have never seen before in a marvel/superhero movie. Wanda does have a large part of the movie but idk, I like it this way, definitely got me more interested in her character now.

Watching Wandavision is not a requirement, I enjoyed it without having watched it and now I am going to start watching it because of the movie.

I love Sam Raimi and his movies, I think the hate just comes from the people that still think the Sam Raimi Spiderman movies are bad, which is objectively false.

People praise Black Panther even though it had cheesy writing but apparently marvel fans just hate it.

The hate is unfounded and this movie is deeply underappreciated for what it's done with a franchise that was starting to stagnate after Endgame."
Watch it only for Olsen if you must ... The rest is pretty forgettable,The new trend of blaming everything on the multiverse in the recent lot of MCU films is a mad phenomenon that was pretty okay in Spiderman: No Way Home but goes from okay to plainly underwhelming in the sequel to Doctor Strange. There seemed to be no solid screenplay and the dialogues were mostly amateurish. Gimmicks and catering to fan theories and nostalgia is proving to be the franchise's bane. The only factor worth the time and attention is Wanda Maximoff. Olsen pulls the character's many shades with elan and rises high above the mundane affairs surrounding her.
Doctor strange,
Wanda and the Multiverse of Midness,"Wow, I was disappointed by this movie even with the very little expectations I had going into it. The storyline was okay at best, the villain was quite underwhelming (even with the horror elements). The horror wasn't all that great in my opinion, I only really jumped at one little scare but that was about it, similar situation with the comedy, the comedy was quite hit or miss for me.

Much like a lot of other Marvel movies it has it's shining moments, (one in particular but I won't get into that). The special effects weren't the best at times but I also have to say there were a lot of good stuff, most of which was in the trailers but even still.

Over all, it was an okay movie, it really didn't live up to the hype at all. I personally wouldn't recommend seeing the movie but in the end if you enjoyed the movie, you do you man. If I were going to spoiler territory I would give the movie a 3/10 and not a 4/10 but that's more due to personal taste than anything."
The 1st horror movie for the MCU,I love Marvel but if I'm being totally honest I'm not the biggest doctor strange fan That's Said I can honestly tell you that this movieWas awesome and wonderful And is The Is Horror movie for Marvel I do highly recommend this movie Because It is More of a sequel To no way home and one Wanda Vision This changesThe Marvel cinematic universe forever.
Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Convenience,
SAM RAIMI HORROR!,"This film deserves all the praise it's going to get, it's non stop action for 2 hours it was a very fast paced film. With brilliant acting performances all round, gorgeous CGI as always with Marvel & brilliant action pieces. This film also had a brilliant horror tone through out & added a nice change to the normal ""Marvel sort of film"". The Original Score was also remarkable. It's another brilliant instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
MCU meet the world of Raimi,"The best MCU movie of late, recent movies like Shang Chi, The Eternals and Black Widow were average at best.

This movie for me is 100% a Sam Raimi movie without the craziness that makes his other movies A rated.

I loved the way he kept the multiverse simple, all these reviewers complaining that the movie does not concentrate on the multiverse would be complaining if he had made the multiverse over complicated.

Sam did an excellent job keeping the multiverse simple whilst getting the key concepts across to the viewers. Plenty of homage to the evil dead movies, especially evil dead 2.

Worth watching."
BEST MOVIE EVERR! 11/10 ❤👍🏾,
I watched this...,
Multiverse of Madness Review,"Doctor Strange travels the Multiverse while defending a new ally from a familiar evil.

This is easily marvels most ambitious project, and that is what makes it so interesting. I am through and through a horror fan, so it was great to see marvel finally stepping out of their comfort zone and trying something new. In my opinion the horror elements of this film were not scary, but they were done well. As someone who loves horror the toned down version that they did isn't scary to me, but two friends that I saw the film with are not horror fans so to them it was scary. This is of course thanks to Sam Raimis amazing direction, he came into this film late but was able to create an immersive experience and add in his horror talent, which create a fun film.

Elizabeth Olsen is phenomenal as Scarlett Witch. This is easily her best performance and I highly suggest you watch WandaVision before this.

Benedict Cumberbatch also gives his best Doctor Strange performance to date. I've been wanting more Strange for a while and what they gave us in ""No Way Home"" just wasn't enough for me, but this filled the want very nicely.

The new character America Chavez played by Xochitl Gomez was cool. She was interesting and Gomez gave a solid performance.

Now gripe time. First and foremost this movie is very rushed, and it is very easy to tell that they had cut some things that I think should have been left in there. The first 35-40 minutes felt like I watched a full movie, they went very quickly through the setup and it didn't work that well. My second gripe contains a spoiler, so all I will say is something happens at the end that is very corny. Lastly some of the CGI was rough, not a lot of it but there were a couple of noticeable moments that weren't done well.

Overall I throughly enjoyed this film, it gave us some fun multiverse moments mixed with the incredible Sam Raimi direction.

7.5/10."
"Hour in, was hoping villain would destroy multiverse to put me out of misery","We'll start with the good. The CGI action scenes are visually impressive. And there are many. So many, in fact, and with such little space between them, that they consume the story, with no time for the characters to do anything but ride the roller coaster. Also, it was nice to cram in a few seconds of cool characters we haven't seen in the MCU. I mean, it would have been cooler if they'd mattered more. In fact, they could have taken those characters and made a whole other movie better than this one, but we'll leave it at that.

Now to unpack the problems. Chief among them, the titular character doesn't make a single story-driving decision until an hour and a half in, and then it's debatable whether that even counts. There's literally a scene where presented a lock made by another DS with a watch-shaped hole in the center, he needs Christine to tell him how to open it. He's a dog chasing his tail! The theme of his god complex interfering with his personal life and being counterproductive to his goals is brought up. Yet his progress in that regard is so minimal that he may as well have been replaced by a hologram of himself.

The female characters shoehorned to the forefront of Doctor Strange's sequel, unfortunately, went the Captain Marvel route of strength over depth. A complete lack of nuance. Supposedly smart characters make painfully stupid decisions. They try to pass off sob backstories as development when how they react to situations tells us nothing special. But boy do they get screen time to showcase how power and awesomeness! Even the cameos, even when it doesn't make sense. As for themes, filmmakers figured the motif of 'you just need to believe in yourself to unlock your hidden power, girl' still counts as original. Makes sense - it fell so flat with Captain Marvel that no one will remember. Include LGBT relationship, check! But should it even count when it's utterly inconsequential? Meh.

I would love to see the same premise fleshed out with some decent writing, and appropriately titled Wanda vs Strange, split into at least two films.

Wanda could have been finding more plausible ways to relive her fantasy (sorry, but there is no universe where kids are that nauseatingly perfect). It would start rather innocently then quickly spiral out of control as she succumbed to the temptation to abuse her power more and more. We could see regression and struggle so that her story carries emotional weight. From the very beginning, Doctor Strange would have pushed the what's-her-name dimensional portal girl (that forgettable) into accepting the responsibility of learning to control her power. As she tries, she's crippled by painful memories, and shuts down. Frustrated, Dr. Strange is tempted to take matters into his own hands... In this Wanda and Strange, we have two sides of the same coin, one loving but selfish, another detached but selfless. Between them, a girl who more than anything needs a wise mentor, but is afraid of confrontation and struggles to discern healthy relationship from abuse - when to accept correction, assert herself or run. Being uniquely qualified to run, she is the only one who can allow others to help her.

Man that would be a cool film."
Raimi brings some horror and style to the MCU in this entertaining yet flawed entry,"""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" may not have been exactly what I was expecting, but it's a movie that I liked a lot and has grown on me the more I think about it! While I think it's a small step below the original, it's a great and most importantly entertaining film! However, while there is so much I really did love about the movie it isn't perfect, nor is it the home run for Marvel that I hoped it would be. That being said, it really is a fantastic Strange and Wanda story with some fun multiverse action! I was enthralled and entertained throughout the entire runtime, and I love the touches of horror that we got! There's so much to unpack here, so many things I liked and some that I didn't, which makes this movie a whole lot to process - in a good way!

One of my absolute favourite parts of this movie is Wanda, the Scarlet Witch. I have wanted to see her go full evil for awhile, and let me just say this movie delivered on that! It continues her emotional arc from WandaVision perfectly in my opinion, and adapted stories from the comics in really interesting ways. While I loved how villainous and terrifying she could be, I liked that there was a tragic side to this, seeing how utterly destroyed by her emotions she had become, and this made it easy to sympathize with her. Her emotional arc in the MCU is one of my favourite and I can't wait to see where it goes next! Her powers were also such a thrill, she was very overpowered, but it made it all the more fun (especially in a certain scene near the midpoint of the film). I will admit there were a few missed opportunities and it didn't perfectly line up with her development in ""WandaVision"", but I was so happy we got to see this version of Wanda. It also worked so well because of Elizabeth Olsen's stunning performance- she truly stole the show. As much as I loved Benedict Cumberbatch coming back as Strange (and he was fantastic too- so good I don't even need to talk about it because it should be expected), Elizabeth Olsen really poured her soul into this performance just as she did in ""WandaVision"". Much like Oscar Isaac's performance in ""Moon Knight"", Olsen's performance here has become one of my personal favourites in all of the MCU.

Now, that brings me to one of my issues. As much as I loved Wanda here, it really took away from the movie feeling like a Doctor Strange focused film, as he only had half the screen time and had to share with Wanda. While I loved this pairing, I wish this was a standalone ""Multiverse of Madness"" film instead of a sequel in Strange's trilogy. I say this because the writing clearly focused more on Wanda over Strange, her character arc was way more polished, contrasted with Strange's which was seemingly nonexistent, and forgot some of his development from ""Infinity War""/""Endgame"". It continued his story nicely and was fun, but it just didn't feel like it was as much of a ""Doctor Strange"" film as it should have been. The introduction to America Chavez was also quite nice, I love the character, but unfortunately she was used as a human plot device (but they did a decent job of it), and took important screen time away from Strange and Wanda.

The writing here is easily the biggest issue I have with the film, which surprises me as the screenplay was penned by Michael Waldron who wrote ""Loki"", one of my favourite of the MCU shows. He did a fine job here, but the script is simply flawed. While it set up the lore and rules of the multiverse pretty well, it felt rushed and had very awkward pacing and dialogue. It wasn't the tightest script at all, could've easily used another draft, and even seemed shallow at times, with some pretty lacklustre character drama. The movie also felt like it was missing something; and that something was heart. It just didn't have a soul to it, and barely had any emotional value, it merely showed the story and that was that. Sure it was fun, but it lacked the impact that films like ""Infinity War"" really had. The first act was very clunky and it wasn't until about 30 minutes in that the movie really found its groove. The story was actually pretty simple when you boil it down, and didn't have as much to it as I would have liked it to. There were definitely some big missed opportunities, but on the flip side I loved how the script really embraced the weirdness of the Doctor Strange comics and brought in a lot of cool elements we haven't seen before. I also liked the contrast between Strange and Wanda, Wanda focusing on emotion over logic, while Strange has extreme emotional detachment and relies on logic alone, I just wish the movie focused on this more. The film did feel disjointed at times too, and honestly it didn't always work, but when it did, it was truly awesome. As much as I bashed a lot of Michael Waldron's work here, I still think he did a good job and thoroughly enjoyed everything his screenplay had to offer, it just had a few flaws. I would definitely love to see him do more with Marvel as long as he continues growing as a writer. (And I love that he got a cameo!)

This film felt very different from the rest of Marvel, as much as I love the ""Marvel formula"" I love it when they try something new even if it doesn't work perfectly. This movie started off feeling pretty generic, and slowly became more and more Sam Raimi's film in the back half. Sam Raimi is easily this film's greatest strength, and I loved the breath of fresh air his style brought to the MCU. I was really surprised to see we got more of the ""Evil Dead"" and ""Drag Me to Hell"" Raimi over the ""Spider-Man"" Raimi, but getting those moments of horror sprinkled throughout was really fun! It's very distinctly a Raimi film, he nailed it with the style and horror, and really pushed the boundaries of what you can show in a PG movie! It was great, I had so much fun with the horror elements, this is the closest we'll ever get to an MCU horror film. The movie is quite bloody and brutal at times, had a lot of gore and even some jump scares! I couldn't get enough of it! It had Raimi's campy, creepy and especially groovy DNA all over it! There were some scenes that felt out of place or a little weird, but I liked the creativity of it. I also felt there were times (especially with Illuminati) where directors like the Russo brothers may have handled the action and large set pieces a little better, as a lot of the action scenes felt like they were over before they even began. But for the horror stuff alone, I'm so glad Raimi got to direct this, it had some truly horrific moments! I even loved the nod to ""Evil Dead 2"" with the Bruce Campbell cameo!

This movie works so well despite its flaws because of Raimi's style. He radiates energy and enthusiasm as ever, truly saving this movie from itself and building it into something so unique and distinct. His instantly recognizable touch is present through and through, even surpassing the usual limitations of the MCU. From snap zooms to circle wipes to shaky cam in first person POV, he pulls out all the old tricks while fully realizing the untapped potential of Doctor Strange to further expand his visual arsenal. The visuals here are fantastic! I even loved how on top of his usual stylistic choices, he added in some canted angles and dolly shots that felt right out of a horror film! His aesthetic choices were very Raimi-esque and I liked the look of the film a lot, and on top of his circle wipes I also loved the way he used match cuts in sequences cutting between universes. The CGI was fantastic and this is one of the only movies since the last ""Doctor Strange"" that I genuinely think used 3D well! My only issue was that it did lack some of the trippy, Escher-like visuals from the first film, it wasn't as visually interesting in that sense.

One of my other issues was with Danny Elfman's score. I am a sucker for good musical continuity- something this film barely had. Elfman completely threw out Michael Giacchino's themes for the character which have been used in the MCU numerous times since the first film, and this really upset me. I miss the harpsichord based instrumentation, and while we got a few seconds of the Strange theme here and there, it was largely missing from the film. The soundtrack was okay otherwise, my favourite new part about it was the theme Elfman composed for Wong. There's also a music battle in the film, which was quite strange and caught me off guard, but somehow worked in a weird way because of the score for that scene.

The trailers definitely gave away too much of this movie, and fans speculated way too much. Going into the film I had very different expectations because of all that, but I was glad to see that the movie was different from what I expected. I admit I am a little disappointed in the simplicity of the plot, and that there were a few missed opportunities; this wasn't the slam dunk I had hoped this would be, but I still really liked this movie! It had some things I've been wanting to see for a while that made me very happy! It's not a cameo-palooza, but I was extremely happy with how the few cameos we got were treated! The film is flawed, and could've used 15 to 20 more minutes to add in some more breathing room as it moves at a breakneck pace and felt rushed at times, and could've gone a little more crazy with the multiverse, but what we got is still pretty good! The movie is an extremely entertaining time at the movies, its a solid new entry into the MCU with such a fresh feel, some great acting and distinctive directing. While it has issues, it is very satisfying and a joy to behold. And as an added bonus... it seems like Feige might be planting the seeds to start setting up a ""Secret Wars"" arc for the MCU! So, this movie may not be as good as the first ""Doctor Strange"", but I thoroughly enjoyed this new chapter and of the MCU, as well as the horrific tone it took on!"
"Pretention, Overly Long, But Smart Ending","Mostly a pretentious, overlong special effects driven, overly repetitive martial arts explosion on the screen. Remarkably what saves this movie is the unexpected soft, movie climax, atypical in most superhero action movies. Everything, Everywhere All At Once (2022) offers the much better simplistic, nicely more straight-forward convoluted multiverse experience of strange."
[7.1] The red phoenix,
Bold story from Marve that only Sam Raimi could pull off,
One-time watch,"This will be one of the few that I'll never likely re-watch. Is it important to see it to understand future films? Maybe. But it isn't one you'll mind taking a bathroom break or two in the middle of. If ""this meeting could have been an e-mail"" was a movie, this was it."
Unnecessarily over complicated.,"Could have been called ""Wanda Vs strange"" and took that route rather than having to make it the sort of a mess that they made .

Could have been a lot better ."
Cringy eye rolls,"Did a 5 year old write this woke garbage? Lame plot, if there was one. These movies get worse and worse. Hang it up Disney. If Lightyear didn't send a message I don't know what will."
Sorcery vs witchcraft,
A big disappointment.,"Will not be revealing anything about the movie.

It was unfortunately a bad cut. Soundtrack from Danny Elfman was giving me a headache not being in sync with the movie and probably the worst work he have ever done in writing the music.

Fast story containing a lot but so little Could have put it on fast forward or recap as it feeling like it is so rushed. When I left the cinema I told my self and the company that it reminded me of the new Star Wars movies. Crap and will probably not watch anything Disney is behind in a long time.

So sad, as this is the end of a era with good movies for some time now coming out. Disney will fail if they continue in the same path. Hope Obi One is made and do the great actors justice this time."
"When Wanda (aka, the Red Witch) says . . .",
Wanda Strange,"All about Wanda and no character development for Strange. Plus too much horror!!! MCU is not supposed to be horror! Dr. Strange is one of my favorite characters and I was excited to learn more about HIM. Not Wanda. Very disappointed.

Zero stars. Do not recommend. Badly done Marvel. Badly done!!!!!!"
This was hard,"I really enjoyed the first one, but this was a hot mess. No originality. Literally pulled ideas from other sources of marvel. At moments i felt like i was watching what If. Then felt like it was wanda vision all over again, and most of the things never made any sense. The whole idea was so horrible i had to just realized i wasted 2hrs watching a movie that should have never been made."
Very imaginative!,"I don't understand the somewhat mixed reviews. Unlike most superhero movies that follow the same recipe, this was an excellent, exceptionally imaginative, smart and original film that borders more on fantasy and the crazy storylines from Dr Strange comics of the golden era (Lee & Kirby) that was highly entertaining.

Very well shot and very creatively written, it's a proper fun ride and Marvel's best movie since the Infinity Saga.

Highly recommended. Please keep an open mind and try to enjoy fantasy movies for what they are. They are not meant to be rational or purposeful, they are meant to take you on a trip. And this one is a hell of a ride from beginning to end!

The new Marvel phase of movies may not be as mainstream as the previous phase was. But they sure seem like they want to focus on storytelling and creating works of hard fantasy/scifi, instead of settling for safe and boring money makers.

This is a bold choice and it may just save an overloaded genre from becoming obsolete."
The special effects here are impressing but their only function is to hide the truth,"The special effects here are impressing but their only function is to hide the truth: this film is like an empty bottle. It has absolutely no Content and I am devastated by the lack of Creativity in this Film in case of Plot!

People rating this film above 6 are judging the book by its Cover and possibly watched it with their eyes wide shut. It's just sad cause I loved Dr. Strange 1...."
Marvelous. Magic. Madness. Multiverse.,"Marvel Studios delivered what they promised. The scariest, horrifying and the darkest movie in the MCU till date. Loved the movie, totally worth the wait for a sequel. Each and every moment gives you goosebumps. A WOW-Factor. Great character development of Wanda Maximoff since her appearance in the Age of Ultron. Sam Raimi totally nailed it, delivered to his peak signature style. Strange's performance was on spot but Wanda, she steals the show. Finally, to all the Marvel Fans, it's a Doctor Strange movie not a Multiversal Crossover. Lastly, the mid-credit scene demands you on wanting more and sets up for the future of MCU as well as for the Doctor Strange."
Over the top fantastic,It's just an excellent movie. I wa a a huge fan of watching Doctor Strange 3D with cannabis - and WandaVision was the same. So Doctor Strange ATMOM 3D with cannabis once again was like visiting old friends - I loved all of the homage to all of the different movies & Easter eggs were everywhere.
Pretty average,"It was a okay movie. Nothing out of ordinary. Cast was great though. But other than that, pretty average. Expected more from this movie to be honest. Especially after No way home. The whole fight was pointless though. There was a clear solution for the whole thing. But instead of that both the party resort to violence. Costume design was great. But there wasn't much of multiverse shown here. Story had too much loopholes. The best thing however was Elizabeth Olsen. I would like to see more of her."
Not why we wanted but still good,
Not bad as it seems not good as it seems .people are actually expecting to much after no way home .,
Perfectly serviceable fun with a cool plot twist,
Dr strange in madness if the witch.,"When i went for the movie... I just went there for story, action, and the continuity of the MCU Timeline. And nothing much.

The story is good and it progresses the story of Wanda from Wanda Vision. Also we got introduction to America Chavez. She is also a great character.

Action was epic the visuals were epic. Ana so does the movie.

Cameos were also there. Some unexpected cameos. I enjoyed the cameos. It felt fresh for me.

You will be thrilled throughout the movie.

So this movie is packed with of action, visuals, nice story, new concept. Good continuity of the timeline. So this movie deserves a 9/10.

I am taking 1 star because of a scene, where I felt nostalgic and a minute after I was shocked because of a scene."
HAVE CAPE WILL TRAVEL...!,"The Mouse House's latest Marvel MCU chapter has our master of the mystic arts journeying through the multiverse (hence the title) to protect a being, Xochitl Gomez, who can transport herself through the verse using star shaped portals, & is being pursued by the newly asserted Scarlet Witch, Elizabeth Olsen, who wants to usurp her power to save her sons (established in the WandaVision series). Sam Raimi returns to the fold as the director (after having directed the Tobey Maguire Spideys in the aughts) after original director Scott Derrickson (who helmed the first Strange) departed the project due to creative differences & as a piece of entertainment, I thought it worked but rumblings are underway that maybe the MCU's interconnectedness may be fraying at the seams as the roster of films released so far (& to be released) during this Phase 4 (?) must connect w/the on going TV series (which have been pretty damn good so far sans Loki which I didn't care for) & beyond. Not a likely position for me to envy but hey unlike DCU (at this point it may change w/the Discovery channel merger now a factor for their upcoming output) which seemed to have thrown up their hands in surrender to let directors direct, giving their slate individual touches which may not be necessarily found in the Marvel camp but as long as the audience's appetite hasn't slackened for their product, they will continue to forge ahead which only time will tell if it's a sound decision."
Doctor strange is back,"Epic movie, Personally my favourite one and Sam Raimi is back as a director with a massive movie which is a full competition for Spiderman No -Way home both films have different directors but the similarity is Doctor Strange ( Benedict Cumberbatch) and Wong (Benedict Wong) and with America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) IN a Restaurant they were talking about Spiderman and that was hilarious that America Chavez didn't know who is spiderman Lol what a joke but I'm sure that Tom Holland didn't mind this he is so humble and that's America Chavez(Xochitl Gomez ) debut for MCU and Scarlett Witch / Wanda Maximoff ( Elizabeth Olsen is so pretty well actress her acting skills are seriously mind-blowing and all the characters Baron Mordo( Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Dr. Christine Pal (Rachel McAdams ) marriage scene was so heart breaking after all Doctor Strange loves him but obviously that's a movie so no offence.

Looking forward for Doctor Strange another Sequel."
Pointless mashup of MCU and horror genre,While I understand that Marvel don't want to repeat the previous phase but that would be better than this. It's frustrating that the tone has moved from family friendly superhero to this. I think they can do something cool with the multiverse but pandering to people who want a more violent more visceral feel is a mistake. Realistic violence is important to some franchises like game of thrones but it has no relevance to the MCU.
D I S A P P O I N T M E N T,"Man, such a disappointment of a movie. It was a boring watch at times and reminded of a teenager TV movies. I just hope Marvel isn't going that way.

Story? So much hassle for such a cliche Wanda's realization in the end. I mean, it was probably the worst thing I've seen from Marvel so far. Just an overhyped disappointing teenager Tv movie."
"""I love you in every universe""","Superhero movie, No... Time travel movie, No... Horror film, No... Broken love story, well... It's all in there, EVERYTHING.

I love everything from beginning to the end. While it may leave some questions for some of us, I find this movie very entertaining, with clever story telling and a lot of surprises. I rated this movie above Spider-Man no way home because of a better story, actions and how it was directed. Sam Raimi did an excellent job with it, so did everyone in the team as well.

Steven Strange - ""I love you in every universe"". Best Quote of the movie."
"Best movie, but can get a bit confusing.","The movie has been executed very well, with great VFX and perfect storyline. Benedict's and Elizabeth's acting was perfectly fitted. But even for me, a person with great knowledge about Marvel, it got a bit confusing. If you're just starting off with the MCU world, I wouldn't recommend this movie."
Doc Strange 2,"So, COVID may not have killed the MCU entirely but to horribly paraphrase Whiplash from Iron Man 2, COVID made Marvel bleed and I'm starting to lose my belief in them.

Dr Strange 2: Multiverse Boogaloo, while not a bad movie was just terribly... Meh. It may be one of the most poorly paced films I've seen in the MCU, which is something. The movie feels like its about 3 hours long and yet it doesn't take the time to really live in any of the moments I would like it to. I'm not feeling like any of these big character movements are really earned or make sense. Even the CGI is... It's fine? At some points its really good and at others you'd forget that this is the bajillion dollar money making franchise and for such an effects driven movie, having those effects not work is death.

This is tough for me. As a long time MCU fan, I just can't help but feel they're losing a step in the post-COVID world. Black Widow was a mess, Spider-Man was a blast but isn't sticking with me the way I'd like it to and lets just not even talk about Eternals. Maybe it's just the shift to Disney+ and their lineup of great shows. Maybe this is the time where we stop having such expectations for the movies and start putting attention back to the series. I know I was way more captivated during Wandavision, Loki, Falcon, Hawkeye and What If than I was for anything going on here.

Conversely, maybe Doc Strange just isn't my jam. First one wasn't anything spectacular to me either, maybe I shouldn't expect greatness from this. Maybe it needs the Thor treatment of two mediocre films and Taika can take over for Doctor Strange: Ragnarok and I'll be all in."
looks cheap,"I love the sam rami aspect of this movie, its got some horror and grotesque aspects that i love, but the cgi is probably the worst of the mcu, wandas feet in some scenes are obvious that she's wearing feet-shoes, the monsters look OK at best, the acting is ok, nothing spectacular, and wanda as a character just isn't special, i like some scenes but the movie as a whole is very mid for me. And its disappointing because the first doctor strange is my favorite mcu of all time, and its kinda sad how not-special this movie is. Sometimes it just feels like cameos of characters that we haven't seen before. ""ooh look, theres peggy carter, i know her from that one comic!"" i just dont care. Im personally a bigger dc fan and the recent mcu movies is why. Nothing but cgi and action without a deep and interesting story, its just surface-level action. Dc at least has character depth. Just go watch the batman, you'll have a better experience and its way better than this movie, not that this is terrible, the batman is just better."
Not Sure How I Feel About This One,
"Multiverse of Sadness, for sure.","When you hear Raimi is back to make a Marvel movie, the excitement hits the ceiling. Little did I knew that I'd get flashbacks of Toby's spiderman while watching MOM. Such a poor show. Poor story, poor plot, poor climax, poor background score. Nothing in the movie is worth watching, not even the end credits scenes! This is the time when Marvel should consider about making good movies because the dive after Endgame is not looking to end and the likes of Olsen, Cummber batch seems to be taking the fall as they have given what they could to this sinking ship. The story goes nowhere, the climax dialogue is such a petty one that I tasted my own puke, and the fights are horrible, specially between strange and sinister strange. My last hopes are with Thor and should that be another disaster, I'm done with Marvel."
Cut to shreds - predictable and.. Marvel,"I'm glad Sam Raimi did this. But it's easy to spot it still has to follow marvel formula.

The movie has been cut and it shows. Everything just runs by and the scenes don't take effect until we rush into the next. Damn studios that shorten length of the movie

You notice it in the weak, hasty dialog. The on the nose comments. Endless jokes in the middle of a moment. Lack of natural exposition and the movie carries on like a clarity for everyone - I did find the phasing a bit weird and character actions the same. But it's an interesting movie and marvel's best visually since... Iron man 1 era? Effects are good but the scary moments are ruined by how they are placed there to be... Scary and not natural."
"Manage expectations going in. Not terrible, not great.","I think too many of us expected this film to be the one that would finally unveil the larger story at play within phase four of the MCU, which is not the case.

If you approach this as a Doctor Strange movie on its own (for the most part), then you should be able to enjoy it for what it is: Two hours on a psychedelic rollercoaster that wades into elements of horror enough that it may surprise you. I personally loved that touch. But some may find it too much, particularly for kids in their preteens or under.

It's certainly fun to watch, and there are plenty of visually stunning scenes. This film also maintains a steady pace from start to finish; there isn't a slow moment throughout the entire thing. However, I doubt anyone would deeply regret waiting to watch it until it becomes available on Disney+ either.

The positive aspects cannot offset the film's several noticeable flaws. Both the script and storyline are weak, arguably negligent. The attempts at humor continually fail to connect.

For all the visually gratifying scenes there is also a fair share of shockingly inadequate CGI effects. Which is highly noticeable since the vast majority of the movie is shot using green screens and CGI. The discrepancies from one scene or effect to the next is perplexing. It's as though certain parts were incomplete but included anyway due to budgetary concerns or deadlines.

My other big gripe is the characters and their stories weren't explored thoroughly enough to justify why we suddenly find them in their current emotional and logical states. We're thrust into a story where the actions and motives of the characters (although partially) don't fully align with where we last left them. Even being caught up on all things Marvel, it feels like I missed a show or movie somewhere (I haven't) that could explain the most recent shifts. It just seems like lazy writing, to be honest. These characters and their stories deserve better."
Convenient is the word.,"Everything is so convenient, the use of some powers, the placement of objects that can save everything, some of the lines are pretty bad, but it's a pretty movie, funny at times, but some of the jokes are terrible.

If you're a fan, you're going to love it, if you're not a fan, you're going to hate it, if you're like me, someone who doesn't give a flying f for superhero movies anymore it's going to be an okay experience."
"One word, DISAPPOINTING.",
"SKIP IT! It's a Multiverse of Bad CGI, No Plot, and No Character Development.","THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE! Four thumbs down 👎👎👎👎 (I'm including my big toes). Do not waste your money and time watching it in theaters or at home. I'm an MCU superfan and I found every aspect of this film to have lazy dialog, near-constant bad CGI action filler, and devoid of all meaning or intellectual enjoyment. There are a few moments of joy, but they are quickly thrown away in service of its nonsensical ""plot"". This is a cheap visual popcorn rollercoaster at best, but it's a total disservice to the franchise as a whole. The multiverse has enormous potential and these characters deserved better. 😔"
"Fun, But Wanted to Like it More",
Not much multi-verse and many lost opportunities,
Multi-Headache,"The multiverse gets on my nerves - but the marvel action is still there...with a tinge more darkness. I don't know that the storyline is very compelling, either - America's character being the one they didn't develop enough for you to connect to."
Doctor Strange and Sam Raimi are a perfect fit.,
Disservice to WandaVision,
When Are They Going to Get to the Fireworks Factory?,"I will try to review this movie for what it is as opposed to comparing it to what I wanted it to be. At this point in the MCU, expectations are high for each new movie. And with the return of OG Spider-Man 2 director returning to helm this, expectations from fans were understandably high.

This film had a lot on its plate. It had to be a follow-up to ""WandaVision"", follow up to ""Spider-Man No Way Home"" and a sequel to ""Dr. Strange"". Not to mention, the film has to face fan demand for bringing together this ""multiverse""

Not since ""Thor: Ragnarök"" has a director in the MCU so effectively put their fingerprints on the DNA of their film. This movie is 100% Sam Raimi's movie. I am a huge fan of Raimi, and this film is full of classic ""Evil Dead"" style. The MCU is at its best when they allow the director to their job and let their vision shine.

I love the action sequences in this movie. They are visceral, brutal and exciting. Danny Elfman's music helps hype up everything to the next level. Every set piece feels like it is the caliber of the top tier superhero finale. But that is a two-edged sword. When all the action scenes feel like a finale, when we get to the actual finale, it comes across as lackluster. As such the ending falls flat.

Sadly the emotional core of this movie does not resonate with me. I do not sympathize with the main person our heroes are trying to protect. It is amazing how little I learn about them throughout the film, but how everything I do learn about them does nothing to endear me to them.

I love the villain of this story. But when you take a look at their plan, it clearly is not fully thought through. The way things conclude can't help but draw comparison to a superior multiverse film ""Spiderverse"". And there are some points of exposition that don't make any sense when you think about it.

The film isn't awful by any means. Part of the MCU's secret to success is their track record of very solid movies, and this one holds true to that. Just at this point in the MCU, and with this combination of elements, I should be loving this film. But I do inevitably walk away disappointed. And that is the strangest part of all."
Multiverse of Madness,
What?,"I absolutely loved the first Doctor Strange film.

This movie is.. just aweful. It''s boring, through and through. Nevermind the meh plot and issues with continuity, it's yawn inducing madness.

I get what the movie was, what it was about, why it is what it is, but non of those nuggets are worth investing several boring hours for."
"Great movie, but a lil messey",
This Is Not What I Expected,"Bad acting and foolish expressions from Xochitl Gomez. Wanda part is too much and OP for me. Dr strange doesn't look like a super hero more like mediator. The illuminati cameo so pointless.

Overall failed."
What is Love But Grief Persevering Part 2,"Watched Doctor Strange And The Multiverse Of Madness with Benedict Cumberbatch(Spider-Man: No Way Home) as Stephen Strange/Doctor Strange, Xochitl Gomez(The Babysitters Club) as America Chavez, Rachel McAdams(Eurovision Song Contest) As Christine Palmer, Elizabeth Olsen(Wandavision) as Wanda Maximoff/The Scarlet Witch, Benedict Wong(Top Boy) as Wong, Chiwetel Ejiofor(The Old Guard) as Baron Mordo, and Sir Patrick Stewart(Logan, Picard) as Charles Xavier/Professor X.

I understand the Pacing and writing criticism but I felt that Wanda Maximoff being a sympathetic Anti-Hero or Anti- Villain was in it from the get-go anyone who has lost anyone should know people do some drastic things just to preserve what they have just to get through the day fans and critics are missing the point it just makes Earth-199999 Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch are more interesting character I like Ben Solo/Kylo Ren from The Sequel Trilogy did i agree with her actions no but she is a victim none the less also she paid with her life and atoned for her sins that how carried into this from Wandavision I enjoyed The Horror Elements even they were equivalent to 2020s The New Mutants which were Light also awesome to the MCU expanding going back What is Love But Grief Persevering Part 2

Score By Danny Elfman(Spider-Man), Cinematography by John Mathieson(X-Men: First Class), and Direction by Sam Raimi(Army Of Darkness) What is Love But Grief Persevering Part 2 9/10."
Sam Raimi has lost his touch in direction.,"I watched the movie without ever knowing the legendary Sam Raimi(Evil Dead, Darkman, Army Of Darkness) was directing it. It was only when a Bruce Campell cameo scene appeared, that I knew my old friend Sam was in the director's chair.

To see Bruce in a Marvel film is quite extraordinary. The movie itself can be compared to be catered to a very young audience like children for example. Thus this one can be enjoyed by a family. The special effects are okay but not mind-blowing because C. G. I. Has been done to death in recent years.

I'm not a big fan of Doctor Strange and just saw this one to pass the time and just barely did that."
FULL ON MADNESS,""" Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness""

Ooooof, really a total madness experienced...

Darkhold , multiverse concept, many doctor stranges, many wanda, a culmination of fiction and madness was being experienced...

Overall a one time watchable movie... After Moon Knight, I felt madness after watching Doctor Strange 2."
I really feel the smell of burning...,"Every time I see a Marvel movie (and I have seen them all ... they are so ""pumped"" by advertising that one cannot avoind to see them) then when I go to see the ratings on this site I am always perplexed ... I've seen another movie? This movie 7.2 ... Captain Marvel 6.8 ... (just to name two really bad ones). It's like there is a +2 added automatically ... then you look at a lot of the reviews and most of them are negative. I repeat I really feel the smell of burning... This heavily affects the credibility of the evaluations ... at least about Marvel movies. As if there were ""someone"" pushing them upwards ..."
Sam Raimi's introduction to the MCU is a fun one,"The good: Sam Raimi's direction is excellent. The film's pace is brisk and a nice break from the 3 hour epics marvel has been producing lately. The action is plentiful and the magic is magical. The acting is top knotch from everyone involved and the visuals are just as trippy as the first film. There are certain emotional bits the film needed to nail and it does indeed nail it.

The bad: Wanda being the bad guy again. I had genuinely thought she put that behind her in Wandavision, so for her to turn bad again in this was kind of a waste. The end credit scene was also kind of lackluster, but does set up for the next film in the series.

Overall: I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was funny and fun, with some great emotional moments thrown in there as well. I would say more but I'm trying not to give any spoilers. I recommend it to anyone who is a Marvel fan, but do watch Wandavision, or you might miss out on some of the subtext. 4 multiverse leaps out of 5."
I want to have the stuff the writers smoked before writing this movie,"I know I'm about to say something unpopular but this movie didn't make sense.

The only thing I can save is the special effects but otherwise I haven't seen a believable storyline, interesting characters or a decent script.

I have seen epic battles and the death of dozens of characters (I also include extras) without feeling the slightest pathos and this is because you can't prove anything if you don't know them a bit. Instead many of them appeared for a couple of minutes, fought and died. Perfect examples are the Illuminati and the Shangri-La School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where students die in handfuls without anyone wondering why they have to die so stupidly. Another question I asked myself is how Scarlet witch knew about America's existence at the beginning of the movie and how she could find it since America ends up in our universe by chance running away from a demon supposedly sent by Scarlet herself.

The answer could be the cursed book but this still does not explain why there is a temple with the statue of Scarlet witch on the top of the Himalayas and what those 4 monsters on steroids were doing there. I remember that the temple must have been built millennia earlier. There would be dozens of other things to point out but I don't want to be picky."
Evil Dead and the Multiverse of Exposition,"This movie was exactly what I expected it to be: a tame Evil Dead vs. Dr. Strange crossover.

I hated it when it tried to be a comic book superhero film, but I loved it when it tried to play like a funny-creepy horror like Raimi's classics.

I welcome the endeavor of hiring a director with a completely different vision for this film in order to make it feel fresh and distinct from the Marvel basics. Although the film felt like the experiment had gone too far.

Everything was out of place, and because the film moved at such a slow pace, it seemed to last forever. The acting and line delivery were bizarre, the action was shot in the most boring way possible (except for one scene), and the editing was occasionally confusing due to time freezing between scenes.

Overall, while I laughed a lot because some scenes were so bizarre (allegedly intentional or self-ironic), I'd still watch a more traditional comic book film rather than this one.

5 stars out of 10. Two for Bruce Campbell obligatory cameo, two for the Oldsmobile obligatory cameo, and one for the music notes massacre."
SCARLET WITCH IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS PLUS DR STRANGE,"Honestly imo if there was a special point over 10 I'd give it. This movie, nay this masterpiece, one of raimi's many, is gory, frightening, and nothing like marvel has ever done. U can thank Elizabeth Olsen and Sam raimi for that. Some bits need more time but there was so much depth and meaning to deconstruct and it was mind blowing."
Doctor Strange will return,"I couldn't watch the Disney+ IMAX Enhanced Version because the quality default set on 240p, even if I selected the HD quality, so I had to find other ways to watch it in high definition.

A fresh of breath air in the MCU, courtesy of Sam Raimi. His signature styles were visible throughout this film. I wouldn't call this film an epic superhero action flick, because this film is more in the arena of emotional drama, with dark horror elements than action spectacle filled with destructive battle sequences. It's not Raimi's fault the film had some hiccups, it's mostly the half cooked screenplay by Michael Waldron.

Fantastic stellar performances by Elizabeth Olsen, Benedict Cumberbatch and Xochitl Gomez. Olsen's performance was outstanding and mesmerizing. She deserves all the awards."
Good GFX and weak villain backdrop,"RATED 7/10 Language: English Source: Hotstar

Another Marvel sequel, which we cant avoid because to understand the further sequels.... The title is so opt and it was so madness with multi verse... The GFX is so awesome and make this movie as with a watch. The reason for the Villain spoils the big universal fight...But the GFX and some nice action sequences compromises that... Good weekend entertainer..."
Another Disneyfied Marvel formula which could not dot justice to two great characters played by great actors.,"Not enough Multiverse, Too much of macguffin.

New Character introduced just to open multiverse and forgot anything happened in previous movies and tv shows. Wanda's character that built in her show, ruined.

Boring and unnecessary cameos.

Forgettable dialogues. No particularly good action sequences. Sometimes it feels like Dr. Strange is a side character like No way home.

Visually inferior to original Dr. Strange and his sequence in Infinity war.

Plot was almost as bad as Wonder woman 1984.

Only sharp editing and Marvel vfx team makes it an average movie.

Predictable and generic scenes without much suspense or build up.

Writers of wandavision show, loki, and captain america movies are really missed by Marvel.

After Endgame, non of the movies had memorable dialogues, action scenes or music.

Eternals was failed and same with this one.

Hope Taika bring back the LOST charm of MCU."
A very underwhelming film,For some people it may or may not live up to the hype!.Sam raimi has done a good job with wonderful actors but the movie was needed to be little bit longer. Cameos are ok but not many cameos. NOT MY CUP OF TEA.
Horribly cheesy and boring,"This movie is so cheesy and boring... Difficult to watch at times. No suspense of course. Characters as shallow as Marvel demands (Infinite War was an odd exception).

And the teaser with Theron shows that the costume design and makeup are getting uglier with each installment. Yikes. Star Wars episode 1 might soon lose the crown of bad taste.

3 is generous. The music is fine at times and some battles too. That's about it."
Messy delivery on a film that couldn't pick a genre.,"So I had high hopes for this movie and was pretty disappointed. The movie starts off very abruptly, but then does not scale back to give a nice building foundation to what will happen later. I found that the biggest areas of concern were pacing and editing. I am sure there were lots of behind the scene disagreements between the director and Disney, as the first 1.5 acts of this film felt like a sci-fi/superhero film, and then the rest progressed to an attempt to make a horror film. The plot itself was a bit sloppy, and I wish they had committed to making a Marvel horror movie rather than the tug-of-war between genres that was produced.

This movie seems to be a vehicle to introduce some larger concepts/elements to the MCU, but was done in a rushed and underwhelming way that cheapened the whole experience.

The VFX and concept visuals were all very well done of course, and the visual aspect of this film is what most of the stars are going to in my review."
Fundamental incoherence redeemed by talented OGs,
Good Trailer ... Bad Movie,
"Worth a watch, but don't expect too much",
The special effects were amazing...But the CGI was terrible?,"Yeah theres too many reviews...in order to stand out I need to say what bothered me the most. And that was the CGI. Thats the octopus, the alternate city...block and the ultron robots. All of which looked god awful. Why?

The special effects were the same as the rest of the marvel universe...Fantastic!. So why not the CGI? I hope VFX artists tear it apart.

And So if they did have good special effects why is the first time I noticed Christine's...well. Big hairy mole? THe movie just started and they shove it right in my face. Its not just behind that one strand of hair...It ""has"" hair. Long black hair too..

Great movie...well mostly. Somewhere near the end they decide to really draw out each shot. A lot is happening..the theme is urgency, and yet the characters and the camera hold on shots for way way longer than they should."
Terrible,
Dross,American Chavez!!! Who can travel across dimensions through a star portal. Just to Americanised for me. The Marvel films since Avengers Endgame have gone down hill pretty fast. Although it was not as bad as that utter pish otherwise known as Eternals.
Why every woman needs to be put as a crazy woman?,
Why do I have a bad taste in my mouth while watchng this...??,
"Critics are useless, go see it for yourself. It's a blast.",
"""Best Marvel Movie Of All Time""","Action packed, great story line, Sam Raimi did an awesome job with the visual effects. It had lots of jump scares and bloody violent scenes when all the cameos came in. I would recommend the movie being at least 14A, but over all one of the best movie I have seen before also great Halloween movie. Plus it was a different kind of Marvel movie in the direction it went and it was very successful."
Dr Snooze in the Sleepyverse of Snorefest,"Dr Strange has never been about woke cringe - you'd think magic, spells and all manner of arcane shenanigans would be the primary purpose of such a movie. Well my ever optimistic movie enthusiast, you'd be wrong!! Dr Strange in the multiverse of madness is a dripping with every sly, or overt nod to demented woke dogma you could imagine. I stopped watching after I saw the two deranged women posing as 'moms' to the Mary Sue character of unimaginable power we're forced to endure for the length of the movie. I spit this tepid manure out of my mouth about then. I reject your perversion Hollywood. You might want to normalise every disgusting thing you can conjure up from the pits of hell itself, but I don't. Another potentially great movie ruined by degenerates burrowed deeply inside of the entertainment industry. 1 out of 10 from me."
It's ok,"Nowhere near as good as the first one, but still a watchable movie. It goes pretty fast, has lots of cool fight scenes, and some really good special effects. The story sucks a big bag of Doritos - and the acting from all the young cast is awful. Benedict looks a little bored and uninspired - but he does a good enough job with the material. Huge waste of a few extra characters and obviously Wanda is a lame villain."
"A film that could have been great, but unfortunately was only mediocre.",
Yes Marvel keep trying different things!,"I'm not a critic or a cynical person, I'm also not a hardcore Marvel fan or read the comics, but I do go out to the cinemas and watch it with friends because its like a tradition to.

My review is simple.. It's entertaining and different. After 28 movies, you sort of get bored of the same run of the mill action-comedy formula.

The horror definitely got me at some points and I love that."
A CGI film with emotionless acting,"This movie was so hyped....and I was into the hype. The first Dr strange was so good, great pacing and progression with great acting and story. This film however focuses on cgi battles and stale conflict with little actual emotional acting. Some scenes could've been much more sinister and impactfull if the actors were up for it. I think Marvel has to take notes from The Boys and start creating actual villains."
No worlds. Just excitement and pain for Wanda,"It was just amazing, I was right not to believe what the critics and the negative comments said. Elizabeth Olsen is the boss in the movie. She is the lead actress. She made her character awesome and scary. Action scenes perfect executed. Visual effects also very awesome and the whole cast gave their best performance and that's a success."
Too ambitious of a movie.,
This is actually one of the best Marvel movies ever.,
"The motivations make no sense, but the movie does look good",
A FOUNDATION TYPE,"First of all, those who are giving counter reviews did either not watch Wanda Vision and What If or went to see this movie with high level of expectations. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a very good movie to enjoy in theater.

This movie is basically a kind of introduction to what the multiversal concept will be like in phase 4. From the perspective of Wanda and Stephen Strange, the terrible aspects of Dark Magic and Multiverse are highlighted throughout the movie. So it is foolishness to expect Cameo Roles to turn the world upside down in this kind of movie. Movie Plot Simple. The main purpose here is to show how Doctor Strange manages the bad situation created by Wanda's emotional ride and multiversal access. And in order to tackle this situation, he has to face various multiversal threats throughout the movie. There are a lot of connections to Marvel's previous multiversal concepts and dark magic projects, and there is a lot of accuracy with comics. There were a lot of unexpected and instant shocking moments in the movie that really fit into the power and reality of Dark Magic. The downside, though, is that Tv Spots and Trailers have shown a lot of things that shouldn't have been done. But that doesn't indicate this movie is not good.

The visual was very stunning in almost the whole movie. According to the concept of the movie, there were dark and creepy tones throughout the movie, Originally, there was a horror vibe in which director Sam Raimi was skilled. But I expected more Screen time tbh. The action sequence was also really eye-catching. Besides, the background score or music of the movie was very interesting yet Satisfying ...

Overall, this movie is not really like the other traditional Marvel movies. It has a different dark vibe and a unique vision and I obviously liked the approach. So, 8/10 from me."
"Pretty solid, for a Marvel movie.","I wouldn't give more than 8 stars to a marvel production, since they lack personality in and out of themselves and on the scale of movie viewing, I can't help but being critical, with exceptions concerning the shows ( which are developed quite differently.)

First of, the best thing about this movie : Sam Raimi's directing. People may not realize it on the first screening, where they may have a hard time ""getting into it"" if they are not used to more creative cinema processes in the MCU ( which we can't blame them for since a lot of people pretty much overrate marvel production and never got interested in the subtleties of movie-making, which is perfectly understandable and I don't think this movie is too abrupt either.) It feels a little OVNI-like, and at the same time is very MCU-friendly, more than the Eternals.

But that's the thing ; Where it lies strong, it has bleeding weaknesses.

The shots can be a little kitsch and stereotyped, although that's part of Raimi's style - at times, he is far more creative than the MCU has ever been in terms of camera movements. On a technical standpoint, this takes a big dump on 90% of Marvel's recent visually insipid productions. But you FEEL like he was limited. You feel that he wanted to give certain shots / scenes more time to establish themselves ( not Marvel's cup of tea, you want to keep the ADHD kids entertained. ) This causes a couple of issues, like the lack of a real simmering in certain ambiances, to the point you'd want some kind of mellow middle where the characters really have time to grow on you ; there is a bit of that sprinkled here and there, but ultimately, it's overwhelming of nonstop action and conflict. It's a manhunt.

I also have a hard time with the fact that they keep Fan-servicing you out of a linear story. As the trailers suggested, we'll have a snippet of new characters, but their role is basically minimal and insignificant - they are time fillers. Cool fights, cool scenes ; but the rhythm is too intense and it's hard to ""split"" and take the time to bathe in it. Which isn't a Raimi's issue, I'd add. It's the constant shackles he's got on his wrists that almost defuse a lot of what he's trying to do. A lot has been cut. The horrific elements come out of nowhere, you feel the potential at times but IT GOES TOO FAST !

At least the tone is darker, meaner and more dangerous than other marvel movies. But it's not ""scary"" either, more ""threatening"", and you'll only be partially invested.

Anyway, Good use of music. Danny Elfman underperforms, but over the MCU it's pretty expected.

Fight scenes have really good ideas, Doctor Strange is the Disneyland of superhero power fantasies.

Wanda's story is powerful and yet blurry if you haven't seen Wandavision, so watch it first. She's a little disturbing sometimes, doesn't feel like Wanda from the show. But that enforces how deeply she's been marked by her losses.

The movie is a little too filled to the bone, between Strange emotional journey, Wanda's one, The multiverse characters, America Chavez... It never stops. Which I kinda liked, felt like an action packed comic book. But, I have to say : this should have been a movie about Wanda. It should have intelligently recapped Wandavision, too. And the story with Mordo ( an old pal of Dr. Strange ) should have been explored in Strange 2 instead of skipping directly to the multiversal delirium. There was, like, a movie missing in between the two. It could have saved us a couple of minutes and made this story more... digestible; but I liked it. Entertaining, refreshing at times - not too forgettable. Did the job."
Strange movie,
Dr. Strange jumps the shark,The multiverse has become a crutch for lazy Marvel writers to avoid consistency and make it up as they go. Note this movie is not at all kid friendly and should really be rated R for the amount of violence & gore. It is much darker than the first Dr. Strange.
Movie premyy honest review,"Doctor Strange: In the Multiverse of Madness is visually scary yet stunning, and mesmerizing. The first half is exciting, and the highlight of the show. The second half though could have been better. The film is unique and fun surely one of the bests of marvel studious still feels like something is missing (maybe I expected a bit more). Nevertheless, this is the experience that you should not miss especially if you are premyy of Elizabeth Olsen and scarlet witch! 😍"
Oh my God,"I don't even know what to compare it to. Of course, I understood that civilization is heading towards the end, but everything is happening too fast. I think that the movie ""Idiocracy"" was prophetic. Soon we'll all be watching far**ng a*s. And this film will win an Oscar for several years in a row. I can't describe my frustration with the Marvel movies. The film studio was taken over by drug addicts. Pardon my ""French""."
M She U reigns supreme,"We get it, women are wonderful and even when they're evil it's not their fault. And straight white men are wrong, stupid, or evil. Cameos were all a waste and Dr Strange might just be the dumbest character in the MCU now."
*Yawn*,"This multiverse gimmick needs to stop. Now. It gives Marvel/Disney carte blanche to essentially manipulate the history of all characters, which in turn devalues the time we've spent with them in the past. I'm so not interested in following Marvel down this flagrantly money-grabbing path."
A good doctor strange movie,"Better than homecoming by a mile. Would've been so much better if they didn't cut so many scenes. Because you can feel the cuts especially in the second half of the movie. But in general succesful story flow, good acting, a reasonable evil, beautiful cinematography. 8/10 but cause of the general rating is low I'm giving 10/10. I wonder what rating people gave to Spider-Man No Way Home. This one is clearly a better movie."
Disappointed,"I have to say, I was disappointed with my theater experience watching this movie. First, after traveling some distance to see it the AMC Jersey Gardens Dolby Theater in NJ, the theatrical sound was awful. You'd think Dolby would insist its premium branded theater experiences were meticulously maintained. Not so. The sound system was glaringly load and distorted. To wit, we all experienced tinnitus for days after! Louder is not better. Worse, the sound cut out entirely for about five minutes during the key moment of the movie! And for THIS we should all be returning to movie houses?

Maybe I'm spoiled. My home theater setup is awesome, and our only reason to venture out is to experience a BIG screen or early release. I could have saved my hard earned cash and waited for it to arrive on Disney+. Lesson learned? Save the box office money and buy a bigger screen at home!

Ah! The movie, right. Well, creds to superb acting by Olsen and Cumberbatch. Unfortunately, the plot depth - or lack of it - is more befitting a comic book episode. It felt like a two-hour trailer for Marvel things to come rather than any sort of involving story line. That said, plenty of Marvel comics were simply tie lines to other plots.

Forewarned is forearmed. For the cost of dragging the family out at these prices, I can probably double our at-home screen size by saving on a few major releases - and have a more enjoyable experience overall."
What was that,"Waste of the multiverse just like Spider-Man no way home I mean there was some cool moves but the screenplay was lacking of substance and coherence just like everything marvel has done since End game of you think about it....they should have just merge the story of America with Everything everywhere all at once( since the Russo brother are producers in it) cause that movie was by far the best, along with Spider-Man into the spider verse, at handling the multiverse...so I don't see why they needed to introduce America with a movie call dr strange when it could have been her movie with dr strange in it...so far I'm still waiting for something great cause Eternals, Spider-Man, dr strange, Morbius, Shang chi and all the series I mean there's just something missing."
A solid and different MCU movie,"The good thing about this movie is a certain originality and tone that sets it apart from the rest of the MCU movies. Given that the director is Raimi, who has made several very good horror films, we also see several elements of horror here, which is unusual for this franchise. I'm not sure how many people will accept it, but I think it's a positive. Visually, it's a very sumptuous film, but I personally was a bit bothered by the large amount of effects and CGI. I didn't expect that from Raimi, who normally prefers practical effects. Looking at the title of the film, I think that its full potential was not used, except for a very cool (what else to call it) scene in the middle of the film that was obviously made for fans, but overall the film does not contribute anything. For my taste, the main character is missing a bit more because the movie is still called Dr. Strange, not Wanda. A solid and slightly different MCU movie and nothing more."
"A fun, wacky ride that shakes up the formula.","While this movie isn't exactly the most ""important"" in the MGU's general storyline, nor is it anything absolutely incredible when compared to other, better superhero movies, M. O. M does something that I haven't seen in the MGU for quite some time, and that's trying something new.

A lot of people have talked on how Marvel movies feel very stale, and I'd definitely have to agree.

I think we're all just tired of the formula, we excused it during the Infinty Saga because of how hyped up Endgame was, but once it was over, I'm sure we all saw that Disney was desperately trying to make a new connected storyline to keep people watching.

With all the Disney+ shows being green lit, and the next phase of movies being confirmed so quickly, it's clear to me that they were trying to light the fire the moment it was put out, and in some of these new releases, you can see it.

Movies like Eternals and Black Widow weren't what I would call something fun or exciting to watch, at least anymore times than once or twice. They just exist to slap some future stuff out there to get people invested in seeing a connected storyline.

Dr. Strange is a movie that sets in motion future plot lines, but it doesn't make that the main focus.

The main focus is to make a fun, enjoyable experience that can be rewatched just for the insanely enjoyable moments this film contains.

Dr. Strange has always been my favorite superhero since I first laid eyes on his abilities in Infinty War, and this movie takes the concept of the Mystic Arts to it's peak, truly giving us the concept that it's more than just orange disks and mirror dimensions. Not to mention the entire new angle it's presented at. Sam Raimi's vision may not be as loud as his other projects, but it's noticeable enough to where it's a breath of fresh air if you've been a fan of this series of films like me.

The faults of the movie are present, and there is no deny that it's nothing worthy of absolute worship, but the fact that it's different is deserving of credit. I don't think we should sweep it under the rug and rope it in with other ""average Marvel movies"".

I think the things the movie does to make itself stand out should be noted heavily, because who knows? Maybe we'll get more experimental directions, or risqué shocking moments.

If you want a fun time with creative fight scenes, or if you're simply burnt out on the typical Marvel formula, I'd say it's worth a watch."
Not for everyone,"Marvel fans might not like it. True Marvel Fans will love it. It's Dark . Very Dark. Close to horror. Wanda steals the show.

Dr Strange is more of a side act. The Scarlett witch is whom the movie is about."
Not a Marvel/ Dr.Strange Movie,This did not feel like most marvel movies (not counting the sad Captain Marvel attempt) . Elizabeth Olsen's overconfidence was evident in her below standard acting. She was so amazing in the past Avengers line. This is not the Wanda i expected. Not a Dr. Strange movie. The second post credit was not required.
"Interesting, messy writing though, too woke",It was good but the writing was quite messy. It's just all getting too woke for me to enjoy properly anymore. The forced female roles every 5 seconds is just feeling unnatural.
Amazing movie! Must see!,"I loved the movie! I don't care what haters think! Go see if for yourself!

Epic, darkness, madness and more! Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing!

Worth the wait! Hope next comes faster!"
Visual feast.,"As with the first ""Doctor Strange"" movie this is heavily dependent on visuals. It has been called a horror and though there are some horror aspects I wouldn't call it a horror as such. It is however probably the most visually violent.

It obviously opens up a lot of possibilities for the future of the franchise but I'll let you find out what they are by yourself.

There are some great introductions and cameos and lots of call backs to Sam Raimis previous movies.

It is still very much a superhero movie so don't go and expect a total departure from the rest of the MCU."
Ok,
Solid But Not Spectacular,
Mutant alert!,"The Scarlet Witch really needs to meet the Phoenix Force. Whoever therm archenemy is for this season, I hope tha the MCU incorporates the contributions of the XMEN franchise, because after all, Wanda is an Xmen."
Good for a Marvel movie,
Wanda's Madness in So called Multiverse.,They could have done so many things but did absolutely nothing. Storyline is joke. It has everything you might expect but nothing you need. I don't understand the idea of giving Wanda so much power while Dr. Strange is helpless in front of her.
"Hmm, Strange happiness from where?",
Not up to expectation.,
Terrible,This movie was ok and then america chavez came out. I thought I was watching Doctor Strange 2 and not chavez origin story. Plus there were so many unattractive people in this movie I couldn't watch it most of the time and kept having to focus my eyes on the background.
More Scarlet Witch Lessor Strange,"I find it more about Scarlet Witch / Wanda rather then Strange.

But then again, it has to been regardless of it, can't break the chain.

Then again, the multiverse theory and the possibilities and the BS arising from it, would slightly put you off for a moment. It seems every one has a gimmick now.

I will rate the other epi of Strange especially the last spider man much much higher."
Inconsistent plot,"The actors were great and that's it. The plot was very chaotic, inconsistent, and it leaves you with the feeling that you are missing something the whole time and in the end you know for sure that you missed 2 hours of your time."
This movie is awesome!,
Really Good Eventually,
Instant Classic!,"I watched this without any expectations and was beyond thrilled! Won't give any spoilers other that this felt a little more DC than Marvel being that it has a bit more of a darker undertone than the Avengers Infinity Arc. Don't pay attention to these bubble gum Marvel fans. For once Marvel came with something original and different knowing that many of the dull, plastic fed fans would probably hate it. I can't wait to see where Marvel will take this story!!"
Must Watched because you will get the answer after watching the movie,
Finally a darker Marvel Movie,This was a great movie and most people didn't like it because they wanted fan service. But if we talk as a movie this one is 10 times better than Spiderman No Way Home. Now I'll talk Spoiler so be careful. !SPOILER WARNING! It was great seeing Wanda super powerful and like terminator which was making a good horror. Even tho I don't like Wanda as a character seeing her as a villian was fun.
Just so bad,
I know I missed a couple Marvel movies prior,"But I do not think seeing them would have helped this AT ALL for me. I truly thought it sucked. And I was really looking forward to seeing it. Had to wait until it was free on streaming. I did not even finish it. My son watched it separately from me, not knowing my opinion, and he had come to the same conclusion. He did not finish it either."
Wanda from Protagonist to Antagonist! SPOILERS,
Scarier than most MCU movies but still good.,"This movie was more violent than other ones in the MCU, someone's neck is snapped, a man's head explodes and someone falls of a tall building onto a sharp fence. The villain was revealed too quickly and i think that we could have gone some more time before their ""mission"" was set up. There is some controversy about if this movie should have been rated R, but it should not have. Most marvel movies are rated PG-13 due to some mild profanities and very little blood. This is the first PG-13 level marvel movie that we have had."
"I like to rename the movie ""Wanda's Misconception"".","First of all, this movie wasn't based on doctor strange. Actually its wanda's movie. And directly connected with wanda-vision. Very disappointed.

After the Endgame, Marvel is losing its entertaining power. Hope for the best in future."
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Mediocrity,
A brilliant new vibe to a Marvel Movie,
It doesn't quite work for me but it might for others,
Too much of the same rubbish,"Yep, same old tripe, just a different movie. Superheroes come up against another ""baddy"" and can't cope. Everything starts to grow pear shaped, Superheroes nearly defeated, then ""hey presto"" Superheroes win. Same stuff just churned out time and time again. Rubbish."
Boring,
Trying too hard to be deep and scary,
Bad like going to exam without preparations,
Brilliant mix of MCU Vs Sam Raimi,"The exact time when the MCU was getting a little monotonous,boom comes Dr Strange 2 with help from Sam Raimi. I was a little skeptical to start with. The reviews were not convincing. After watching it on the big screen my idea was totally changed for good. The problem for the general viewer is unless they have proper knowledge of wandavision,loki,inhumans,shield etc,it will be difficult for put pieces together. Great screenplay,amazing sounds,surprisingly acting was also good & mind blowing CGI for the most part. There were few parts which was like video game from 2015.but it will go unnoticed for regular viewers. I believe the cameos was unnecessary as the movie by itself was strong enough. Im very glad to see this direction taken by the MCU and the opportunity it has developed for the future story lines. Congrats to the whole crew involved in making this master piece of a movie and eagar to see more."
Sad,
"Mixed bag of cool horror and action, but too much recycled ideas and references to previous MCU movies and even tv shows",
Totally underwhelming mess.,"Meh. That's it in a word. Misnamed. Should have been called The Mad Witch and the Multi Mess of Pointlessness. I like Dr. Stranges cloak, that's about it for a positive. I think Marvel have peaked and are now on the slipoery slope to oblivion."
average,
Oh crap. Looks like they finally ruined Doctor Strange.,"I've been a big fan of this character since he first appeared in the MCU, but this was really disappointing. I'm also a big fan of the Scarlet Witch, but they messed her up too. The Marvel Studios didn't stay true to the characters like they were supposed to in the first place. Not only that, but the story felt rushed and jumbled up. I hope Scott Derrickson returns for Doctor Strange 3. It'll be interesting to see how he could clean up this chaotic mess. It would also be great if they act like this movie never happened."
Not sure why they called this Doctor Strange...,"It was the Wanda/Scarlet Witch show. So disappointing, after waiting so long for a new Doctor Strange. And adding America Chavez was about as useless as the character, Rose Tico, in Star Wars. Only there to appeal to a specific demographic, and pretty much unnecessary. Yeah, part of the story, but could have been done in any number of ways that would have been better."
Long way ahead,"I see that MCU want to make this new phase with a different vibes, darker maybe? They still got a lot things to catch up. Compare to all the movie that has been up until this, off course people put a lot of expectation. And this one surely can't meet that i guess.

But for me, this is the first step again. It's quite messy. Idk why they seems in a hurry to build this second phase (ex: eternal) give them a time."
Waste of time,"Coming from an opinion of someone who doesn't catch up with all the marvel movies, I got very bored very quickly! What can I say, I lost the interest...from a story line point of view I probably would have enjoyed this movie a whole lot more if I knew all the backstories of all the characters. From a movie quality I found this movie pretty good, some very well used cgi and for some reason felt super loud - there was this old lady in my cinema and I just felt bad for her the whole way the."
Boring ...,"What more can I say? Same repeated, regurgitated and recycled superhero/-villain crap but now dialed up 100 times. This movies was too predictable. Simply, it's a boring movie."
Boring...,A vulgar and violent approach to the great theory of the multiverse where its total lack of substance and character development is masked behind a hyper inflated budget or CGI...
Messy,The plot and script were really rough. I enjoyed the visuals and the acting was good but the writing was just bad. You can tell they are having trouble holding the MCU together. Lots of plot holes and lazy writing. Hopefully they will put more effort into writing these things or I may be giving up on the MCU in future.
"an absolute delight, and by far the best marvel movie i have ever seen",
Much Ado About Multiverse...,
A bit of a messy plot but AMAZINGLY shot!,
Dr Strange on a dark roller coaster ride,"This movie is like Spider-Man 3, with time, it will prove it's an old wine.

Best thing about this movie is Raimi didnt care about the popularity of other MCU movies and made the way he wants.

Not made for MCU fankids, so don't look into negative reviews, go and enjoy the darkest MCU movie."
You know.. for kids,"My wife and I are watching it right now. I'm 38 and I find it to be very boring and childish. Weak plot, weak dialogue, weak characters all around. Cameos are boring. It feels like a succession of endless boring magic fights. I can't wait for it to be over so we can start watching another episode of Star Trek Strange New Worlds. It's the end sequence right now as I type this and I couldn't care less. Not even paying attention anymore."
Soaked In Politics,Well it was an okay movie besides the politics. I really enjoy Sam Raimi and his work. I have no idea if he had say with some of the politics in the movie but it was obvious where things got political. Why can't they just leave politics out of movies!? I didn't come to see a movie to hear another's political beliefs. I came for pure entertainment. It was a decent movie but the story was pretty dull/plain. A lot of slow parts. Action was good at times but also predictable too. Could of been a much better movie.
Marvel Phase 5 crossroads film.,
Meh.,"Some great CGI and cool 80s trashy horror elements that unfortunately got overshadowed by the lack of plot and lack of character depth.

Overall not the best Marvel experience, the editing was chaotic throughout major parts of the movie and the humor was stale and outdated."
Elizabeth Olsen,"I loved it. I loved Lizzie's performance as The Scarlet Witch, she's so good at showing emotions using her face. I really think she deserves what she's claiming, although she causes horrible things.

I feel like I can understand her reasons and I think thats a very important point to really enjoy the film. I couldn't imagine a better ending for this story, but I really hope it's not the end for her.

I vote for a Scarlet Witch solo movie!!!"
Huge improvement from the first film!,
Batman 2022 is far better than this. Marvel fan be like what!!!!!,"I know it was dark but it should be entertaining. Batman was but it didn't.

I watched this movie in 4Dx and guess what, ending wasn't satisfying. Story has some confusing twists which feels like its lacking some crux in building a concept."
Disappointing. And Disjointed...,
Jeeeeeeez....where do I even start to comment on this absolute mess....,This was an utter disappointment. From start to finish honestly. Very high hopes going in obviously as we all know the first one was pretty great. This was a disaster. I do like that the writers injected a bunch of woke progressive garbage into it though because that's what makes movies better. What a despicable disgrace the left is. Sickening.
Felt like I was scrolling through Tik Tok,"The special effects are obviously outstanding, but it felt like the story suffered because of it.

I felt as if we couldn't sit with moments in the movie and truly grasp them before we were instantly thrown into the next crazy CGI moment."
Unabashedly Raimi - and more.,"Elizabeth Olsen definitely steals the show here - but the show is worthy of her, and all the other actors seem complicit in its emphasis on her performance. My second viewing really made me appreciate Benedict Cumberbatch and his choice to be more subtle as a reflection of Doctor Strange's sadness, but even this makes Olsen feel more formidable. The movie is worth watching for her alone.

Like the new Batman, Multiverse of Madness contains exciting horror elements. Like Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy, his new venture has a touch of whackiness as well that would've been sorely missed had another director managed the project. The action sequences feel dangerous and... well, strange, but there are other fun horror tropes interspersed with the superhero ones. These are necessary anchors as Doctor Strange journeys through impressive alternate realities and meets some other Marvel characters who are given unexpectedly violent treatments.

The Multiverse really is mad, as is the tortured Scarlet Witch. She's scary, her dialogue is scary, and the plot is surprisingly twisted. It still has a lot of heart, and its focus on loneliness certainly has cultural relevance. It's directly emotional but never sappy, and Danny Elfman's great soundtrack never compromises this. I suppose I would've appreciated some more memorable leitmotifs, like the ones he contributed to Tim Burton's Batman duology.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' title still makes sense to me. It still follows the titular character, and it feels comic booky. I could see the title sequence translating to an actual comic book story arc. It's just right for Raimi's style, which I thoght worked extremely well throughout the colorful film, especially given that this has a much faster pace than his Spider-Man films.

I guess that it's tough to market a horror-superhero-action-comedy-drama or whatever you'd call this, and I'm not sure what people were expecting from it. I certainly enjoyed it in all its tragic glory, and I'm grateful that Raimi never compromised his style for the sake of the MCU. I hope he continues to make comic book films - I'm still a fan."
They slaughtered the movie,
Sam Raimi brings old school charms to a complex story and makes it entertaining.,"The Good:

Simplicity and fun manner, in which, the concept of MCU's famed Multiverse was introduced through this movie.

Actors, obviously, Cumberbacth and Olsen were expected to be at their best, but everyone else delivered perfectly well.

The story. This is a good story, that was told well. The plot felt like it moved fast, unlike DC, which allows audience to soak in all the goods bit by bit.

Without going into the spoiler-zone, be prepared to be pleasantly surprised with all the new things you are going to see in the multiverse of Madness.

The Bad:

Humour seemed forced on occasions.

Plot-holes are there, some of them, apparent.

And a lot of opportunities were missed.

This, unlike Spider-man No Way Home, wasn't as well organised and seemed more like a Fan Service."
Marvel's best villain yet,
Better than the last two Marvel movies,"As the subject says it is better than the last 2 Marvel movies but that's not saying a lot. It definitely has its moments but it still is kind of a cookie cutter Marvel movie.

The Good: The story was pretty decent and well paced. What I also like twice that was that with doctor strange having to travel through the multi verse it made him reflect on himself and his choices.

Benedict Cumberbatch did an amazing job as usual. Wong was really good and was his old quirky self. There were some cool surprise characters that I'm sorry happy to see. But no spoilers.

In terms of production value it's a Marvel movie so the production value will be amazing. The editing was good, that camera angles were good, and the special effects were good. Nothing really stood out but nothing was bad.

The bad: I wasn't a big fan of the actress who played America Chavez.

Unfortunately this movie again was just a cookie cutter Marvel movie. I also didn't like that it kind of relied on wandavision for you to fully understand the story.

The Ugly: Benefits Cumberbatch with a ponytail."
A sorcerer fights against a witch..,"...what an unbelievable stupid story this is. They don't have any ideas anymore. Harry Potter has more depth then this movie. It's not enough to fight against a supervillain, no it needs multiverses or gods or witches and sorcerers. The first Dr. Strange was entertaining, cannot remember the 2nd anymore and this is just bad... Wandavision was brilliant but this ruins the character for me."
Yet more Woke crap included,"Movie is ok but why do they have to ruin it with Woke BS?

We are done with that s*it-- just make a friggin movie and leave the politics OUT for once, FFS!!!"
Once Upon a Time Marvel were brilliant.,"What did I watch tonight - re-enacted scenes from the Evil Dead, Dr Strange as a zombie? This seemed more like a cheap horror film than a Marvel movie. I think I deserve a medal for enduring it. The best thing about the cinema tonight was the trailer for the new Avatar film coming out in December. I am going to stick to watching great films like Avengers, Spiderman, Iron Man, Guardians, Antman, Capt America, etc - and not the new ones."
Great visuals.,
Loved it. Raimi weaves his dark style throughout,"Didn't know what to expect going.

But glad I ignored the snobby haters talking garbage.

Really enjoyed the visuals, story and cast. (Hope to get a 3D version to watch again soon).

I didn't really enjoy most of Wandavision. Was daft if original. So the thought if it arrying on in this was worrying.

But it was great seeing Scarlet Witch killing people left right and centre.

Marvel Zombies. Bring on that movie now please.

Benedict is perfect in his role. And is not really settled into the part.

Loads of fun. A visual treat.

Could have been darker as heard was horror ........which it isn't. But certainly more deaths in this and creepier monsters.

The Multiverse opens up so many cool possibilities and seeing different versions was so cool.

Bit of a 'What If?' Coming in. And the thoughts of further exploring these ideas are welcome."
Phase 4 is sacrificing Strange,"I was expecting this movie to answer many burning questions that we've been having since phase 4 and the concept of the multiverse came to be. But instead it left us with more questions.

Also this movie didn't spend as much time as it should, further developing Dr. Strange's character. It more felt like a Scarlet Witch movie than a Dr. Strange movie. I gave it a solid 6 because of some *particular* casting choices and cameos that they done right (although handled the characters kind of poorly) + Elizabeth Olsen's performance and the presence of Raimi's horror signature."
It's More like Time Travel in Multiverse,
Doctor Strange 2,I heavily enjoyed this movie and Sam Ramis side of this story made it much more enjoyable. The visuals are stunning and the plot is great aswell. If you want a good time I'd recommend this film. Just letting you know it's more of a horror movie than it is a superhero one.
It was alright,Impressive CGI and pretty decent plot but it also felt like it was missing something. Or maybe it was trying too hard to achieve something that it ended up underwhelming when compared to the other MCU movies. And overall I wouldn't have minded if I didn't watch it at all.
Boring and waaaay too long,"Maybe one of the worst Marvel movies. So boring, over complicated and too frequent bad acting from the main actors. The plot itself doesn't make any sense. Left before the end, i had already wasted too much of my time."
"Where Spider-Man Misses, This Film Connects!","Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness pulls away from the pack of Marvel films. It's cinematography, scoring, and world building make it essential viewing for any comic fan and moviegoer who enjoys out-of-this-world experiences. Do not go into this movie expecting it to spell everything out for you though, as it relies heavily on previously established storylines. As Marvel crafts an even larger universe of its own, it's clear that fans will need to keep up with all of its content in order to understand the larger themes and layered characters that are explored. If that is a problem for you, do not expect to enjoy this movie. Personally, I loved the way the events of WandaVision were tied in. Elizabeth Olsen was excellent in her role. My biggest fear going in was that this would end up being a movie primarily about Wanda however, to my surprise, this movie added stunning layers to Benedict Cumberbatch's Stephen Strange. The way the two characters evolve and how their stories intertwined were executed masterfully. The film's major theme eventually becomes introspection and by the end, the film's greatest triumph is the growth of its characters as they navigate this fantastic, at times psychedelic new world. It truly felt like a major MCU movie with major reveals and plot twists. Sam Rami's horror elements added something unique and essential. Danny Elfman's soundtrack was stunning and set the tone throughout the entire film. My second favorite Marvel film of all time right behind Shang-Chi. I can't wait to go see it again!"
Amazing,"Unbelievable how much I didn't notice by seeing the trailer and after the movie... They made the plot so perfectly and unexpected that even in this chaotic trailer I missed so many details that I realized only after watching the movie.

Unlike no way home which was extreme plot dissapointment yet great actors - this one contains awesome story and twists and the best actors in town right now

Great CGI and animations work which is so special to Strange's movies and so pleasing and different.

Highly recommended!

Only 1 bad thing to say is America's acting which was absolutely childish and reminded me overacting 2003 Disney's shows characters."
Breath of Fresh (But Definitely Dark) Air,"My new favorite Marvel movie.

Definitely darker this time - more for an adult audience - so parents with younger kids be advised (13+ you should be fine). But that's what I loved about the film, it explored new areas and perspectives within the marvel universe and had a lot of fun along the way.

If you enjoy scary movies in the slightest, youll love this film and appreciate Sam Raimis approach."
"Don't go breakin' my art, baby! I couldn't if I tried...maybe","It breaks my heart to write this review and rate a film in a franchise I admire so low, but I suppose my truth will set me free! Maybe I was in the wrong mood, or a rewatch may change my mind, but as the credits rolled the sinking feeling I had since about 20 minutes into the film did not abate! Or, maybe I expected too much!?

In this film Dr Strange meets a myriad of superpowered people that already have their own streaming series or will soon be in one. Inhumans and Fantastic Four are the only names I'll drop for now!

That being said, you didn't have to watch any of the extended universe content to understand the flashes where they cameoed, as even Strange's lack of knowledge carried him through the thin story, anyway!

Neither an origin story nor a sequel to a previous storyline, this film is pure exposition. A lesson in multiple dimensions, universes, or story threads, if you will. Although many geek-centered anomalies and surprises, for the most part felt like the teacher, played by Harrison Ford, at the start of Goonies! Not as bad as Ferris Buellars's role call Professor, but somewhere in between. And speaking of, the chemistry between the master and apprentice was pure comedy, when they had a fraction of a teleporting millisecond to spare!

A long-winded montage of what causes, defines, and constrains a multiverse much like Lucy and Limitless' shorthand views of mankind's history or evolution. Just more talked about and refracted than necessary, taking away momentum of what's to be a long, complex storyline. Specially with the post-credit introduction! Dum, dum, dum!"
An Action Movie Disguised as a Magic Film,
Glad i wasn't in theater,
Most bold and risk taking MCU film yet,"Multiverse of Madness, while still struggling with cliché tropes and sometimes cringey dialogue, is without a doubt the most unique of the MCU films so far. Fans of Sam Raimi and the Evil Dead series like myself should be especially satisfied with the countless twists and turns, horror jump scares, and the surprising amount of brutally dark moments the PG-13 limit is able to allow. All of this in addition to a likable(and notably inconsequential)story and exciting new characters and places make it one of the most original, refreshing, and exciting entries in the MCU."
Entertaining,First of all story of this movie is simple and plain and to understand this movie story you have to watch wanda vision web series first But the way they showed multiverse was interesting and vfx shots were amazing and treat to watch i expected many cameos in this movie but unfortunately none of them happened But the movie was really fun to watch and the ending was amazing i liked this movie because of the concept they really explored the multiverse more than Spiderman nwh in this movie to be honest i liked this movie more then spider man nwh It's just my opinion.
I thought it was great fun!,"This was one of my favourite films in the MCU. Some totally unique and creative things going on, and I really liked the more horror theme to it. It didn't feel slow at all, was action packed from the start.

The one thing I didn't like was why call one of the characters America? Out of every possible name they could have gone for, they picked a name which kept confusing me... ""We need to find America"" etc etc."
"the classic Sam Raimi bits are fun, the rest is just forgettable",
Glad I did not watch this in the theater,7.1 is a very generous rating for this film. The whole movie has no point. Stupid action with no plot. Over the Scarlet Witch after this one. She brings nothing to the Marvel Universe imo. This movie was purely a money grab. I hope they don't make another Dr. Strange. On the other hand can't wait to watch the new Thor movie.
I wish I loved it...,
Wonderful,
I think this film is overly hated.....,"It has its moments where it shines. But man the things wrong with it really shine in your face. I won't spoil it, but this film has some surprises of course. And all though they are cool it also has quite a lot of problems as well. This film is pretty much for every good thing, there is a bad or dumb thing. But Sam Raimi was perfect for directing this. I think he did great, but the writer really screwed up the film. So overall, this is a fun ambitious film with a real dark feel of it. But there are very noticeable problems that hold back its true potential."
Good but not great,
I had enough,These movies are starting to get old and predictable. I did not enjoyed this enough like the past tons of films. The MCU needs a break and I need a break either.
"Some Multiverse, No Madness",
"A well paced crazy Doctor strange rollercoaster, with some slightly diversive character directions",
A big step down,"Visually appealing and star studded as usual, but I really don't like watching characters put in movies just to showcase a real world agenda. Some of them are pointless and I see this becoming a trend in Marvel movies nowadays.

Not a good story, which could have taken Sam Raimi's direction to a whole new level. I really wish I'd saved my money👎🏻"
"The Good is Really Good, But the Bad Can Get Pretty Bad",
One of Marvel's best,"Wow, everything I could have hoped for in a Raimi-directed Dr. Strange was here and more. The beautiful visuals, the suspense, the way he directs actors, it all came together to make an experience that is unique in the Marvel universe.

Every scene had me wondering where they could go next, and it surprised me at every turn. Adding a big dose of horror to the world of Strange certainly was a great idea, too.

The writing was simply great, and unlike many Marvel films the action pieces were well integrated into the overall plot, often contributing to the character's arcs instead of just being excuses for punching and zapping, as can often happen in a film of this genre.

To say this exceeded what I hoped for is an understatement. Very highly recommended."
Amazing,"It was absolutely amazing, of course there's people complaining about not enough multiverse and I understand because we would love to see everything there is to it but what they did show us was amazing. Will be watching a 2nd time."
Overall amazing movie!,"This has to be one of my favorite marvel movies, the acting was surperb Elizabeth Olsen really stole the show in my opinion. The effects were phenomenal as I would expect from a marvel movie, something else that I really enjoyed from this movie was the horror aspect it wasn't exactly scary or anything It just had some chilling moments which you don't really see in a MCU movie. Overall I'd highly recommend this movie!"
Awful!,"I started to walk out around 10 minutes in, and ended up staying to my regret. The sound effects were very poor. The CGI was poor. The dialogue was beyond bad. The acting was sub par, and whoever that was that played ""America"" was some of the worst acting I've seen on a marvel set yet.

Some fight scenes were tolerable; ones that didn't involve CGI. Some jokes were OK.

Save your money. Wait to stream it and see for yourself."
Congratulations Raimi,"Since the begining of the movie, I was trying to think what was going to happen, but it literally. Exceeded my expectations, nothing that I thought actually happened, the structure of the film is pretty solid, Wanda's motivations were actually fine to me, America Chavez might be one of the best things in the movie, but still, the best thing in every Sam Raimi movie, Sam Raimi himself made a perfect, solid, and well done movie, for me, everything fits on each place it should, congrats Raimi, you made it again."
WOW- Multiverse of Madness is...,"GENERAL THOUGHTS: Last Night, I saw Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and my god- Sam Raimi can really direct a horror film, even if the rating is still PG-13! But, do not let that rating fool you, it has some really intense, violent and gruesome scenes that made the experience so much better! And just to let you know, this film is NOT a Cameo After Cameo Movie, but the surprises it does have, are enough for me, as it spent the other amount of time building the story, BUT I wish the film was longer! It was really short to take all this Madness in, and maybe could've sprinkled in a few more Universes if the runtime let it. The Overall story is simple and easy to follow, and that title suits the movie really perfectly, as it is MADNESS! It's probably one of the darkest Comic-Book-Movies of all time, and the visuals are stunning! It's a little messy when it gets into the whole Multiverse thing in the middle, but it has such creative ideas and scenes, that makes it so damn entertaining!

ACTING: Benedict Cumberbatch as Strange was amazing, and just seeing his character shine in his own solo movie again is great, and in my opinion, Wanda wasn't taking any spotlight away from Strange! Xochitil Gomez as America Chavez was such a awesome addition to the story! Her character is what pretty much the entire movie revolves around, and I loved her personality and energy throughout the movie, and her character was emotional when it needed to be, but now, LET'S GET TO ELIZABETH OLSEN AS THE SCARLET WITCH! My God, she is a true villain in the movie! The performance she has is just.. WOW. And the supporting characters, like Wong and Mordo were great too!"
Horror in a Marvel movie!,"The films start and end somewhat like many other films but the middle part of this movie is a true gem. When Wanda unleash herself and act like the Nemesis or Mister X from Resident Evil, i was on the edge of my seat gasping for air, it was insanely good. The new character America Chavez is a tad boring, mostly a damsel in distress and like many other movie get a positive word at the end and steal the ending. She could be a good character, she just didnt do much in this movie. Seriously as much as i love Benedict and think hes a damn good actor, Ms Olsen stole the show in this movie."
Not such a strange Doctor I was waiting for...,"The advertising campaign and various conversations about the new film about Doctor Strange were going hard. However, after the cancellation of the release in Russia, there were no fewer YouTube videos from bloggers. It seemed that the project would be worthwhile. The expectation was especially great after the very successful ""Spider-Man 3"". But it is quite possible that high expectations played a cruel joke on me. Frankly speaking, I didn't like the film.

The plot offers the viewer a confrontation between Stephen Strange and Wanda Maximoff, who wants to find her children who do not exist in her world in parallel dimensions. To fully understand the whole tragedy of the Scarlet Witch, it is necessary to see her solo series, which was released a year earlier. But even knowing about the story of a young girl, it is impossible to get into the current drama to the end. Wanda has suffered quite a few losses in her life, including Mercury and Vision, and then this complicated story with the whole town and her children. In the finale of ""Wanda/ Vision"", at least it was clear that the girl's psyche was so broken, what a tragedy it was for her to lose everything and, in fact, to be left alone with this problem. In the same film, we see the consequences of how dangerous the situation can be, first of all, for the person himself, who was left without support with his losses. However, the serial strong line of Wanda's intrapersonal problems in the ""Multiverse of Madness"" is fading. She doesn't have that strength, and I, as a spectator, simply don't believe the girl and her trouble, although I can even imagine what it's like for her. But I don't have to imagine and think. Experienced screenwriters and director Sam Raimi had to twist this nerve so that no one would have any doubts - Wanda is suffering and going crazy with grief.

As a result, in the film about Doctor Strange, I mostly saw the story of the Scarlet Witch. This is a mistake, because there was a bias in their joint history. On the other hand, the complicated history of the relationship between Stephen and his long-time lover Christina Palmer, who is going to marry another, absolutely passes by. Again, it feels like they want to show us the difficult experiences of Strange, but this is done in a hurry and badly twisted. As a result, you conclude that the creators of the film were in a hurry somewhere. You bet. The film seems to have been remade, sent for reshoots, shortened such a large-scale project to two hours on the screen. And all this is felt: the ragged rhythm of the narrative, the weak elaboration of the characters. But Raimi was happy to disperse in his horror themes, which were well represented here to the extent that the rating of the film and the philosophy of the film comic as a whole allowed. In a couple of moments it was really creepy. Hardly anyone missed the second when the deadly Wanda looked straight into their eyes, as if punching through our universe.

The audience was very much waiting for some of the heroes. What was their surprise and disappointment when, in fact, it turned out to be just a cameo, and even with such a plot development, when you don't have time to really get acquainted with the characters yet, and they are already leaving the narrative, because you should return to the main storyline. It is clear that this was done specifically for fans, but you need to focus on the entire audience of the film.

The film, of course, came out colorful, but fast. The multiverse, in my opinion, was little disclosed. So many worlds have been presented here, but we have not stopped at least a few to show how they differ from what we are used to. It is clear that this could not be the goal, but the presented material was clearly not enough.

Some scenes and dialogues look frankly weak or even strange. ""Musical fight"" made me think a couple of times, but I'm definitely not watching some kind of fake. It's just that Marvel's decision wasn't like them at all. Even if such a fight, like it was in the comics, seemed frankly unnecessary to me in the movie.

The film is generally not bad. But I was disappointed. I was waiting for a much larger project with a clear confrontation and more competently written characters. In the end, the story did not impress, remaining somewhere on the sidelines in front of the visual. But as you know, in the modern world, you can't go out on special effects and a beautiful picture alone. We have long been accustomed to the modern possibilities of graphics and drawn worlds. History itself should prevail after all. But it's definitely worth noting that the artists of the painting did their best, showing the audience amazing fantastic locations that they really wanted to explore. Who knows. Maybe Marvel will lead us to this one day, showing in some hypothetical ""Avengers 5"" a whole multiverse war, where different worlds will be revealed much better.

6 out of 10."
Wanda maximoff,
Marvel team-up Doctor Strange and America Chavez,
What if it was longer?,"With little longer run time this movie could have been way better. Plus, forced comedy didnt help this movie. I personally like they were trying break so called marvel formula. Anyway. Its a fun voilent and little bit spooky movie.....Waiting for how The flash will handle its multiversal concept.."
Seriously are you happy?,"Ohh meh this was another line up in The marvel universe that keeps expanding,nor the less we miss you scarlet witch, but seriously there are like a thousand men out there including me that can give you a family y go through all that, it's infuriating when i think about it, you denied your self to a robot,i don't understand women with supernatural powers, you say it's the magic but I know of only 1 magic and u do 2, the one of creation pls next time let the incursion not be that severe you need a man. Can't wait 4 your return d.strange."
Cinematography Master piece.,"I liked everybit of the movie.

Sam Raimi just nailed it.

The new options are now opened for MCU, as per the audience reaction we were not so much hyped. But i'll allow it.

So, the visuals are damn awesome you will love and story was okok. Doctor strange didn't play a bigger role as previous one, this movie is like a whole.

Characters have done a amazing job.

So just enjoy it."
Great movie even if your don't know anything about marvel,"So i went to see this movie with my sister because she's a big marvel fan, not me on the other hand i never watched all the marvel movies some i did but with her, it's not that I hate marvel but it's nothing for me, i watched this movie in 4DX and it was great it was fun movie, the story was good and the acting was really good the special effects was great, i didn't understand some things but my sister explained it all."
More like Wandavision part 2,Doctor Strange as a character was irrelevant in the movie. They used several cameo (or modified cameo) characters only to have them be useless and inept. Poorly written and poorly executed.
I was left in my seat feeling disappointed,
W,"While this film has a more grim tone than its predecessors it's still a Marvel film at heart. Of course it would take Sam Raimi to find the perfect blend of comic-book-movie, horror, fantasy and slapstick. He might be working with a massive budget now, but the man stays true to his roots and sticking with what he knows pays off.

The pacing may seem disjointed or fragmented at times, but I feel that only reflects the complex nature of the multiverse within the film. Maybe it's not like other groundbreaking MCU films, but ultimately this is an entertaining feature."
Really entertaining Sam Raimi movie,"I haven't seen many Marvel/DC movies and even missed the first dr strange movie but this was a very fun movie to me with great pacing, top-notch acting and satisfying storytelling. Sorta stupid and cheesy but really entertaining and even creative. In short: a Sam Raimi movie.

Also should mention the amazing visuals and epic music. Sound effects were also incredible. But again I'm a Sam Raimi fan so take this review with a pinch of salt."
Something is not quite right.,"As a Marvel fan, and a general film fanatic, I was sure to keep my mind open going into this film. But I just felt like something was off. I was completely ready for the Sam Raimi cheese, and I tried not to have an opinion as the only films I have seen by him (other than the Spiderman trilogy of course) are Evil Dead and Drag me to Hell, the latter of which was laughably bad. Unfortunately there were many moments, especially towards the end of this film that reminded me of Drag me to Hell... I'm not going to spoil anything for you, but I will say, Elizabeth Olsen is STUNNING as The Scarlet Witch, and even though you could technically watch it without having seen Wandavision, I think that it is 100% worth watching before this film as I imagine it would have even more plot holes without. Overall, this movie was messy, cheesy and very very strange. But at least it was kind of fun, right?"
Multiverses,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a 2022 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics. The film was directed by Sam Raimi 🌌

It's good 🙂 I'd recommend it if you like this genre 👍🏼

ENTER A NEW DIMENSION OF STRANGE."
What did I just watch?,
The multiverse is just an excuse for randomness,"I don't like where Marvel is headed, of course this is Disney's cash cow now so it will be impossible for them to stop making Marvel titles, enough will never be enough but it can't go on forever without compromising quality.

I had to wrap my brain around the movie, I wouldn't call it madness but rather randomness.. this Marvel stage can easily be ""Phase: Whatever the hell we want""! The multiverse brings an infinite amount of possibilities both good and well what this movie was... I do have one good thing to mention before the mess, the special effects were spot on, and I am saying this because a lot of the latest big budget Marvel movies had awful CGI but at least they got that part right on this one.

The plot is just simply not good, for one thing it's very rushed and it doesn't feel like a Doctor Strange or even a Marvel movie at all to be honest. The monsters, dimensions and powers (aside from the stuff we've seen in previous films) are generic, basic and most of them inexplicable, I get it, it's the Multiverse and anything goes there are no rules, but the feeling I got is that this is being used as an excuse for lazy writing.

Without giving much spoilers the villain (although it was set up before) doesn't convince me and became too dark to quickly, the cameos were pointless and their only purpose was fan service, and the finale setting up a continuation for this mess was the final cherry on top of the bad.

It's a messy movie ironically with a basic plot, I felt detached from familiar characters and the future is not promising at all, again they will never drop such a profitable project but things have their time and I am afraid quality will continue to drop."
"I don't know how to feel - Sam Raimi you need, and must, read more marvel comic books",
"Filled with sound and fury, signifying nothing.",Too much visual and mental clutter. I don't plan on watching further Dr. Strange films. The convolutions and the ridiculously over-the-top CG simply wear me out.
I don't get why all the hate The Movie was far from boring !,
Okay,Doctor strange in the multiverse of madness is a pretty good movie with lots of amazing moments. It has its up and downs some are good some not so. I like the characters and the story but it feels to fast.
Raimi Thrill-Ride,"Sam Raimi brings his distinct directing style to this multiversal thrill-ride. The cameos were very fun. Danny Elfman showed that he can still make an excellent, ORIGINAL score. Story is somewhat simple. Wanda was terrifying as the villain. This movie blew me away!"
"Could've been better, but still enjoyable....","I saw this film twice this weekend both in 3D. Once in IMAX and the other in Ultra AVX. Both times I was blown away. While it's not nearly as great as ""No Way Home"" it still gives a lot to look forward to. In my books it equals ""Doctor Strange"" (2016) in terms of rating 81 (2016) v 82 (2022).

Hard to write and not spoil, but the expanded idea of the multiverse is fascinating bringing in other realities that you would figure exist if there was only a singular verse, but it doesn't because of conflicting backgrounds. (If you've seen the film hopefully that makes sense)

The acting was terrific by the experienced Benedict Cumberbatch, great by the getting there Elizabeth Olson, and alright by newcomer Xochitl Gomez. I believe she'll come into her being the more she plays America Chavez, but her performance was good enough that I look forward to seeing her again in the role.

The cinematography, and especially the score, we're insane. Absolutely chaotic, but enhanced the senses in ways that some MCU films fail to capture. Some of the camera shots within the other dimensions were stomach churning, or headache giving, as they went in circles. However, can't complain too much.

Perhaps the biggest negative is how quickly certain things took place. There wasn't much build up to the villain and the end scenes felt unnecessarily rushed. A three hour movie with relevant scenes would've been more appropriate than the two hour movie it was, crunched together.

Overall, it was an excellent movie. I'd recommend checking it out in IMAX if you can. The score was incredible. Expansion of the multiverse was pretty incredible to see, but could've been more in-depth.

Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps you make a decision on the film. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!"
A movie you should watch in the cinema,"The movie is 8/10 but as a magic fan, I think it deserves 9/10. If you like magic, I highly recommend watching it. I'm glad they finally put the effort into this character. I'm looking forward to the next movie.

The only problem is that we don't see enough of the multiverse. But it's not that big of a problem."
Dr strange and dora the explorer,
Dr. CGI and the Mommyverse of Morons,"I avoided trailers on this one to save any spoils, but I assure you, nothing would be lost missing this one. This is, by a large margin, the worst Marvel movie in the last 2 decades. The opening scene alone is cringe worthy enough to claw your eyes out, and it goes further downhill from there. The writers should be fired, the costume designers should be fired, Cumberbun's wig should be fired.

The plot line is beyond idiotic, every line is forced cheese, acting is almost unbearable, multi-verse set design is predictable, and worst of all, it is far too long.

It seems in this one Dr. Strange went from Jafar to Evil Genie with limitless powers ... so that's lame.

I read somewhere that this had a horror feel to it, I think they meant to say horrIBLE feel to it. It was by no stretch of the imagination scary, thrilling, or jumpy. The few scenes that could have been, were interrupted with a stupid joke, silly comment, or dumb laughing skull.

Honestly, giving this a 2 is a stretch."
REFRESHING! Raimi and Elfman did it again!,"I was skeptical about America Chavez perhaps taking some glory away from Strange in a well deserved sequel. However that was not the case. Steven was indeed the main STAR. . See what I did there. This was a brilliant, dark and refreshing addition to the MCU. A few cheesy moments but overall an exhilarating ride from start to finish. Keep in mind folks not every Marvel film can be on the level of Endgame and No Way Home. Don't compare. Just enjoy."
I loved it,"I thought the pace of the movie was good. It kept me entertained the whole time. Those with some prior knowledge of MCU, especially some of the newer shows and movies exploring the multiverse (eg. Wandavision, Spider-Man: No way home, Loki) will probably be able to understand the story better. I would also manage expectations for cameos. If you keep an open mind though and allow yourself to just enjoy the movie, you won't be disappointed."
Didn't live up to its name.,
One of the best phase four movies.,
Its a doctor strange movie ...,"The movie is not bad and not legendary the movie is good or very good, people are going to the movie just for cameos and they didn't watch what they are supposed to watch and of course they won't like it cause they are going for cameos, at the end its a doctor strange movie not a multiverse movie, basically this movie is good but people went crazy waiting for cameos, there were enough in a doctor strange movie but of course not a multiverse movie, if you are going to the movie go the mindset of watching a doctor strange movie not cameos movie and you will like it."
Fun AF!!!,"It wasn't made to be the best film but it was certainly made to be as fun as possible to watch. The amount of creativity and ideas that went into this is incredible. It is a little satirical, a little scary and very very exciting. America was a little too childish but still a good character. The story is an important one in the MCU. Very much worth to watch!!!"
Cartoonish,"I could actually deal with the fact that this movie is overwhelmingly cartoonist, but the story is just... bad. Nevermind that we just have to accept that an Avenger went evil without any setup, but I have no feelings for any of these characters. The movie fails to make me connect. A new teenage character has 2 Moms. This one is just rotten."
the worst mcu film to date,
Pure Comic Book Perfection,"Several times now, Marvel Studios have taken concepts that, at a time, seemed far too ""out there"" & ""comic book-y"" to be put to film, and brought those concepts to life in ways that have made hardcore fans say ""I can't believe this film exists"". The Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, Spider-Man: No Way Home, and, now Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness. Marvel have once again crafted something that I can't believe exists as a mainstream blockbuster. This film is so unbelievably ""comic book-y"" and, like with The Batman, one of the best things about this film is that it's not for everyone; it doesn't go out of it's way to be as widely palatable as possible to cater to casual moviegoers. Rather, this film sticks firmly to the outlandish concepts that it presents and never feels ashamed of wholly embracing the fact that it's is a comic adaptation. Even better, the story itself is gripping even without all of the immensely satisfying inclusions. All of those fun surprises are just frosting on top of an already well-baked cake! However, with all of the madness and grand ideas, this film never loses sight of the fact that it is, primarily, a Doctor Strange story, and manages to serve the character terrifically! It is everything you could ever want from a Doctor Strange flick (and everything I DID want from the first one)! The film remains tonally consistent, and said tone feels fresh within this genre. Sam Raimi proves that he is still the king of this genre, providing truly impeccable direction. Michael Waldron's script is gripping, heartfelt, and wildly exciting. Danny Elfman provides some of his best work EVER (which is saying something)! Every actor brings their A-Game. The visuals are gorgeous, which is refreshing in an era of poor CGI. The creativity displayed in certain set-pieces in truly breathtaking. All in all, Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness is the kind of film that I just can't quite believe exists and I absolutely DO NOT have enough good things to say about it. 10/10."
Nonsensical gibberish in a not-so pretty package.,"If this were a Rorschach test, I saw two possibilities: 1) Chunks of vomit on a wall 2) Diarrhea dripping off a canvas. The story was chaotic absurdity, the visuals psychedelic nonsense and the dialogue rambling gibberish. The movie lacked Iron Man's artful magnetism, Spiderman's innocent charm and The Guardians of the Galaxy's witty repartee. It was all tedious plot, with no lovable character development."
Another visually stunning Marvel superhero blockbuster with a childish yet convoluted script (that genre fans will love),"Marvel's latest epic ""Dr Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness"" is of course spectacular, with a strong cast (inc Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen (always great), Rachel McAdams, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong and cameos from the likes of Charlize Theron, Patrick Stewart & John Krasinski) and the REAL star: iconic director Sam Raimi whose first film in almost a decade is a stunning visual powerhouse. Typical too tho of superhero movies is the rather childish yet convoluted script (from Michael Waldron) that genre nerds will LOVE (with it's call backs etc) but most others may be bemused by (while they're still being blown away by Raimi's visuals)."
Not the greatest sequel.,"I like Raimi. This was not a good vehicle for him. It seemed out of place among the MCU, as if it was not using the same sense of framing and composition. Xochitl Gomez was, well, not terrible."
A bit of a mess,
The final nail,"Let this chaotic and awful movie be the final nail in Marvels coffin. They have officially lost their touch.

The movie is rushed without any power to the plot. Horrible casting and straight up embarrasing acting."
Entertaining enough,"This is a classic Marvel movie, entertaining but not thoroughly deep. There are several negative reviews here, but I think those viewers expect too much. Yes, some character motivations make little sense & the plot felt rushed, but the visuals were mostly great & the music fitted in well. At the end of the day this is a Marvel movie, its a cookie cutter formula thats been used before & its no different to 'pop' music.. it has been manufactured to make money, so looking for deeper meanings is a waste of time, just sit back & enjoy it for what is, a couple of hours of casual entertainment. I will say, Sam Raimi's original elements were a great addition to Marvel."
Not. Doc Strange Movie - more bad Wandavision 2,"Not sure why they have destroyed Wanda. Endgame didn't destroy the Avengers, this movie did. Horrific writing and horrid editing. It is weird to see Marvel making bad DC movies. Doc Strange was of my favorite characters and here he is just a dumb butt of jokes. So sad. And Sam Raimi, what happened to him?"
WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO DR. STRANGE 2 // LET DOWN,"I love the first Dr. Strange film, and of course the character appears in other Marvel films a few times. Now we have a Sequel that is all for Dr. Strange, and again with the wonderful Benedict Cumberbatch.

What a disappointment this film is! It's a good thing that Benedict is in great shape physically because he spends most of the movie running around, and very little time acting!

** A moment of Light in this awful mess of a movie, is when Patrick Stewart appears .... what a thrill! The elder Thespian just commands the screen, and every word and facial expression is everything this movie SHOULD have been! Sadly, he is gone too soon!

** Was there a story?? If there was, it was hard to find !! A lot of Sound and Fury amounting to very little !!!"
Great movie that continues really well from Spider-Man No Way Home,"I loved this movie with the villain of the film being revealed very early on, which is a step away from the previous films. There were quite a few twists and turns in the movie that keeps the audience both entertained and engaged. There were some scenes that dragged out a little to much. Overall, in my view, this is the next best film in the marvel franchise after Infinity Wars and End Game."
sum,"I was absolutely drawn into the plot from the first second to the last - Amazing soundtrack and sounds, story, action, funny - thx great work Marvel ! :-D

SCORE 10/10."
The same Evil Dead but for Marvel,"The film is a copy of all the Reimi's movies... the book, the demon, the possessed girl. And in the beginning the visual effects are not the best.

For me Sam Reimi is not a good option for Marvel.

However, I like that is a horror movie."
Dr. Strange 2 can only be watched for its soundtrack!,"Danny Elfman's work is Danny Elfman, so his amazing impact on the film comes as no surprise. From the music that plays before the characters enter the stage and the orchestral music that is specific to the Sami Remy theme and style to the superhero battle (yes you read that right!), The soundtrack of this film is an extraordinary album composed by novice composers and Professionals can use it as a model for their work. In fact, Dr. Strange 2 can only be watched for its soundtrack!

The result of Sami Remy's first appearance in Marvel's cinematic world is certainly not a perfect film, but it has a new theme and atmosphere that other directors have already established, and we'd love to see that style again. The hustle and bustle is right for Dr. Strange, but hopefully the next title script will have fewer holes. We are not going to reveal the story and spoil it, but we can boldly say that some of the film's dialogues are similar to the waterfalls of the waterfall film Moonfall (maybe only 15-16 people have seen Moonfall and this comparison is not appropriate, but the same few They understand what we are saying!). When talents like Olsen, Cumberbatch and McAdams in the film can not cope with the ridiculous dialogue of the script, it is as if the script must be reviewed once or twice."
Multiverse off madness,This movie was good I just made a big mistake and that is that I walked in there expecting no way home and I should not have done that cause it made the movie a bit disappointing to me.but else I think it was good I just wasn't a big fan of the ending.
DONT WASTE YOUR TIME,We paid 30 bucks for the movie and walked out after 30 minutes. Was the worst movie of the century! Benedict Cumberbatch is a great actor but I am hard pressed to see why he approved this script.
Don't hope for much cameos,
Best part was wanda,
Okay,"Great soundtrack. Lots of jumpscares in which most are cheap. America Chavez is the best character here. Martha moment. Great adventure, underwhelming ending."
Huge let down,"First Dr Strange is, for me, the best movie on the MCU. This... this is not the worst, but close. And, honestly, I feel it's pretty much Sam Raimi's fault that didn't want to serve the story but the movie to serve him and use all his mannerisms, weirdness and silly jokes without caring if it matches Dr Strange."
Warning,
Not the best MCU work,"Two words - Strange mayhem!

I am missing the punch and the storytelling that we used to have in MCU phase 3.

It's just too fast, too much action and missing story and making even less sense as to what and where the movie is going...

Some scenes were not suitable for kids as they were typic Sam Raimi signature violence depictions or felt like non MCU material."
Completely disappointed and couldn't even finish it,
A bit... Disappointed,"There was A LOT going on and it was very messy and just unnecessary. I don't regret having watched it but it is not even close to being my favorite mcu movie. 3,5/10."
Somewhat wasted potential...,"Now it was a different, which I can appreciate, but it missed the mark for me. I have never seen anything by the Director so maybe I just wasn't ready for this and misunderstood the direction they took but to my credit the trailers I saw showed a very different movie...there were some good ideas and fun moments but overall I was not feeling it. Bad pacing, horrible character/motive development (yes, I've seen WandaVision, which I loved, and I still think it was not good), so-so writing, cheesy moments that did not feel right and a lot of jokes that fell flat... As one person said in their review... in another universe there is a better version of this movie. Which is too bad, I was looking forward to this one."
"well this was a movie alright,,,","Editing.. bad. Weird transitions.. took me right out of the movie.

Soundtrack choices very confusing? Why is there random electric guitar in the middle of a serious moment..

Very cheesy one liners.. in the style of terminator.. ''i can do this all day'' '' go to hell'' while shooting a fire cannon at a demon.. i mean come on..

tried to be 4 genres but failed to be even one.

Rushed story , and a weak one at that.. alot of plotholes and easily avoided situations.

There where some good moments but quickly followed by silly garbage

Why are magicians using bows and cannons?

Random minotaur showing up and dying in 2 seconds? Just needed some trailer fodder?'

very disappointed that this come from marvel...

Did not have any expectations but they did not even meet that.. being generous to give it a 4."
The Multiverse Isn't So Much Madness At Much As At Is Murderous,"Streamers do not get me wrong by the title... the movie is madness alright but it's just that much more murderous! Welcome back and to the long-awaited review for Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. You've got it this weekend Dr. Strange 2 was finally released and MCU fans can finally let a sigh of relief taht the MCU Phases are still coming hot and fresh and all new tricks.

My biggest issue with the movie is that it glosses over the connection to No Way Home. It felt as if that was no significant or consequential time in the MCU. I mean Dr. Strange is pompous and flippant but it felt sooooooo ... idk. And quite early in the movie he makes a decision that just seems so careless and devil may care attitude. It felt a bit weird. Other than that I felt the movie moved a bit too fast but I do appreciate the under 2 hour runtime. Under two hours and it felt like things were just moving so quickly. Almost feels like you missed something and have to see it again. Quite refreshing i must admit and I do plan on seeing this again in short order. But let's get to the good.

The movie is wild. The qualify this as madness and it was but it was even more so murderous. I mean from the trailer you can see how everything is literally unraveling on the screen, but the full movie takes it up a notch. The thing I'm most pleased by is that the trailer seems to show so much but the movie has so much more left in the tank. I was quite frightened this was just going to be What If come to live action. And while this movie definitely, touches What if tones, they are not derivative. I should've had more faith in Sam Raimi, Disney and Kevin Feige that they wouldn't let us down. On top of that, the cast doesn't let us down either. Benedict is all over and manages to keep his head straight. Elizabeth Olsen continues her great performance from WandaVision and really doubles down on the mad in this one. The newcomer who plays America Gomez, doesn't add much but let's see what we get from her character in the future. And all of the extra cast play their roles to a T. Was it all perfect? No. The directors or editors might have missed or should've used other takes but interestingly enough that makes me want to see the deleted scenes from this movie. They definitely whittled this movie down to be what it was which makes me think what crazy things didn't make the cut.

All in all, I couldn't imagine seeing Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness not on a big screen. The MCU put a ton of money, effort, and thought into the effects, cast, fanfare, etc. For this movie. Is it perfect? No. Will you be severely entertained and possibly grossed out or scared? Yes. You're left thinking how and when does this fit io the bigger universe and what's next! Grab a big box of popcorn and chow down as you enjoy this mad dash through the multiverse and MCU."
Heading into mediocrity,Slow and steady wins the race. In this case the race to mediocrity. I watched this purely cause I had nothing to watch. Nothing memorable. Also I've not bothered to watch Wandavision and realised that this marvel universe thing is now getting tiring. Watch if you're a hard core fan. Else expect nothing great.
Wanda Vision Multiverse,
Story line?,"I admit i dont like the new era of marvel movies but looking at this objectively makes the story line of this movie pretty bad. I liked the first dr strange as it had a straight forward storyline with realistic outcomes (eceb for a superhero movie).

This movies storyline is really bad. Theres so many unecessary scenes that simply shouldnt be in the movie (hence the 2 hours). On multiple occasions the main characters were stuck and wouldnt know how to continue but then they mysteriously find another way. This unironically happened at least 4 times. For example they had to get into a specific location that nobody had survived the journey to. They simply just teleport to said location. For every problem there was a simple solution. Writing it like that there shouldnt have been a problem in the first place due to there being multiple ways to avoid the main conflict in the movie. They also had to much fun with the muliwerse killing off a high amount of superheroes in 2 minutes. Why? Well because theres infinite superheroes to kill and revive now i guess.

All the stars i gave were for cgi."
When the special effects beat the plot logic,"Simply, the entire story is written by a 7 years old who has good friends managing the special effects. Stan Lee is rolling in his grave because of this stupidity presented as a Marvel film. So sad and dissapointed."
I was really hoping for a nice mediocre superhero movie,"I don't know where to start. Everything in this movie was chaotic. The plot was thrusted on you and spelled out in cheesy dialog in the first 10 minutes. The characters were undeveloped and one-dimensional and I did not care about any of them the whole movie (and I really liked both Dr Strange and Wanda in other movies they have been in). I'm usually easily pleased with a cliche mediocre superhero movie, but this was unwatchable."
Jim from the office gets turned into Twizzlers,
Full of isssues,But my biggest issues with this film is that they have made all of the other characters weaker and less intelligent so Wanda can easily defeat them and be the most powerful person in the room. And that's just cheap.
The half that Riami directed is great,"The rest is garbage

There's an amazing movie in here and some truly amazing scenes - sadly Disney/Marvel decided to bury it underneath their usual mediocre crap. It's a mess."
"Good visuals, but it stops there","The story and character development is lacking and it feels like the worst Marvel movie I've watched.

The visual effects team did it's part but the writers dissapointed them and us, the viewers. They relied too much on the name and thought that a clicheic script will ""work"". It's not working and it leaves the viewer with nothing to look forward to in the next installements.

Would I recommend it? Maybe, if anyone is interested in the world of Dr. Strange. But this time it is a strange world and it's not compelling enough."
Good but,We all wanted to see more characters like spider-man and Logan and we didn't want to see the fantastic 4 die in easy way specially the professor but in order the movie was amazing 👏
"Below average storyline, great visuals though.","Great visual affects as expected from Marvel. The plot is lacking in many aspects. This is a below average story line, not what we have become accustomed to from the great Marvel studios. Spiderman was amazing, it's strange that the Doctor's movie lacked humour and was very dry."
It wasn't what I expected but it wasn't bad,"I sincerely expected more from this movie, at first it had been presented as a scary movie and I never felt that it belonged to that category, but leaving that aside, the movie has very good scenes and I feel that the movie and the story are well explained, only that I felt that the ending was too rushed and felt somewhat inorganic."
A woke fantasy movie.,Fast paced. Tries too many things hence feels cramped. Too many girl characters put in intentionally. Wait till you see the captain Marvel 😄... Hysterical. A bit dark movie (that's a good thing).
Just because someone stumbles and loses their way doesn't mean they're lost forever,"Directed by Sam Raimi, who is making his first Marvel movie and first superhero outing since completing his pre-MCU webslinging trilogy in 2007 with Spider-Man 3, Multiverse of Madness lives up to its title in all sorts of ways. This is indeed a ride through a weird and often bonkers house of mirrors known as the multiverse, full of mind-bending moments, trippy twists, and a fistful of surprises.

It's also very much a Sam Raimi movie, and perhaps the most singularly identifiable vision of an MCU director since James Gunn sprang Guardians of the Galaxy on us nearly eight years ago. And more to the point, it's a Sam Raimi horror movie, or at least what one would look like in the Marvel sandbox. Demons, monsters, reanimated corpses, jump scares, doppelgangers, and supernatural manifestations fill every corner of the screen, as Raimi races from scene to scene with barely a breath in between.

At the the centre of the madness: the unworkable and out-of-reach love affair between Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) and, more importantly, the obsessive quest of Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) to find her children somewhere out there in the multiverse... children that her fraying mind refuses to believe don't actually exist.

It's Wanda's search for her two sons, directly following up the events of 2021's WandaVision TV series, that makes it fortuitous when she crosses paths with America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), a young woman who seems to be the only person in existence with the ability to travel between universes. But America's power is also exceedingly dangerous to the existence of any universe through which she passes, forcing Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Wong (Benedict Wong), and Wanda to face some hard, strange choices as they realise the fate of all the realities is at stake.

I won't reveal much more than that, but Multiverse of Madness rolls out its narrative in fits and starts, and Raimi's headlong, head-spinning approach to storytelling occasionally leads the director to get in his own way. Reflecting its own title, Multiverse of Madness has a frantic, on-the-edge-of-losing-control feel that sends it careening toward its next set-piece while the rest of us catch up.

Later on Doctor Strange is introduced to the famed Marvel Comics tribunal known as the Illuminati, that will make a number of heads in the audience explode. There is fan service here aplenty, some of it already hinted at and some unexpected.

It's also a moment that feels like it's right out of the comics, and if anything, Raimi leans hard into comic book imagery, even more so than in any of his three Spider-Man movies. In fact, Multiverse of Madness might be the most outright comic book-y film in the entire MCU to date, not an easy task in a film series based on more than six decades of the damn things. But whereas earlier MCU installments might have held back or spoon-fed their more bizarre elements, Multiverse of Madness throws it all against the wall in often messy yet gloriously bizarre fashion.

Cumberbatch has grown increasingly comfortable in Strange's cloak with each of his now six live-action appearances in the MCU, and he's ably assisted by Wong, who throws off a lot of his previous ""funny sidekick"" vibe in favor of a more substantial presence. McAdams, reduced to little more than a stand-in in the original 2016 Doctor Strange origin story, is also given more to do. Gomez, who's got appealing screen presence and fits the part, is too often reduced to the role of exposition machine in the course of the film's events, and her performance suffers for it.

The top acting honours, however, go to Olsen as Wanda, who brings real, palpable, heartbreaking grief to the part along with an electrifying single-mindedness that makes you believe she's one of the most powerful people in the MCU. The arc started for Wanda way back in 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron reaches its summit here, and Olsen gives it her all with raw force.

Visually the film isn't always striking but there are Raimi trademarks aplenty, including whip pans, sudden tilts, zooms, and inside-out viewpoints. It comes to life the most during its trippier sequences, including one showstopping plunge through a cascading series of universes that is psychedelic and strangely unnerving.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness probably won't earn any new fans for the MCU, and it may even turn some moviegoers off as it's definitely a harder, more violent, and macabre outing than we've seen from Marvel to date. It also doesn't always land right; it's shaggy and occasionally jumps its own tracks. But it will please the legions of established fans by embracing the comic book weirdness of it all with vigor and abandon, as Sam Raimi creates possibly the MCU's most off-the-wall entry yet. Ironic that it would take such a crazily unsteady but rich movie to help steady the Marvel ship."
Compilicated,"Not that good , compilicated , alot of events , alot of ideas . What is the multiverse ! I didn't enjoy it like a normal marvel movie . Poor scenario ,"
Fun watch but something was missing,I watched it finally and all my expectations are crushed now cause this film is an ok ok watch which could have been been better. Firstly it's made in a very confusing way which a normal audience can't get and how this film progresses is also slightly odd. Film also was boring in between and what they were trying to do was also stupid. Multiverse concept could have been told to us in far more better wayway. I think sam raimi could have been avoided as a director here and the original director who directed 1st movie could have done well. But nevertheless uts entertaining with stunning visual effects and great acting. You can watch it once but dont expect much.
Immersion into the multiverse,"Marvel is diving into the multiverse storyline. Dreams are actually lives of your other universes, you exist in so many other universes where you're different but somehow also the same.

The central girl, america, in the story appears to be a multiversal unique girl who has the power to warp between universes but who cannot control her power. Due to this extraordinary ability, people are hunting her for her power, as every problem is said to have a solution in some universe.

Doctor Strange and the wizards from Kamar-Taj do have some experience with the multiverse but this is not just a question of wizardry. Indeed, witchcraft also plays hand in hand and Wanda became the Scarlet Witch - totally messed up from her Westview experience - wanting to capture the girl to finally live a peaceful life with her children. An unequal battle commences with a travel between universes being the byproduct.

It was a fine movie though these books were a little too much of a plot device to me and some decisions of the characters seemed questionable. Certain fights were too uneven (like the Illuminati were just this easily outclassed by the Scarlet Witch) and america was quite a bland character.

The jokes were good from time to time but nothing extraordinary. Yeah, I did expect a little more from this movie but it was definitely not bad."
It sucked. Don't waste ur money on it. Not worth it!!,
Yes,"At least top three marvel movies. I love how brutal they got and the visuals were phenomenal if you enjoyed superhero stuff like ""invincible""and you enjoyed the last Doctor strange movie you will love this one."
Raimi salvages probably one of the last few decent MCU films to be made,"Unless the MSheU fixes its woke madness then it will be a sinking ship.

Thankfully in this film the longer the film goes on the more they lean into Sam Raimi's world which makes the movie far more entertaining than watching female characters who have been unnecessarily created far more overpowered than their comic origins for a woke ideology.

Let's all hope that this and Thor are the beginning of Marvel and most importantly Disney returning to common sense."
Almost as bad as Black Widow and Eternals,"Cant take Elizabeth Olsen for serious. Really bad decision on the cast there. Just honest.

Should've just sticked with Wanda Vision.

The whole movie had no real story, the super villain is just a actor that I personally cant take serious. That just ruins the movie for me.

The only reason it still has 6 stars is the quality of cinematic and audio and stuff. They really had much money for this one. Yet I must say that I saw some CGI that wasnt as on point as it was in every other Marvel production.

Also: there were some jokes that werent really my type of humor.

Overall a decent movie ruined by 1 bad casting choice (in ms opinion)."
Terrible,"The first movie was pretty good, but this sequel is just too far out. They tried to make it like a horror film - cheesy fight scenes, corny dialogue, and too dark and spiritual for my liking. Disappointed in this one."
Best MCU movie since Infinity War/Endgame,"Saw at IMAX today. I am giving 10/10 to support. I think it should have at least 8.5* in general review score. Good storytelling, good pace, good visuals, perfect villain, without stupid jokes, fan service scene blown my mind."
"Sadly, too chaotic","The plottwists, world building elements as well as the extremely fast pasted story (CGI was great too) are all beneficial, yet I must admit that the movie itself didn't know where it was going. There was too much going on at once. The movie wasn't sure what genre it was actually portraying and the story itself felt like it was cut together from different drafts. The horror elements were something really fun and exciting. All in all I was having some fun (plot-wise) even though the trailer was telling a better story than the movie itself."
It hurts to rate a Marvel movie 6/7 or possibly lower,
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,
"Less than I expected, but still good and entertaining.","There was a lot of hype for the movie, which, as in many occasions raises my expectations a lot, the movie was inconsistent at times, but it was still good and entertaining."
Enjoyable,
Rarely did a title fit so perfectly,
Very entertaining movie,
I Really Enjoyed This,
WANDA VISION 2 with Doctor Strange Cameo.,"WANDA VISION 2 with Doctor Strange Cameo.

1. Less stars for fooling us with Trailer 1 that it follows No Way home incident. Less stars for storyline less interesting than doctor strange 1 and to make me feel like i am watching wanda vision 2 in theatre (watch ending, you will agree).

2. Watched First Day First Show (die hard Marvel fan). Typical MCU movie but with horor elements in it. Yah! Got jumpscared few times. Enjoyed it cause first, I trust Kevin Feige and second, i didn't had any cameo expectations (thank god). I watched it with low expectations and my god what a ride, loved it ! 3D pop outs are also there. Go, watch it. Its' MARVEL. Sam Raimi did great job by adding jump scare, and props to VFX team."
"My other, other, other self also hated it","The moment Dr Strange mentioned there was some other other other Dr Strange running around the ""universe"" they were in, I just wanted to give up altogether. No redeeming features that I recall."
What a horrible horrible story..,"It was more of a Halloween, horror movie and that too not a good one. The story line sucked, at some point it felt like a Wanda vision extension, other times marvel version of walking dead. Not sure how it got 7.1 rating, maybe Disney hired some bots?."
A Zombie Movie...Seriously?,"I wanted to see a Marvel action movie, not a zombie movie. Marvel, get to know your audience. So disappointed! (If it isn't obvious, this movie is not appropriate for kids.)"
Awesome movie but in my honest opinion there was nothing horror about it,A very well done movie and worth the wait. Sam Raimi absolutely killed it with this one and for being the first film he has directed in 9 years. Marvel needs to hold on tight to him this guy knows what he's doing. Glad to see him back and glad to have Doctor Strange back. Can't wait to see where this leads us.
Couldn't spot Strange behind Wanda,"Honestly wondering who's film this was supposed to be. I don't think Strange's appearance in his own film made any difference. He played no part. This entire film was practically about Wanda. I've been waiting ages for this sequel and the moment she was cast as a side character, I knew she'd be more of a main. They didn't even give Strange the chance to be a badass Sorcerer Supreme with any sort of special effect on the outcome. The Ancient One once said he was supposed to be the best of them. When is this? He was like a sideshow act in this film, apparently his sequel. So utterly disappointed."
Only good thing is Wanda,"Too much going one, hard to keep up with all the characters, multiverse.. just to much going on at once and to much to remember.

Only good thing about this movie is Wanda."
I'm shocked,"Dr strange one of my favorite marvel heroes It wasn't dr strange, it was wanda movie and thank you you just make me hate wanda.

It's not very much understandable and just a mess."
STUNNING 😍,"Sam Raimi brought a new tone to the MCU, and it felt so different and good. He delivers a film that's visually spectacular and energetic in ways no other Marvel film has been. ✨ His horror roots are also on display in some very satisfying ways. 😀

Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is as charismatic as ever and continued to be impressive in this role.

No one could have played Scarlet Witch as amazing as Elizabeth Olsen. Her transformation from a lovely mother figure to someone who's evil and depressed is really convincing.

As expected from MCU, the cinematography is breathtaking with visuals that are reminiscent of the colorful panels of comic books.

I don't like the soundtrack that much, but ""Lethal Symhonies"" with excerpts from Beethoven's symphony no. 5 in C major and Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor was quite impressive. Overall, I like the soundtrack from the previous part more. 🎶

I think that it should have been 20 minutes longer so that the scenes could breathe a little more and that there is more of an emotional connection in the film. The visuals alone were certainly worth the visit to the theatre. 😊"
not great,"...it was a bit all over the place and more cgi/blowing up stuff than story... a bit too Avengers style story instead of giving me some Deadpool great storyline.

The only thing I really got from the film was a journey into the various actor's filmmography.. Elizabeth Olsen, I knew she was younger sister to the twins.. she did some stuff as child actor, but broke out more when she was older. This made me wonder whether the Maximoff kids have interesting resumes... both do... both have done some major roles... Jett Klyne, probably a bit more, but Julian Hilliard has more series. But, the most interesting thing I came across was a film Jett Klyne was in called ""Writing Kim""... not studio, has its problems, but also a very good film and Jett is great in it.

Maybe I'll rewatch this Dr. Strange... but, it didn't really do it for me.almost became a crappy DC film."
This movie was extremely good,"Great acting-Wong and Dr. Strange convinced me that they were really scared of the power of Wanda. Hell, even Wanda scared me. This movie overall was a masterpiece with plot twists, and an awesome storyline. I think a lot of the negative reviews are people who are a very strong fans of the original marvel and don't like new things and change. The change was good! I love how the plot of the movie went against the audience's expectations and succeeded.

Ignore the negative reviews and go Watch the movie. It's a masterpiece and I want more of this version!

10/10!"
"The Horror, the Horror...","I regard myself as a casual cinema goer rather than particularly a Marvel fan, and for me the film was enjoyable.

Sam Rami added a horror element which lifted the film from the usual mass destruction/ no consequences style of most superhero films. And it was good to see both sides of the Wanda / Scarlet Witch character.

Don't think it was a problem that the film maybe didn't explore more of the alternative worlds in the Multiverse; it was more the MV concept that was an interesting element. Some nice unexpected cameos added to make a decent trip to the cinema:"
Good but bad,
Shoulda been R-rated,
Please don't reveal your story in trailers and TV spots,Marvel please fire the persons who ever in charge of marketing department you guys reveal so much in them that their are no wow moments left to experience in theaters I love the way u guys try to make this movie as violent as possible but its the marketing that ruin the all fun for me.
"I tried to rescue this, and failed","I went from watching a multiverse film which was one of the best films I've ever seen (Everything Everywhere All At Once) to watching a multiverse film that was one of the worst.

Video game level special effects, non-existent plot, scenes which were either uninteresting action or packed full of exposition, characters I couldn't care less about with no real story, and acting for which even a Razzie would be exorbitant (particularly from whoever played America Gonzalez). Even beer didn't improve the stench of pointlessness that I wasted two hours on."
Packed with horror and suspense elements!,"I'm indifferent to superhero movies because above all, especially with Marvel, all of them seem similar in tone and themes. That's what makes me goes awe when watching Doctor Strange's sequel, featuring Wanda Maximoff as the (sorta) villain and lots of multiverse issues,into a different experience. As a jumpy man, I got snatched numerous times by some of the scenes here. Not particularly terrifying that gives a horror vibe, but still gives the movie some texture while cruising the two-hour plot.

I like how the suspense and horror brought the story into a slasher-y, darker turn to the movie. Blood, graphic scenes are PG-13 ish but expected and it's still Marvel so bits of cameos, superhero cliches, and corny jokes are still there. So perhaps casual fans can still seeing the Marvel movie trademark.

Lack of Wanda backstory may confuses some who don't watch WandaVision, and lots of the information given verbally (that sometimes seem lazy). But I had fun watching this and this makes me want to (finally) watch Spiderman."
Kinda a let down.,"Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness follows Dr. Strange as he travels the multiverse looking for a book that can help him stop an old friend. The movie was a let down and I only say that because of what we got in Spider-Man and that the movie was overhyped. The movie has an engaging story with some great CGI and great humour and it continues off from Wandavision. The movie does have some amazing cameos half way though the movie which fans will love.

Benedict Cumberbatch as always plays Doctor Strange and it's perfect what else is there to say. He plays 3 different versions of the Doctor. The one we have seen before. One where he is a zombie and one where he is evil. Benedict Wong returns as Wong and he is hilarious but also gets a lot more to do now. Elizabeth Olsen returns as Wanda And It continues off her story from wandavision. She has become the main bad guy and is willing to do whatever it takes to find her children she plays a scary villain. It was really terrifying to see her this way and kinda sad to see her fall so low. Xochitl Gomez plays new hero America Chavez she plays that young girl who doesn't know how to control her powers and is leaning the ropes. Rachel McAdams also comes back as Christine where she plays her normal self and then a different version where she is more badass and kinda gives a send off between her and Strange.

Overall the movie wasn't bad but it was a let down."
Just kind of boring.,"The script was weak as is most of the writing the mcu has been pushing out, its been hard to care about alot of the characters recently and introducing the new ones has made it even harder, alot of weak plot points and coincidences giving a entertaining enough but forgettable film."
Doctor Strange & The Multiverse of Madness,
Mind bendingly fantastic,For once a movie lives up to the hype. It's a real Sam Raimi movie. Take a comic book movie and mix it with a lot of drag me to hell and a bit of evil dead and this is what you get. Loved it from the first minute to the very last.
"Good, Solid Film with Sprinkles of Great","Dr. Strange MoM is a fun wild ride that is gets the action rolling almost immediately. Whether it's jumping through other universes and seeing fun and creative ideas like paint universes etc. What's wrong with this movie is that there feels like two movies clashing together. It feels like the Sam Raimi version and the generic safe Marvel movie fight each other constantly in this. We get some serious horror elements and arguably the most violent scenes we've seen in the MCU, as well as some very creative and cool shots. It's acted well across the board, I don't think there was any bad acting. I thought they did a good job of making sure America Chavez didn't become the main character as well. Some downsides here, there is some bad cgi but I'm willing to forgive it since a lot of this film has to be cgi.

The more and more I think about this film and the awesome individual scenes the more I feel like this could have been better. It is by no means bad, far from anywhere near the worst MCU films, in fact it's up with the best of the best during some points. I really wanted to give this an 8 but I feel like a 7 is more fitting. Just good, with sprinkles of great.

If you're an MCU fan or even just a Sam Raimi fan, this is must see in theaters. If you hate MCU and hate Sam Raimi, this is a skip. Somewhere in between? I recommend the watch eventually but not right away."
Leave your brains behind,"Imagine being Donkey Punched with a kakload of gobbledygook and multi universe hoohaa with special effects done on a home pc (except they're blurry and horrible). Like I guess anything can happen.

The crowd was unenthused."
What happened to comic related movies ?,
It's a lot to unpack and I feel a little betrayed by Marvel,Elizabeth Olsen definitely stole the show. She played the scarlet witch perfectly. The movie was so much fun to watch but moved along pretty fast. I can't help but feel a little betrayed with the direction Marvel went. Like what was the point of WandaVision and making us feel this enormous connection with Wanda and then they go and do us like this. I was intrigued but wasn't too happy with the direction they decided to go. I'm not fully sure how I feel about this but overall the movie was still top notch and a must see.
Not good at all.,"Just a series of loosely related set pieces to either facilitate cameos or distract with explosions and FX.

The whole premise is based on a moronic concept that just doesn't hold up to examination. A crazy lady wants kids. That is the total extent of the plot. Who writes this drivel?

I could understand it in a comic book but if this is the best writing/concept they can come up with for a big budget film they need to find jobs outside the creative field. Maybe they would be more suited to a job in customer service or waste management."
It is an odd and quite brave entry into the Marvel universe.,"It is not without its problems, but Sam Raimi injects more than enough macabre fun to overcome an uneven script and ensure that his sequel emerges as a consistently entertaining watch - nonetheless even though I do suspect that it will divide some viewers."
Disappointed,"To be spoiler free I am going to keep details out of the review...

This was a mediocre movie stitched together by a lot of nonsense scenes that seemed to be present just for a shock or a joke.

None of the characters behaved with anything resembling common sense. Their actions would contract themselves within seconds. Their motivations made little sense and seemed to vary from moment to moment.

Many plot points were contrived and ultimately just red herrings, which made whole sections of the movie pointless.

The incidental music seemed out of place and intrusive. Turning scenes comical when they were meant to be serious.

There were a lot of ""concepts"" in the movie, most of which were given very little explanation.

Scenes were overly gory and violent in ways that did not further the plot. It seemed more like a ""what can we get away with"" sort of thing. Much more akin to a slasher movie than an action or MCU movie.

Then, in true TV fashion, the convoluted plot is mostly and neatly resolved in the last five minutes.

I'm not one to harp on ""x character wasn't like the comics"" as a reason to bad mouth a movie. However, I do expect the characters to have some consistency within the movie. It's not character development when a character changes on a moment's notice for no reason; it's just bad writing / editing."
What mouth?,"Well, I absolutely loved it. But I'm a huge fan of Wanda Maximoff and completely invested in her character - Doctor Strange, less so, but I rewatched the first Doctor Strange movie recently and enjoyed it a lot more than I did on my first viewing.

Doctor Strange 2 is a wild ride and it's amazing that they were able to tell the story they did in a little over two hours runtime. This could easily have been another 3 hour MCU movie (and personally, I hope they release an extended version someday - the 'Raimi Cut') but I didn't feel the movie suffered for the relatively short runtime at all.

I did think the movie was a little bit scary for younger viewers (they really pushed that 12A rating to the limit) but I loved that. It shocked me in a way I wasn't expecting.

Most of the one star reviews here seem to be directed at the films 'wokeness' but it's really not that bad. There are movies that use 'wokeness' to stand out from the crowd (because they have nothing else of any value) but this movie is definitely not that. Not even a little bit.

I thought the movie was excellent and will be going to see it again as soon as I can."
A trash movie that gives you no time to scare,"Marvel have already made movies with more than two hours. I really don't know why they made the decision to play short in this so promissing movie.

The overall plot is very interesting, but the timing in my opinion is so wrong...

I didn't have time to care about wanda's motivations I didn't have time to emotionally engage with America enough to care about her life.

I didn't even have time to be surprised with our magnificent superhero politicians revelation. Five minutes later they simply didn't matter for the plot.

Everything is running so fast that in the scary parts i just thought: ""What the f... is happening here?"" and laugh, like i would in any trash movie.

The timing made every important dialogue look Dumb, and even the journey and lessons that stephen learned seemed less meaningful than it could be.

Sad... I was expecting more of my favorite character's movie.

It could be an 8, if the movie gave me time for this. Today it's gonna be six."
"Satisfying, very satisfying!","I've been a fan of Sam Raimi work since the first evil dead movie and let me tell you, Doctor Strange 2 has really responded to the madness inside me perfectly."
Really good movie,"I really liked this movie, movie is everywhere, but it works, some interesting characters do show up I won't spoil it, but fans will be happy, this movie is better than first film."
Solid 5/10,"Like most phase 4 of the MCU, it's plagued by the MCU formula. The formula hindered Sam Raimi from having much creative freedom. But the are scenes where we see his creative vision is present, and I wish that vision were throughout the film. And this film is the pinnacle of mediocre with its world-building. For a movie that explores the multiverse, it feels more constricting than No Way Home. I think the multiverse characters immersed us in No Way Home. Unlike in M. O. M, the world they travel to isn't like something we haven't seen before. And the cameos are not bad, but they are present in the movie. And so many stories beat come and go, it doesn't feel rushed, but it feels underwhelming. This movie is like a museum guide speedrunning the tour. Besides a few of the director's visions being the best part of the film, Wanda and Strange are amazing. People complain about Wanda's character, claiming it should've been resolved in WandaVision. Well, it's not M. O. M's fault. It's the people in Marvel not supervising the main story.

Despite Wanda being an annoying Karen sometimes, I did sympathize with the grief she holds, and the lengths she would take are understandable but still wrong. And Strange's arc in thinking sometimes there is another way, whereas Spidarman's arc doesn't know there is no other way but to accept the consequences. For Strange, it's a switch, where he must accept not to make reckless decisions by himself without any repercussion. And America Chavez is boring. Her emotions are just snarky, and she knows almost everything, girl.

But what's more annoying is when she doesn't take things seriously, as the revelation of her parents is just shrugged off like ok, whatever. How can we like a character if she doesn't give us a reason what to like about her? Lastly, her powers explain the mediocrity of the plot elements. It's too convenient. Overall it's a mediocre or middle-of-the-road film, execution-wise. They could've gone beyond, but somehow, this movie felt so at face value. Marvel should stop trying to make all their movies for kids or a safe audience. I would not recommend it, but I will not not recommend it."
"Stunning GFX-reel, not much of a movie though","I believe there is not a single scene without CGI or some effects here. All really amazing and masterfully done.

Could not really find the movie behind it all. Even inside the MCU, not a lot makes any sense here.

It's more like a conglomerate of scenes to show off effects, loosely tied by some kind of recurring lines for lack of a better word.

Nice to watch at times, but a bit too long for just that."
Meghhhhh,"Good movie, but unfortunately I expected so much more!

Spider-man gave a great foothold to move into the multiverse, however I don't feel like this movie progressed the MCU, it would have been a brilliant film if it wasn't built up to so much, the last half was so much weaker and felt so much more rushed than the first half!"
"Utter Madness, Raimi Style!","Doctor Strange & The Multiverse Of Madness is by all accounts a brilliant movie, and Marvel's first entry into the horror genre apparently.

It has a nearly all star cast, besides the new girl playing America Chavez. So nothing I can fault casting wise as the whole cast did really great work. The actress playing America Chavez newcomer she may be but really impressed with her acting in the movie.

In terms of special effects and sounds, well it's a Marvel film with the budget that comes attached to that. Absolutely brilliant visuals and audio throughout the movie.

In terms of story well, it's basically Wanda gone evil apparently from something which happened in her WandaVision show (Haven't watched it but heard what happened in it from family.). The story overall is pretty good though it feels very rushed to me, like the movie needed another hour to it at least to try give all its characters some meat rather then just leave them hanging bare bones in front of the audience.

While the title says Dr Strange in it, It honestly feels misleading. A more apt title would be America Chavez or Stepping Stone/Setup Film for future marvel projects. While this film had Dr Strange as its main character it just didn't feel like he was the main character in the movie. He is still there in nearly every frame but if the film was called America Chavez & The Multiverse Of Madness or something it would probably have worked as well.

Anyway enough of me going on about how it's a Doctor Strange film but feels like something else, the movie is still fun and really enjoyable to watch. It has a great cast and all the Special Effects money can buy. The story is a bit mad and kinda confusing at times but followable for the most part. A solid 7/10 from me!

P. S. Sam Raimi is a god damn amazing director!"
Don't listen to the bad reviews.!,"Tbh, i'm not a marvel fan, but i love benedict cumberbatch as dr strange, and both movies are worth it.!

This movie was the best movie in 2022, i can totally recommend it <3."
Exactly what I Expected...,I got everything I paid for. Everything went as expected. Satisfied. If you go expecting to a decent marvel movie sequel you should not be disappointed.
A miss or a hit??? Or a bit of both??,"What I liked about the movie: 1. The performances from everyone, especially Olsen and Cumberbatch. Both of their roles had great impact on the movie. Top notch.

2. This movie has some SPECTACULAR VFX!! Just Incredible and up to par!!!!! Along with the action... What a treat to watch... Too violent in terms of an MCU movie.. wow!! Was thrilled to see such thing.

3. The story is engaging and good, keeping you on the line and kinda thrilling. (has less plot holes than NWH, which I'll admire)

4. The ""dark"" (different for MCU) Raimi direction and Elfman's score is toooo good. Bravo for that. No doubt.

5. The introduction to Multiverse and it's aspects is great, The Illuminati's introduction, I liked it a lot... but........ (here comes the negative part)

1. But.... The way all of them are treated, not gonna lie, was just atrocious. I can't believe Marvel did such a move. No better or admirable moments for them (This is where NWH succeeded, they used every character at their finest and the movie was charming as hell, no one looked at the plot holes much) Even kinda letdown for exploration the ""Multiverse"". Not much as expected

2. I just don't know why the movie isn't as charming at some times, it loses it's grip cause of the good but a lot of convoluted screenplay in small time. The short runtime reduced the depth of a good story. Bit much for little runtime

3. America Chavez is a good character, we needed more of her origin, instead of making her the Macguffin. I'd like to see more of her...

4. Yaa ik we all love Wanda, but at times it was.. kinda too much of her for me. It wasn't a ""Scarlet Witch"" lead movie.

Final Verdict: Still from the beginning to the climax, movie is really engaging to watch. Some expectations aren't really fulfilled but np, got enough to enjoy... a solid movie. I won't compare it to NWH, but this movie had better screenplay and story, while NWH had that charm of success. Still go enjoy this movie... worth your money I can say. 4/5 Stars...

(Post credits scene is just the worst.... don't wait for it. Go home. First one is enough)"
"quite good, keeping surprise",
Good product by Marvel. Deserves Appreciation. (No spoiler Review),"Dr strange's sequel Really lived up to my expectations because story is convincing and logical follow up to MCU timeline. See we can't expect Kang, X-mens, Spidermans, and every single multiverse MCU villain in this single movie just because this movie titles Multiverse of Madness.

Wouldn't it be too soon to explore all the multiverse fun in a single movie?

The movie focuses on it's titled superhero dr. Strange who is trying to adjust his life after endgame. And one day he meets America Chaves and the multiverse begins to unfold.

The Antagonist or supervillain of the movie is great because it's powerful than Superhero and threat to him and multiverse.

I love how marvel is giving good villains who are more powerful than superheros, we all know Marvel always gets criticized for weak villains.

Watch this movies guys. See it's movie of Dr strange so its obvious it will show his struggles and journey to multiverse. Its not a movie of 'Cameos in Multiverse of Madness'.

So go to watch Dr strange and Wanda. Not to see your favorite characters coming for one minute cameo roles."
not what i expect,
I'm glad I waited until Disney+...,
Unorthodox Marvel entertainment with great acting,"It's was a great watch. Action sequences were amazing, the visual aspects were top notch and acting was brilliant. This is not your conventional Marvel movie. The best part, it made me drop a tear in few moments. Must watch."
Meh...Not the best,"Perhaps audiences in other universes will like this better. Or maybe the movie is just better in other universes.

Either way, no need to rewatch this again in this universe."
The first time I watched it...,
Worst Marvel movie ever,"Chaotic, unengaging, no memorable scenes or quotes. Script lost in a Lego-movie-like metaverse, vainly utilising (and destroying) major Marvel concepts like the Incursion and the Illuminati. One of the biggest actors of our time, Benedict Cumberbatch, spends his time swirling his hands in magic gestures. Elizabeth Olsen's performance is the only positive aspect."
Good for newbies. Great for MCU fans. Exceptional for comic book fans!,"I saw this movie with my nephew, my wife, and our daughter. My nephew is a newbie to the MCU and, while he had a lot of questions, he really enjoyed the film. My wife and our daughter are MCU fans (our daughter so much more so than my wife) and they really loved this movie. My wife is also a fan of the horror genre so it added to her delight. As for me, I have been collecting Marvel comics since I was 10 years old. This movie was the comics-to-film equivalent of an acid trip down memory lane. I can't wait to see it again!"
Second try,"My first review was rejected - I can only imagine this is because I was too honest with my disapproval of the MCU obsession with interracial relationships. But I have seen the errors of my ways.

This movie was awesome in every way and the interracial wedding at the beginning of the movie was 100% necessary to the plot and too many white people in a movie is only going to make it less cool.

All that aside, Wanda was fantastic (seriously) and this movie is a logical extension of WandaVision. Dr Strange was okay, but the whole multiverse thing is getting out of hand. I'm getting bored of it."
Not What I expected!!,"Doctor Strange 2 is a great movie but not what I expected. Wanda Maximoff (Elizibith Olsen) and Sorcerer Supreme Wong ( Benedict Wong) are the real highlights of the movie as usual Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) rules.

Although there are some questionable choices were made in the film. The main criticism for me is pacing which is really slow for my liking , when the movie's runtime was announced as 2h 6m I was worried how they would fit all the multiverse stuff and now after seeing the movie I think this would have been a great movie if the runtime was between 1h 30m to 1h 45 m as the story doesn't need more than that.

Important Note: Don't go to the movie just for the movies. Don't let your speculations be your expectations .Expectations are the theft of the joy.

Overall a solid entry and I'm not quite sure how all the fans would treat and feel about this movie.

8.2/10."
Expectations are killer,"I think people need to stop having preexisting notions of what should happen in every movie. Another thing- don't expect a movie filmed with cameos.

I loved the horror elements, the acting, and the visuals.

The plot was pretty straightforward and that gave more leeway to try and understand exactly what is happening with the mindbending multiverse and madness stuff.

Wanda is the most interesting character in this film.

It's not without it's faults though. It's pretty messy and hard to follow at points. It should have used an extra 20 minutes to flesh out a bit more.

Overall, this makes de me excited for the future of Doctor Strange. Sam Raimi did great."
What the heck did I just watch,The whole movie theater walked out of there in confusion. I watched a movie that could have been done in the first 30 mins stretched for roughly an hour and a half. The worst marvel movie I've ever seen. Do not pay money for that movie..... damn.
Such A Horror Movie,"Doctor Strange MoM is very different than the previous one. This one has horror vibe. It such a scary ande gore fest movie. The pacing, action, and cinematography intended to shock the audience.

The way they make Wanda return as the villain is a genius move. Now she's so powerful. Elizabeth Olsen deliver some serious acting here. If you've seen angry wild animal when their kid in danger, that's what Scarlet Witch feels like, furious. She release motherly wrath upon her enemies.

But, I also have some complain about this movie. With Multiverse as the title I was wishing to see Doctor Strange action in various world. While we get a lot of universe, they were just a glimpse. The actual world where Strange is in action is only a little. And to my surprise some CGI is a bit off. The first movie is better visually.

I really want to give this movie 9 stars rating. But, I still have complain other than the above. So I settle with 8, well, 8 and half maybe."
Wanda's Madness,"This wasn't exactly a multiverse of madness, rather Wanda's Madness, which is still great of course, but this was a golden opportunity to do a couple of more cameos and take advantage of the multiverse, it could have been a real madness but they decided to keep it simple.

With that said, it was a great movie, I loved this dark Wanda, killing people with no mercy, and I liked America Chavez as well. The special effects and scenes were awesome and, overall, very entertaining movie."
"""You break the rules and become a hero. I do it and I become the enemy. That doesn't seem fair.""","DOCTOR STRANGE 2 is indeed strange.... and creative, and facetious, often scary and always visually delicious. A few story beats disappoint but that's perhaps enviable after being spoilt so often in other MCU outings, yet this still manages to throw a few surprises at you later on. Elizabeth Olsen is spellbinding, new hero Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) has an exciting future and director Sam Raimi treats us to a host of haunted-house frights that have seldom been found in other comic book movies.

THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS is a messy yet imaginative thrill ride that will spin your head around from humorous start to bonkers finish."
Too dark seemed like horror movie at times,Very dark movie!! We took our kids to watch and it was a mistake. At times looked like a horror movie. Is this the direction Marvel is going? Has anyone else noticed the men keep being weaker and the women stronger?
Multiverse of Stories Opened,This movie is a complete visual extravaganza and also reveals several characters which might become crucial in the upcoming movies. Some of the scenes are well shot and good to watch in 3D.
Mediocre at best.,"Mediocre at best... LGBTQ message/indoctrination continues. Sure, I know... it's about inclusiveness... but where were the Asian Indian characters or did I somehow miss them. After all... there are 1.5 billion Asian Indians, shouldn't they be included? I wish the LGBTQ fascists would leave our children alone. Coming of age is difficult enough without confusing children to believe they might be one of sixteen genders (or however many there are this week)..."
Pointless movie but great cgi at times,Doctor strange hasn't had the best of films but this one is sooooooo boring don't watch there is no point the end credit scene doesn't matter it's just a hint of another doctor strange film whyyyyyy pointless don't watch although the CGI is good at times especially when they are going through different universes. Overall pointless film don't watch just trust me don't watch it.
"Should be called ""Wanda wants a kid""","Not really much of a story really, very over hyped.

I wouldn't reccomend watching at the movies.

There were some cool multiverse things, but it went nowhere."
Definitely madness!,"Wasn't perfect but it was a fantastic film!

Cast was great, cameos were also amazing!

Some of the fight scenes were brutal which was good to see in a marvel film for a change.

Thought the story in the movie was cool, can not wait to see Doctor Strange return for a 3rd movie!

Hopefully it doesn't take years to come out."
Both excellent and somewhat lacking at the same time,"By this point of the marvel universe or should I now say multiverse, there have been upwards of two movies and dozens of characters introduced from the big to the small. On the big screen and the small screen. However I'm beginning to to feel that for the casual fan who is not deeply into the comics or movies its very easy to get lost in the plot as one needs to have watched and understood at least several of the previous tv shows, in order to fully understand everything that's happening. The Screen I was watching the movie in 3 teenagers left the movie half way through and never returned. I can only presume it was to do with the plot confusing them as the movie is excellent if you can understand it.......

Taking into consideration if you're a viewer who's watched all the comics and seen all the shows and movies and follows the hype on YouTube, this is a great movie. The movie explores the multiverse which was touched on only briefly in the previous Spiderman movie. The movie turns into a big multiverse battle between the Dr Strange and The Scarlett witch. It was extremely entertaining, amazing visuals, and at times very funny. I'd highly recommond it, again more so if you are familiar with the movie. My only take away is that I feel the multiverse is overly bloated and in any one or two films 3 hours or two hours is never enough to do justice character's who appear or have the potential to appear. So I'm pulled in two directions by this movie, you'll either love it or be a bit turned off perhaps. Anyway 7/10."
better than no way home,"Sam Raimi does incredible comeback. Far better than no way home ;) Amazing visual graphics and the camera work, sound effects acting was decent. Recommended higly."
Multiverse of Wanda,"Perhaps from the first trailer show coupled with the film's so vigorous marketing, it was a little disappointing. But, overall I was able to enjoy this movie. This movie is good, only the impression of the ""multiverse"" carried throughout the film is less noticeable. There are only two multiverses out of so many universes that we might think of getting the action. In fact, Wanda's portion as the Scarlet Witch and the antagonist is too much and the plot of the story is more towards Wanda's background. American Chavez and Strange? Just a sweetener it seems. The existence of the Illuminati? It was amusing to see a fan-favorite group then brought up. I really like Doctor Strange's fight against Sinister Strange. Play beautifully by using musical elements combined with orange and purple colors. Sam Raimi brings this film with different views ranging from zoom out and zoom in to a very crazy transition mix."
Not my cup of tea,
"Umm, no","Maybe I do not write enough positive reviews, like: Last Star Fighter- loved it, Avengers Infinity War- loved it... This movie, just too much... Hard to follow, low budget CGI, and felt like you needed a ""score card"" to keep up with events.

This seems to tell a story, but I don't want to have to recall a decades worth of film. Actors and Actress do a great job, but nothing can save this film from itself.

Oh, and it was painfully boring at times. Not even the constant barrage of visual images could fix that."
"Great Story, So-so Execution","I really enjoyed the first Dr Strange. It was fun, weird, campy, and trippy. I admit much of my love for the first movie might just be my love for Cumberbatch... but I really liked it.

This movie is in many ways a worthy sequel. It has a great, trippy plot, wonderful actors and characters, and even though the tone is much darker, I enjoyed the overall thrust and premise. That said, certain parts of it were just... gross and unnecessary.

I write this as a rather sensitive mid-20-year-old who had to stop watching Agents of Shield bc it got way too sadistic and weird. I refuse to watch Moon Knight bc of some of the premises. I like watching tense action shows, but I am quickly turned off by too much gore. So, take from that what you will.

This movie did not cross the line of what I'm no longer willing to watch, but it came awfully close. I have never been fond of anything involving Zombies, demons, or demonic possession, and this included elements of essentially all three. It was at times a pseudo-horror film, for sure.

I don't regret watching it, but it has definitely turned me off from blindly watching any new MCU sequels (to be clear, I was always more of an incidental MCU follower anyway). I don't necessarily like where they are going with it these days."
I sleep,"Terrible writing as per usual from Marvel. I couldn't get passed the first 20 minutes of the film its so bad. Marvel really has to fire their current writers cause they suck. Don't watch this film I would fall asleep faster watching this movie than I would sinking down a couple melatonin capsules.

TERRIBLE!"
Disney TV Series Wandavision or was it just Strange,"Well I got to Watch this last night, I would have to say it was ONE of the Slackest Marvel Movie I've Seen .

This was like watching Disney's Tv Series Wandavision, the acting and script get that Lame it might as well have been 5 episodes of Wandavision or Doctor Strange what ever you call it but, for entertaining this missed it for sure.

Boring at most times with Tv like Script Writing and Acting , doesn't drag you in more of a boring TV Show then a Theater Movie.

What Happened to The Wanda's/Scarlet Witch Sokovia Accent ?

Why was she so focused on the Children wasn't Vision the Love of her Life ?

This made no sense and 1 year to late."
The Horror Movie Marvel Needed,"Sam Raimi always knows how to put on a show, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is no exception. It's an amazing introduction to the MCU's multiverse, really giving us an idea of what's out there to be explored, and setting up the anticipated Secret Wars. Elizabeth Olsen delivers a truly terrifying new side to the Scarlet Witch that has been long awaited in the Marvel fanbase, and she doesn't disappoint with it. Xochitl Gomez introduces a new, lovable character to the MCU: America Chavez. Not only are her powers something to get excited about for future multiversal trips, but she's easily a fun, wholesome character with lots of spunk. Benedict Cumberbatch is always a delight to see as Doctor Strange, and a lot of his new spells and tricks are something to get hyped about. And I couldn't make a review on it without mentioning that amazing soundtrack that blends amazingly with the scenes. This movie is full of action, and while there aren't a lot of new universes explored, and the movie does feel a little fast, it still holds its ground and gives the audience a good time while not overwhelming them. Not to mention it can be classed under the horror genre, something I'd love to see again in future MCU movies. All in all, while a little fast paced, it still has plenty to marvel at, so you'll hear no complaints from me if you ask if I want to watch it."
Story? What story?,"This was just painful to sit through. Way too long, and mostly about Wanda (the red witch). The special effects were incredible... and never-ending. The story was obscure. Took me 3 tries to finish it. If you're a fan of the ""universe"" and unending light shows, go for it, but if you have any finesse in your movie tastes, spare yourself!"
Give Elizabeth An Oscar,"Everyone is great in this movie but IMO Elizabeth Olsen was the standout and gave a bone chilling, endearing, sympathetic, and insane performance. Sam Raimi was such a fantastic choice to direct this movie and while it doesn't always work, most of the time it does in the most unsettling and creative ways. I really loved this movie and now have it as my 4th favorite MCU movie. Go out and see this, it's Stephen and Wanda unleashed for better or for worse and you owe yourself this experience. My score is a 9.5/10 with the caveat that you may absolutely hate this movie based on the fact that Sam is directing it so keep that in mind. Don't like Sam? Skip it, he's also unleashed here and at his best."
"I give it a 6, for old times sake",
"Demonic movie , waste of time!","Its not about Dr Strange. It's about witchcraft and demons.

Waste of time! Don't watch with kids, so much evil, demons, demonic, some exorcism. So disappointed wasted my money on a movie I can't even enjoy with kids. Never again!"
Welcome to Sam Raimi's mad world!,"The suspenseful horror film like effects are what sets this film apart. It is not wholly like a Marvel superhero film nor wholly like a suspenseful horror film by Sam Raimi. This is why I loved it. The multiverses could've been touched upon a bit more. Like someone said, it is more of madness than the multiverse. If only a balance was struck it would have been excellent."
"Disney, what are you doing?","I liked the first Doctor Strange and I had high hopes for the sequel because I thought Disney could make something even better, as there was a lot to improve upon, but alas, they didn't.

The story is a mess. Those rumours about reshoots and test audiences not loving this movie make sense, especially considering this film lost its original director. What's up with character assassination of Wanda? Why is Strange an afterthought in his own movie?

The only thing going for this movie are it's visuals (the 30 second glimpse of the different realities in the multiverse was visually breathtaking). Unfortunately, it looks like Disney/Marvel are focusing more on over the top CGI in this new phase as opposed to good storytelling."
Marvelous!,A perfect thriller with bold and wildest plot. Exceptional direction and storytelling. A visual treat to watch with excellent character performances. Exciting cameos. Best Marvel movie post infinity saga.
Trash Movie,"Don't expect much from this movie Not a good story really bad plot.

You will be really dissapointed after watching this movie.

The animation CGI and VFX were marvellous.

It's my opinion but Venom has a better story and plot than this shi- even amazing spiderman 1 has better character development than this movie."
"Very funny, but pacing inconsistent",
I don't understand so many bad reviews,
"great movie, i just didn't like the motivation of the antagonist",
Not upto the mark,
One Time Watchable Movie,"The story and screenplay of the movie is very good. Movie editing is perfect. The length of the movie is neither more nor less. Perfectly kept. It goes without saying that there is no background music. The VFX of the movie is awesome in one word. What I missed in the movie is not playing the cameo role of any big superhero character. If it is said which of the two movies in this series is better, then in a word, the movie of the first part was the best. Elizabeth Olsen, who played the villain role in the movie dies at the climax of the movie."
End of Marvel!,
Too much Wanda,
Positive Madness,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was a madness but Sam Raini pulled it off in a positive way.

It was one of the most action packed Marvel movies with the action kicking off from the opening scene and remaining consistent throughout.

Sam Raini's (Spider-Man 1-3, Evil Dead) presence on direction was readily apparent with this being one of, if not the most brutal marvel films in terms of how the action was delivered. There was also a horror feel to many of the scenes which is a nice change of tone from the usual Marvel films.

Dr strange's unique abilities allowed for a lot of creative leeway as does the multiverse in general. There is one particular scene with the use of music which i thought worked well, though not perfectly. At times I was wondering whether I was loving the scene or absolutely hating it. There were also a few times when i thought that CGI was overdone or could have looked better but i was able to deal with it in the end.

I enjoyed the story. Despite taking place in the multiverse, the story was relatively simply, straight forward and contained which worked well.

There are some interesting features in this... but they are best witnessed for first time on the big screen... Cumberbatch as Dr Strange was solid as usual and new girl America Chavez was a good addition that worked well with Dr Strange.

The best performance was from Elisabeth Olsen who is fantastic as Wanda as we saw in the Disney+ WandaVision series. She has a lot to work with given the depth of the character but she pulls it off perfectly. She helped to elevate the film making it one of the better entries into marvel phase 4."
"Chaotic, and not necessarily in a good way but not too bad either.",
Trippy and intriguing,"I didn't set my expextation high before seeing this movie, but it surprises me in a positive way, the acting, the visuals, all are very well done, congratulation to Sam Raimi for pulling this off!"
Horrible Story,
Multiverse Mash up,"Great actors, fantastic CGI and loads of action and I mean LOADS of action, so 6 stars from me. Unfortunately, it's all a bit muddled jumping from one scene to the next with abandon. When all is said and done, it's a goodish movie."
Visually stunning .. but that's it.,"They really went all out on the CGI for this movie which made it look beautiful and amazing visually. However the story and characters seemed to have got lost amongst all of the visual effects.

Because of all the visual effects, the actors didn't actually do much acting which is a shame because the I love the actors in this movie. The story was complex and complicated and it was hard to understand what was happening and where they were going next. It seemed like they forced too many things into this only 2hr movie.

If you want to be blown away by visual effects this is the movie for you. It definitely wasn't my favorite Dr Strange movie."
The trailer caught me but the movie didn't!,"In other words, the trailer for this seemed to come across as an action packed dark adventure but in actual fact the movie was just a regular adventure for an Avenger! I think besides that, you telling me there wasn't another option to beat Wanda? Ummm yes, take her power FFS. It's for the greater good or how about killing all the Wandas or even threaten Wandas fake kids, like ship them off to dark dimension! Think out of the box!"
My 2 cents,
Multiverse of Mess and Chaos,"The first time I saw the trailer, I thought they were hiding details and let us see only few scenes in order not to spoil the movie, but the movie isn't what we thought about. It doesn't deliver much madness or much multiverses. The main issue I have with the movie is the plot. It highly depends on the events of WandaVision. And also it is repeated because Wanda's actions from the show are the same here. In case you haven't watched the show, you'll mess a key point about the motivation of Wanda.

We were expecting weird and new worlds. In return, we saw a glimpse of that in a few seconds. The movie needs more time to explore the multiverse in its true form and to develop the character's ark of the little girl.

Not to mention there are only few cameos of certain characters.

The bright sides of the movie include the acting of the main characters, especially Elizabeth Olsen, the action scenes are awesome, the CGI are good but there is a scene or two were bad, and some details, I can't mention so not to spoil the movie, are great."
Horrifyingly Violent,Such a Disappointment from Marvel
CGI Madness Entangled with a Heartbreaking Tale,"Admist the CGI Insanity and alternate multiverses, which I frankly don't care much about, likes the final chapter of Wanda's character arc. And it is absolutely incredible! This film cultivates the foundations that WandaVision built and extends it to an emotionally propelled tale of loss and anguish which destroys Wanda from within.

The finale of her characterisation left me slightly reeling yet thankful that the inevitable has been executed so wonderfully.

Overall, this film is both deeply emotive and a headache at the same time.

Still well worth watching."
Would have been amazing if marvel studios itself did not spoiled it,Was so looking forward to dr strange movie and was hyped by first teaser in no way home . Going crazy with the multiverse theories . Don't know why Marvel studios release too many trailers containing major spoilers . They literally gave off most of the movie . Watching the movie really felt if those trailers wouldn't have been released this movie would be an epic in MCU.
Not as good as expected,Movie was immersive and very intriguing seeing different sides of the multiverse but overall didn't quite grab my emotions as no way home and some previous marvel movies the visuals where absolutely amazing but the story was a little lacking its still worth a watch and engaging but overall a 7.5 for me :).
I loved it,"My favorite Marvel movie. I love how the story mixes science with magic and the multiverse. Im really into philosophy and pondering the true nature of the universe, so this storyline is great. Never a dull moment, lots of really good action."
The Path of Universe destructing plots continuous...,"It stuns me that Marvel is pulling it off: The strangest stories and plots imbedded in the most stunning visual effects - and the result is a watchable movie.

Unfortunately a lot get lost on this path.

What I absolutely don't appreciate is, the continuity of universe (or multiverse?) destroying events. And in the doubling down of, well - madness. Madness, that nothing is as in our ""normal and rather boring"" universe (it isn't - but it is for sure not as fantastical).

More and more the MCU is converting to a style of genre which I haven't got much regard for: fantasy.

In early Marvel movies (e.g. Thor) magic was considered as part of science (just with other ""means""). However this (rather science fiction like interpretation) went totally out of the window.

Now there is apparently the difference between witchcraft and sorcery (don't ask me) - and there are demons and other ""monsters"".

I haven't watched this movie in the cinema - at this time, it is too much from to tolerate (even though the visual effects definitely rock more in the theater). And slowly I get to the point, that I am just annoyed by the sheer spectacle without real substance.

Maybe we can see a movie, without looming destruction of reality? You know - we have already enough problems in the real world???"
A dynamic rollercoaster you need to see on the big screen,"A movie with gorgeous visual effects and a beautiful, fantastical imagination.

The plot is interesting but some of the writing isn't great. Also the acting here and there is a little over the top dramatic and the twists & turns can be a bit much but it kind of makes it part of the charm."
An alright addition to the franchise,"Very good sequel and I can't imagine a better duo than Sam Raimi and Danny Elfman who both previously worked together on the Spiderman trilogy Raimi taking up the directors chair and Elfman doing the amazing score. This film was very fun to watch with absolutely amazing visual effects. Benedict Cumberbatch is brilliant once again as Doctor strange and I love how his character got further fleshed out and made me care for him even more. I wish Wong had some more screen time though as he was hilarious whenever on screen. What was also nice to see was the other multiverse characters either as different iterations of themselves or new whole characters to the MCU. However there was one element of the film which I didn't enjoy which was the antagonist Wanda I found her very tedious and annoying as I found her just acting the same as she did in Wanda vision, not learning a lesson after the events of the TV series. She has very little character progression until the very end of the film... That's nothing on Elizabeth Olsen's performance she's a great actress it has more to do with the writing and I just wished she had more of a motivation and wasn't as contradictory. Overall it's definitely worth a watch but it's not in my top 10 of the MCU films.

P.s there are two credit scenes one mid credit and one post credit... The post credit is not worth waiting 10 minutes for."
Pretty Good,
This movie should've been called WandaStrange.,"Good: Writing and acting amongst the cast was top notch and nobody felt like they could've done a better job. That and the visual effects are what carried the movie for me. Also, the cameos were surprising and set up future films in interesting ways. This movie HAS changed the MCU for the better.

Bad: Just about everything else. I already had set my expectations low because of the overall score of the reviews but I still came out disappointed. The build up in the first Act was exciting and fun. They set up so many things and it felt like a true Multiverse of Madness movie. However, from the 2nd act onwards, it all fell apart slowly and painfully. The villain was revealed way too soon and by the end, I didn't understand their motivation for their actions. The movie sets an excellent foundation for a big finale but what we got wasn't even on par with Disney Plus show finales. Multiversal travel was underwhelming and underused during the 2nd and 3rd acts. 'What If' did it better.

Perhaps this film is the 'Age of Ultron' of this phase. It's a lackluster movie that sets up the rest of the current phase, future movies and even future shows. It's not a bad movie by any means but I do feel like it could've been much much more. Such a shame."
Only Slightly Better than the Eternals,"I haven't turned it off in disgust yet, but I'm bored as heck.

The movie makers spent a fortune on CGI and figured, I guess, that that would be enough for Dr. Strange fans. But it's not. It's like a bad nightmare - no pun intended. I had high hopes for this movie, but they were dashed in the first twenty minutes.

If it helps, I hated Wanda Vision, so a continuation of Wanda's storyline is not interesting to me, either."
10/10,
horrible,
Great movie 🎥 🍿,
It's great if you've been following the franchise,If you haven't been following the franchise you will be lost and not know anything and I can't imagine going to the cinema and seeing a poster for this and going in blind because the movie starts off with no introduction. I found the scene with the head exploding kinda weird as the cinema I went to had kids in the theatre. Love Dr strange would love to see more of him but this wasn't his best film.
Got nothing but special effects going for it,"I did enjoy some of the fighting scenes and some of the special effects but thats the only thing this movie delievers on.

Everything else is just bad and generic."
Entertaining...But A Bit OverBoard...,"I've been a Marvel fan since the spiderman cartoon of the 60s/70s. Lately, I have missed many of the recent Marvel releases as they have released WAY too much at once! This Dr. Strange was good, maybe better than the last Dr. Strange?

What Lost it for me was about the 3/4 mark. There was just way too much going on at once. I did like the Wanda part of the story and felt generally the characters all had good chemistry with one another. The credits trailer made no sense?! All and all, worth seeing.

:~)"
Not what i expected,
Not sure what these low reviews are about,"This was the darkest Marvel movie yet. Dealt with witchcraft, black magic, demons, etc. And very violent.

Very exciting though and as usual, wonderful graphics."
Masterpiece,"This movie is really a heartwarming, it's CGI, storyline, performance by characters are very very good. The only disappointing thing is its short runtime.."
Masterpiece,
"Not enough multiverse, not enough madness","I liked the idea for the plot as we see Wanda continue to struggle with her emotions, her place in the world, and the events of Wandavision.

However, there could have been a better use for the cameos which didn't fit that well at all.

Seeing as it involved the darkhold, we could've witnessed some fantastic dark villains and creatures, along with some terrifying multiverse world's upon which the darkhold draws from - maybe even the negative zone for example.

In regards to multiverse's and madness well...there could've been so, so much more to offer and unfortunately I feel the opportunity was sadly missed to deliver a truly compelling fantasy horror.

Maybe this would have been better as a series and draw off some of the creative writing from Loki, or even something like Stranger Things has the creativity to indulge into other dimensions.

Overall, it was good but Feige's executive team missed an absolute sitter to have filmed something unique!!"
"Wow!!! I loved it, if you want to enjoy don't watch the trailer before the movie!!!","After Spider-Man 3 that the trailers and blogs ruined for me the element of surprise I promised myself not to watch the trailer of Doctor Strange 2, and because I did not watch the trailer and read speculations on the movie online I felt I was really surprised throughout the movie.

Doctor Strange 2 took me into the marvelous universe of Marvel.

The director Sam Raimi is amazing, and he did such a good job with this film.

It's a combination of fantasy and horror, so don't except light movie.

This one is for the true Marvel fans."
Best MCU movie so far,It breaks out of overplayed genre cliches and mixes Raimi-esque horror tropes with power fantasy. It's a blast. Substract one if you're not into Raimi classics.
If you waste a good villain to a stupid magic system and unbelievable stakes,
Not Like Marvel Movies #Heavy Spoilers,
Non-Spoiler Review,"First Of all, this movie is definitely not what you are expecting...this is on whole another level. Secondly, there are some scenes where you might be dissapointed, maybe some of you. Absolute masterpiece by MCU as always. Mommyyyy Wanda did steal the movie although story was bit slow, Marvel should have increased the Duration in final cut. Must Watch, You'll have best experience on Big Screen."
"*SPOILERS* Enjoyable, but incredibly flawed",
Horror elements saved this from being really bad,Probably the 5th worst film in the MCU. It was terribly dull and pretty woke along with a pointless plot. Acting wasn't the greatest but it wasn't that bad. The horror elements were pretty cool and probably saved the 7/10 rating. The multiverse stuff was pretty cool too but there definitely wasn't enough of it. Seems like a lot of people are harsh with their ratings these days but this was definitely entertaining enough for a 2 hour flick.
Wonderful,"I enjoyed every minute of it. Kept you engaged the whole time, was fast paced but not too fast where you can't keep up. Had some jump scares that made me as a grown adult jump. I love how it's a different feel than end game, infinity war, and Spider-Man no way home. Those movies had the same feel to them but this one was unique and had a very doctor strange feel to it."
A great disappointed,
Could have still been good without so much violence,
Fast and the furious 47: Steven Strange Drift,This movie had all the story and acting of a fast and furious movie and none of the family. But in typical marvel fashion it was loaded with cgi and bright colors. Is this the end? Is the marvel the latest thing Disney destroys? Where do I get my refund for both cost and time?
Absolute Madness,
Character Assassination,"It's painfully clear that Sam Raimi only watched parts of WandaVision (the parts he was told would be relevant), and straight up ignores all of Wanda's character development from that movie. Now she's making all the same mistakes again, but even more extreme, thanks to being corrupted by an evil book... I know Sam Raimi isn't good at believable female characters, but this is just sad. Kudos to Elizabeth Olsen for an amazing performance nontheless."
Love the film! I may have done some things different,
Beauty to behold (could've been perfect),"If i could, I'd ask everyone to watch this movie. Of course it had it's short comings but the visual design of this film was almost perfect! Despite the sometimes weird CGI (Seen Specially in the opening fight with Gargantos).

Visuals: 10/10
From beginning till the end, you'll be hooked! The character designs, the angles and direction & the sets.


Story: 7/10
A very simple plot with no weight. No big events or ripple effects from the acts in this story, and the last bit feels rushed.




Special Feats: (i.e., what makes it a must watch!)



Finally they show the impact of the power their characters possess! This also establishes Wanda as the threat she needed to be and it worked!

If you know, you know. The introductions in the Illuminati were pleasing."
Too much given away in the trailer and promo,"Nothing Unexpected ever happened, didn't like the way illuminati was used, the concept of multiverse was good though but for some reason the Fan Service did not worked perhaps because of too much was given away already to bring consumers to the product."
Madness as it should,"Multivere of madness feel like somethingelse from the first part. Violence and creepy at the same time. I think that what we called deep dark fantacy ,isn't it? Watching from all part of it ,This movie of marvel are incredible as always."
Have low expectations and you will not be disappointed,"The sequel to the 2016 doctor strange has deliverd great visuals and some horror elements that we haven't seen in a mcu film before, Raimi bulled this one perfectly.

Sam Raimi definitely put a splash of horror in this action film. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is darker & more violent than any previous MCU movie, which could be considered a strength. However, I felt like there was not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness. Despite the entertaining visuals, the plot is fairly chaotic, and the acting & dialogue are inconsistent. This movie is an entertaining ride, but it's a little too messy to stand on its own.

One of the best things about this film is the action sequences they were not long but they were made with raimi style and all the cast were great but elizabeth olsen was the shining star of the movie.

At the end, Multiverse of Madness isn't wildly unconventional in its story choices, but the fun it has exploring the possibilities of this narrative makes it a treat."
6 stars only for doctor strange,
"Good, but not great",Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is one of Marvel's only movies to show how they can ditch the same old recipe that they've been using for quite some time now. While it's no masterpiece it shows that not all Marvel movies are not built the same Which I appreciate.
Not a Wanda Movie Like Others proclaim,"There are significant character developments for Dr. Strange, supporting cast, and the sanctum. It also introduces a new future super hero. Not only that, but also develops story for the MCU as a whole. Don't listen to other's claims. They aren't real Dr. Strange fans!! If you love Dr. Strange, you will enjoy this movie. Whether its better or equal to the first can be argued, but either way you will see strange things in this movie, which is exactly why I love Dr. Strange and his movies are top tier for me of the MCU films."
What was this about !,Just not a good feeling Not the usual clever action story yes we had action lots of it just the story line had no sauce of adventure Yes I fell asleep Yes I got bored after the thing kept on repeating itself Yes I was expecting something better.
I loved it!,"Maybe i like the Scarlet Witch way too much, but this movie was by far the best one ive seen. Very interesting the way everything was played out, i loved the explanation of the darkhold its origin and everything about the movie was amazing."
The movie is very nice,
a chaotic head trip with little suspense,a mix bag of horror and CGA galore that didn't excel at either
Wandas emotional crisis,What a stupid plot/story. I wouldn't call this a doctor strange movie at all. The special effects are disney tv show level. What a waste of a title. Probably the worst MCU movie made so far.
"Weird, unusual, unique, and messy",
so much action and great 3D,"I loved it, there is a lot of action, well made, great visuals, great 3D, very interesting and complex, so many super powers - you just got to love it, if you're a super-hero fan!"
Great CGI lousy movie,"I was expecting more, it's nowhere near as good as the last movie as it lacks the suspense, the character development and the storyline of the original. Even the acting was below par and the movie jumps all over the place with little explanation and with some juvenille parts that felt at odds with the rest.

Visually the CGI was stunning, full of interest and detail however it couldn't rescue the movie which was confusing, boring at times and therefore too long. With such a big budget it's disappointing that the result was so mediocre."
Decent. But that's it.,
Waste of time - don't watch it,"Why do these super hero movies get cornier and worse? The director , the script ?? I'm so glad I didn't pay for it- caught it on Disney. Total rubbish in my opinion."
I looks great,"It looks good, very good indeed.

But i lost the interest

Then..... I fell asleep after 30min, someting i almost never do during a film in the middle of the day.

I will try again."
Who is this for? Seriously I dont get it,"I'm a big time comic book collector so I check out all these Disney movies and even like some of them a lot despite Disneys best efforts to ruin Marvel. I just don't understand the appeal of a Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange teamup comic book. Like, if this was a comic book it would not be on my pull list. They are two side characters that are sometimes used as deus ex machinas in the big popular comic books. It was kind of enjoyable for me as a fan to see these comic characters and the Darkhold on a big screen, but I dont understand what the illiterate masses who dont read comics are getting out of any of this.

I didn't even watch the whole first movie because it was really boring, but Raimi pulled me in here and did a great job here of making the best Scarlet Witch movie possible. Which is still not that interesting of a focus given the epic scope and storied history of the Marvel Comics Universe. I appreciated it as a comics nerd since a toddler but why is everybody else watching this? I really don't get it. Its a Scarlet Witch, America Chavez, Darkhold, Dr Strange (in that order) comic brought to life. Nobody would buy those comics, never in history have they been big sellers.

I guess people are just watching for the end credits scenes in hopes the next movie it teases looks cool and so on and on it goes. This time we get a clip of an obscure lame comics character played by former movie star Childabuse Theron. Whooptie Doo. Raimi made it the best it could be, love him, extra points there, I'm just baffled by the popularity of this one. I would only recommend this to someone who has been reading comic books for decades and just wants to see these characters live acted out for an hour or two, and only if you have spare time or really love Raimi. Feels like it should have a niche audience of me and a small group."
Exciting work of art,"Similar to other MCU movies, Doctor Strange is reasonably good. Even though it is mainly a simple theme with eye-rolling jokes, it is enjoyable and fast-paced. Awesome visuals, fun plot twists, thrilling action, outstanding acting and an inventive culmination with the villain add to the solid production values. Excellent performances by Benedict Cumberbatch and the entire cast."
Boring,I think spiderman no way home is excellent but Hollywood should stop now by making those superhero movies again and again and again and again and so onnnnn. This movie is bad boring and nothing is happening...its just the story of mother wanted her kids back that's it. Did not expect that from raimi.
"Should have been called ""Dr. Strange: Everything, Everywhere, All at Once""",
Entertaining,
Mind blowing movie,"Don't listen to the haters, they just can't accept a change. Movie is unique in every different aspect from the other Marvel movies in a good sense and you will go in the theatre with an open mind, you will enjoy every single shot of this movie. Only complaint I have is that I wanted to see more and that explains how good it is. Kudos! To Marvel for trying something unique."
Unique,Not a typical marvel movie yet not soo away from it. This movie has Sam remi written all over it and thats what makes this movie enjoyable. Less cheese and more darker tone can also be a good movie but long term marvel fan boys wont like this movie so much. Elizabeth olsen have done such a great job and rest of the cast is just okey . The movie could have done more on exploring the multiverse as at the end we will feel like wanting more. At the end this movie makes me wonder what darker version Scott had in his mind.
Nice ideas poorly executed,
Just absolute madness,Just ignore the negative reviews and go watch this movie. It will be worth every penny. You will have a great time. Also there is a part of horror added in this movie.
Good movie Great acting &the TV commercial work against the movie,"It's not bad at all frfr but it's more of a Wanda movie then doctor strange movie if it was name Wanda at the multiverse of madness at would have a amazing movie to me frfr, the only thing that had me like oh ok was how they ended his first love interest with the other doctor and introduce his real wife from the comics into the movie and I believe the commercial spots hurt the movie big time it take a way from the big impact professor X of Illuminati would have had if they would have show if they would have just kept him a secret, if they put his wife instead and keep professor X a secret it could have been extremely better it is very gruesome doe big time not scary but very gruesome..... C+ at best, it move to fast in the beginning but was great even doe they spent to long fighting the one eyed octopus which was very pointless because clearly the dream leading up to them meeting establish a connection between them which was good to me if they would have killed the monster and a shorter time and would have great but to drag the fight on so long was complete overkill but the first act of the movie is a A, the middle part of the movie dragged if you don't follow the other movies or certain shows you won't understand and maybe get lost I got a little lost and I look at everything marvel but luckily Wanda was the glue for the middle act frfr she kept it together, the middle act it's a B-, The ending wasn't as good as the beginning the ending wasn't good it was soso at best frfr the story line wasn't as interesting as I felt it would have some people died to easily for my liking personally why introduce the Illuminati if your gonna just do what they did to them low key spoiler they should have kept professor X alive killing off black bolt and Captain marvel not bad but to kill off professor X, Captain and Mr. Fantastic him self was pointless to me for the story line not cool at all I'm shocked vision wasn't in it very disappointing on that end but I agree it is a average movie it's a 7 or 8 on a scale from 1 to 10, the jump scare was pretty dope I wish was craven was alive OMG 😱 and the acting everyone did their thing but the lady who stole the movie to me was whoever the girl was who played America Chavez I love it."
It's a good emotional movie,
Bad,
What a mess.,"What a mess: 80% CGI, 20% riffing on the concept of the Multiverse. How this left the initial storyboarding is beyond me. We've lost count of the storyline 'pivots', retained little of the supposed storyline and have absolutely no empathy for any of the characters. Regrettable waste of 2+ hours. The 2 stars reflect the amazing CGI work, which is full marks for what should comprise 20% of the movie. Zero marks for storyline. The end credits scene (involving the fast food vendor) perfectly summarises our feelings towards the movie."
Multiverse: Scarlet Witch Into Madness (With Doctor Strange),
I feel like I stepped in another universe to watch this Marvel movie,"The movie was action packed and most of the material developments clicked together fairly well on the big screen. The pairing of Scarlet Witch and Dr. Strange was significantly better than the pairing of the Hulk and Thor in Thor: Ragnarok. I also thought the dynamic between the two leads was better than the pairing of Dr. Strange and Spiderman. That said, this latest MCU installment gets demerits for releasing a movie that diverges from the usual family fun MCU that I've been accustomed to. In fact when we left the theatre, my young daughters friend had tears in her eyes. ""It was so gory"" she said. She wasn't wrong. I also left the theatre unsettled and disturbed by what I just watched. Not that I have a problem with horror, but if I want to see a horror film, I would go see a horror film. I was here with my kids for a big-screen adaption of a superhero comic. Instead, this movie just left a bad taste in my mouth. Beyond some of the unnecessary violence, I do have to give credit to Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Benedict Wong and Rachel McAdams for their strong performances. So, it's unforunate that a few upsetting scenes spoiled the fun."
AMAZING!!!! NO WORDS IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!!!!!!,SAM RAIMI DID IT just Go And watch the movie... before watch wanda vision and what if... its veryyyy important... the madness is begins.... This visually splendid and colourful multiverse saga casts its magic spell.
Worthless side character holds this film back,"The majority of this movie is pretty fantastic. Interesting plot, dynamic characters, action. The only thing holding it back is America Chavez. They finally add a prominent Latina character to marvel, just to have her be an annoyance. It's a typical story of ""I can't control my powers, WAIT! I could alllll along."" Which by itself would have been bearable, but then Disney had to throw in the stupidest propaganda lines. Was her having 2 moms central or important to the story? Nope. Was her being lgbtq? Nope. Her explaining how socialism is the best? Nada. Well, maybe her backstory works. Nope, no backstory. She a lesbian with two moms and unlimited power, yup that's it. It makes her character feel kind of worthless and since she is a main character of this movie, it holds the entire film back."
Disappointed,"I had so much hope & excitement for this film after Wanda Vision, Loki & No Way Home (Which were high quality writing & production). Waiting for this film to open up the the Multiverse and introduce New/Old heroes to this Marvel Universe. It failed miserably, I loved Dr Strange 1 but I am not looking forward to this character/series & America Schavez going forward. Hope to see Wanda from Wanda vision and a few of the other Heroes who had cameos. Marvel Phase 4 Movies are now 2 of 4 in bad movies (Strange & Eternals)."
Rather Busy,"As a film it's more about madness than magic. While Marvels 'The Eternals' offers a more promising direction for the whole franchise, the producers decided they needed a switching yard in order to pull together all of the complicated strands of the MCU. I suppose it does it's job. Sam Rami is good at monsters but the film is so busy It comes off more like a cross between a soap opera and an amusement park ride than s film about magic. Sam Rami knows his monsters but I don't anyone could succeed putting together a coherent narrative g to hat doesn't require a whole slew of fan based you tube videos to figure out. It does a respectable job of announcing that from now on, everything Marvel is multiverse, everywhere, all the time.

As a stand alone it's pretty uneven, cramming an incredible lot of plot twists into one overwhelming vehicle, at times hurtling forward with unrelenting action and then seeming to stop for totally static scenes of dramatic exposition. The title is apt, as the plot and dialogue more or less resembles an intense psychotic episode. Being a major fan of the Doctor Strange character, I look forward to future narratives with a bit more coherence along with ghe slugfest."
nice movie,
Amazing.,"Marvel definitely took a darker tone with this film. Raimi did BEAUTIFULLY. The score, the tone, the camera angles. Was very reminiscent of Spider-Man franchise in terms of the cinematography. Don't listen to the mixed reviews and Wanda HATERS. This was a Wanda film and we knew that from the BEGINNING. To me this movie was so good that I wished it was LONGER."
plainly amazing,"Many will say that it is a biased opinion. However, if you follow the movies up till now, you will realize the character arcs are exactly where they need to be. I don't think there was a single thing i didn't like about the film. Not only was it surprising in various aspects, but it kept everyone at the edge of their seats wondering what else could possibly happen. The actors all embodied their characters to an incredible level and yet took them to a whole new aspect for people to see them in. The horrors scenes weren't exactly horror, more like jump scares and that's coming from a person who doesn't do horror whatsoever. It won't be the movie for everyone, but in my humble opinion, it's a pretty cool story with many contributions that were needed to fulfill what the multiverse really is."
Bringing horror to the mcu,A madness for sure!! Like how it felt like a horror/triller...thats what we get when we're talking about witches and sorcerers!! So excited to see what this opened up for marvel!
Get ready for a thrilling ride,Absolutely loved it. The dark side of Scarlett witch is the best surprise from marvel. And being a Cumberbatch fan I found the movie very impressive. Marvel did a good job connecting What if and Wanda vision with this.
Dull and Duller,
"Astonishment, Gore and Madness","This is the scariest Marvel movie ever made and the movie we've seen the strongest of the Scarlet Witch. With Sam Raimi's style, a mix of horror, brutality and bewilderment, this movie is a strange, frightening and fast-paced adventure where we see what Wanda is capable of as the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange is still a burgeoning wizard with a lot to learn. The events are moving so fast from the beginning to the end of the movie that you may not have time to breathe, it is a very fast and very compressed movie. Also, we don't get the Doctor Strange vibe that much, it was more like a Scarlet Witch solo movie. While watching the movie, you can experience emotional changes very often and you can come across scenes that you cannot believe your eyes in, such that some scenes are really unbelievable, your brain cannot decide whether it's ridiculous or incredible. It's definitely a good movie for Marvel fans and those who don't get their expectations too high, but it's too messy in terms of the script and the course of events."
A Spectacular Misfire,"The film is spectacular to look at but falls short from delivering us a truly memorable experience. Marvel films have entertained us for over a decade now but there have been slight misfires here and there. This is one of those instances and it disappoints more after a ""multiversal"" celebration of all thing superhero in SpiderMan : No Way Home."
First Thoughts,
Great movie but weird.,"If you're a fan of Sam Raimi you'll love this movie. It is Strange in some of the best ways possible. I don't consider it anything like ""best motion picture of the year""(despite a high rating). It is great for what it is and if you're looking for something that doesn't hit you over the head with an over-the-top political message this will be a good experience. It's by no means perfect but there's a lot to take from it. Especially the direction of Sam Raimi, it's one of the best looking Marvel Films to date. You can tell Raimi's personality is all over the film. Like I said it is strange in some of the best ways possible, but flawed if Strange isn't for you. Being open to the film is on you. Finally, the writing is just as weird as you'd expect a Raimi film to be. The one liners are just a fun addition, they're not like the brilliant cheese of George Lucas. The major flaw could be America Chavez who feels a bit like a plot device rather than an actual character.(this common but not oppressive). I'm not a ""marvel fanatic"" I appreciate what this is and what it is a generally enjoyable experience. I haven't watched every marvel show, nor do I care to watch all of them. I can't stress enough how important it is to be open, I can suspend belief to see a guy jump through universes. I probably can look past some issues I might see with the plot."
Marvel Characters Featuring Dr. Strange,"I literally have a headache after watching this movie. So much being thrown at us all within a 2 hr runtime. When it's all said and done I feel like this isnt a sequel to the first Doctor Strange movie, and more of a sequel to ""The MCU"". Stephen's story isnt the main focus. The movie chooses to focus on America Chavez, and Wanda, which isnt a bad thing necessarily. I needed this massive idea of a movie to take it's time. It doesnt. Sam Raimi had a mission making this flick that's for sure. I loved the nods to Evil Dead. The CGI was great at some points, and bad in others. Very confused as to why some shots felt like we were watching Spy Kids 3D. And some other shots looked incredible. This was overall a pretty good installment for the MCU Not for Doctor Strange as a character."
Got to wash my eyes,"Conflicted about which was worse - the plot, the camerawork, or characters. I surely hope we live in an only striving universe, which had a misfortune to witness the horibble mess, that came upon all the viewers in a form of this movie. Sam Raimi should have finished his directing career after Spiderman 2, and then skiddadle to another universe, where he could exploit his talents furter, like driving a cab for a living, and leaving us peasants alone. P. S. I wish there was a law, which would allow you to get a refund upon watching such horrible flicks."
Eyes were glued to the screen,"I feel like; if you didnt like this movie, you just like to hate on marvel. Entertainment wise, this movie is a 10/10, stop being so overly analytic, there is great acting, extremely impressive visual effects, and an entertaining story line, lots of fun small details. Personally i feel like movies, should be about being completely swallowed by whats going on, and 90% of the story made sense ""pace"" wise, imo. I thought it was really cool and funny."
good,
Awesome,"This movie was great. Going into this I thought I'd be underwhelmed but I found this really enjoyable and overall a good movie. As an MCU and Sam Raimi Spiderman fan I was also hyped seeing this movie and it didn't disappoint. The horror was really cool Although I thought there'd be more. America Chavez's debut to the MCU was cool and I'm really looking forward to seeing more of her. Glad to see Rachael back as Christine again always a pleasure. All the performances of everyone was OP and the cameos were awesome. OVERALL AWESOME MOVIE, CANT WAIT TO REWATCH IN IMAX."
Stunning visuals and a touch from the director,"Great movie, the 3D effects are collyrium to the eyes. Amazing how much freedom Sam Raimi was given to apply to this movie. People might argue that the story is confusing or alternative, but I loved it. Maybe I am suspicious because I love these kind of stories like Amnesia, Donnie Darko, Minority Report, Abre Los Ojos (Vanilla Sky) etc. Much better than the previous one and I highly recommend IMAX/3D. Overall, one of the best Marvel movies out there due the fact it's not your regular super hero movie, very innovative for the genre."
Enjoyed it,"I am honestly not sure, what all the hate for this movie is all about. Its a good movie. Not perfect, but good movie. I didnt come out of the theatre kicking myself for wasting a couple of hours of my day. I am extremely satisfied with the movie. But then, I am not a movie expert. Just a MCU fan."
Good but definitely not what I expected.,
Better than No Way Home,"This movie was very well structured with a smooth continuity and everything seemed fair enough to blend with the flow of the picture.

But I seriously am concerned with critics and people not being as generous as they wers with the SM No Way Home. This movie was clearly a step better than the Spider Man sequel."
Do they not understand what makes Marvel movies good?,"Very disappointed. I thoroughly enjoy the MCU, the balance of fun and action, sure there have been a few missteps or less than stellar films. But this is the first one I actually regret seeing.

I left the theater feeling disturbed and unpleasant. Surprisingly violent and gruesome, not actively gory but plenty disturbing imagry. Add a few scenes of unsettling demon imagry and a unsatisfying ending making this the one Marvel film I will never watch again.

Do not see Dr Strange In the Multiverse of Madness. Violent, gory, demon imagery, disturbing. Absolutely not good."
Marvel getting worse with each subsequent film,"After the Initial run of films it feels as though there's no plan anymore. Marvel are manufacturing movies knowing there will be an audience regardless of content... and the content is getting bad, really bad. If movies continue on this vein I fear it won't be long till marvel movies stifle to attract an audience."
Dont have any words left.,"I had high expectations for the movie, since I liked the first one and thought it will be a nice trip through different universes.

What it delivered: -Dr Strange isn't really the main character in his own movie, but ""America"" (who talks Spanish now and then... why? WHY?) and Wanda. The story would be okay for another Wanda movie tho.

-Mid action scenes, some good ones.

1/10 story and writing, as i said in the beginning in wasnt really a trip through different universes, but a the 0815 Hollywood action hero movie.




Gave some stars because I like Dr. Strange as a hero.

I'm too tired of these types of movies, everyone is the same the story is just so bad written and boring as already explained in other reviews. Wake up Disney and try to produce something different, nobody wants these C movies/series (same problem with Mrs. Marvel) I can't do it anymore, I cannot do this to myself anymore."
Rename the movie,
Stop Kevin Feige,
another Cliché film from holywood,"Well its another Cliché film from holywood american are hero they save the world again again just compare this marvel movies with films like face off green cast away &... which is better?

Holywood is dead."
"Lots going on, but I still got bored in parts","It will be hard to write a review without spoilers because the trailers we watched before going in did not spoil anything!

We knew that this would be about the multiverse and we have visited it before in other Marvel installments. For some reason, I find all of the cgi in the Dr. Strange movies very tedious and over done, especially when the characters are flailing through the multiverses, but even sometimes all of the sorcerer stuff, especially when monsters are involved. My favorite parts were 1. That I think this movie brings about some closure for Strangelove and Christine Palmer, over a couple of different universes actually, 2. All the stuff towards the end with death helping to defeat the villian (I can't be specific) and 3. The outtake during the final credits that allude to what is coming next for Strangelove! I guess I was pretty disappointed that this movie went in the opposite direction of where I thought it was going to go."
"Wrong director for the job, massively disappointing","What on earth were they thinking hiring Sam Raimi for this?? His Spiderman films were (arguably) okay for the time but nothing he's done since has been remotely impressive.. There were a few redeeming scenes in the film, but these were absolutely few and far between. The 'suspense' was completely artificial and didn't belong in an MCU film, there were -so- many outdated filmmaking practices (zooming into people's faces for reaction shots, crossfades between multiple shots at the same time etc) that were absolutely immersion breaking and honestly laughable.

As a huge huge Dr Strange fan, this film was the biggest let down I've had throughout the entire franchise. I can honestly say this was the worst film I've seen at a cinema in a good decade. So, so many strange choices, poor VFX, bad makeup, MASSIVE plot holes (trapping Wanda behind a steel door as if it would stop her for some reason??). For a character that can literally manipulate matter at will, why throughout the entire film was she just throwing destructive balls of magic?? For a film with literally infinite possibilities, why was it just comprised of a handful of characters chasing each other around the whole time? Why didn't the multiverse collapse in on itself or something actually interesting happen? So disappointing.

Honestly, absolute garbage and I was genuinely tempted to ask for a refund for the first time ever in a cinema. Why wasn't this directed by Scott Derrickson? I feel he wouldn't have butchered it.."
Not bad but quite disappointing since it was so hyped,
Pathetic,This movie is awful and certainly not for kids. It has some very scary parts for kids. I have no idea how it gets a 7.2 overall. The story line is weak. Clearly the writers ran out of ideas.
Madness galore,
SO much FUN!,"Not sure why anyone doesn't LOVE Sam Raimi's MARVEL movies! Unlike those lame cookie-cutter Avengers flicks, this one is SUPER creative... super FUN.. super colorful and original! More please from Sam Raimi! Spider-Man 1-3 were the BEST! Far better than these new whack Spider-Mans where there isn't even Mary Jane??? At least Dr. Strange does NOT disappoint!"
"A wild trip with more Rachel McAdams, Elizabeth Olsen, action and you can actually feel afraid for Dr Strange.","Given the title Multiverse of Madness, and having Sam Raimi directing it, I was excited about the movie. Here are things I enjoyed about the movie. First, there is more Rachel McAdams. McAdams is a very talented actress and her talent was criminally wasted in the first Dr Strange. Here, she plays a more important role in the story, and I love every bit of it. Second, there is more Elizabeth Olsen. I have not seen her TV series (not everyone can access Disney Plus), and I always felt that Olsen's character is very under-used. Here, Olsen is able utilize her acting skills, and her character gets to use her powers even more. Third, there are tons of action. There are magical fights, and martial arts. I am surprised Dr Strange knows martial arts on top of magic. I also love the cameos. They were great fun. There are some Sam Raimi trademarks. We have the moving cameras, horror elements, and gore. There were times, I actually feel frightened for Dr Strange, and this is why the movie works. Dr Strange is just a guy who knows magic and he is actually challenged. You know he will win, (this being a superhero movie), but his abilities are stretched. He has to use his wit, magic, and fighting skills in order to save the multiverse. The only main problem about the movie, was I was expecting more universes involved. Though Dr Strange does travel through universes, the scope feels very limited. Another thing is that we care more about the villain than our protagonist. Dr Strange has problems, but Raimi seems more focused on the Strange running around than having the audience care about him. This is a drawback to the story because it could have elevated the story much more. But in the end I love the movie, and if you are an Evil Dead fan, you will love this. There are scenes which pay homage to the Evil Dead series too."
Every monster screams before attacking -.-,"Incredibly bad cgi. Very bad story. And why does every monster have to scream before attacking, and why waste so much time talking when you're on the verge of death. This was such a stupid movie. And don't get me started on the video angles, and cut scenes. It was like watching a sci fi movie from 1990s. It was just so bizarre. If the monsters in this movie literally stopped screaming and just went ahead and did what they were supposed to do, this movie could be 5 minutes instead of 2 hours. What happened to mcu? I could see the ending a mile away, everyone could."
Worse the second time.,"This movie has ended my Marvel theatre run. I haven't missed a single one in the theater, even before MCU. But I can't anymore. This movie is ridiculous. Disney isn't concerned with making good movies anymore. The best scene is the one with Bruce Campbell."
Worst movie ever,"Up to this point, the 2012 Dredd remake has been the worst film ever, but this one has taken the baton from it. Okay, we know that CGI can do everything nowadays, but it's just not enough to make a good movie. We need some ideas, some sotry, some meaningful plot, not just some endlessly chunky lunacy. Thank you very much Sam Raimi, but please don't ever direct a Marvel movie again. Or rather, never direct a movie again."
"It's kind of like Doctor Strange's ""Iron Man 2"", if that makes sense.","I'll explain what I mean with my headline on top. I like the films that came before the sequels more, not to mention both sequels seemed to have stuff cut out of them. And also, Iron Man 2 was essentially a setup movie for ""The Avengers"", while this movie has cameos from people who will most likely be seen again in some capacity. Sam Raimi says that 35 minutes of footage was cut out of the film before release and I feel like that probably hurt the quality of this movie for me personally. The stuff that was cut out probably could have resolved some of the issues that are present with the released cuts of the two respective movies. I thought this movie was fine and it was an enjoyable, breezy entertainment at best. And while I don't really try to get on any hype trains these days for anything, the MCU has set a bar that is too high to release a movie that's just ok. I love the visual effects. I honestly think they are some of the best that I have ever seen and they honestly deserve to win an Academy Award for the work they've done. Sam Raimi did an amazing job directing this film and I liked his style and how it gave this movie something that you haven't seen much of in other Marvel movies. I enjoyed all of the efforts from the cast. The action is fun and chaotic, and that's something that you can come to expect in these movies. But I was just underwhelmed by it, and confused at times too. Even trying to keep up with it, I still just felt lost. And not only that I even just started to get a little bored with it. I actually got tired of Scarlet Witch towards the end. The mid and post-credits sequence were all right. I preferred the post-credits one. And that leads me actually to the humor in the movie which honestly wasn't the most forced in my opinion, and it doesn't seem like there was that much either but I didn't really react to that much of it. Only time I really laughed was from a cameo by a certain someone that's probably been revealed because the internet has dumped everything about this movie already onto it. And Marvel didn't help much either with that with the stuff that got out. One thing I definitely have to give this movie though is that it is in no way in my opinion a carbon copy of the first film in my opinion. The darker tone and Raimi's direction do help it to stand apart from the first film. I honestly wouldn't watch it again though. It's got less to do with expectations and more to do with ""I watched it and I just didn't think it was all that"". I felt like it could have been a lot better. It's not a bad movie though."
This is good if we're just talking about entertaining,
A better sequel that Isn't afraid to get strange,"""Doctor Strange In the multiverse of madness"" Is directed by ""Sam Raimi.

It stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Xochitl Gomez, Benedict Wong and Rachel McAdams.

In this MCU film, ""Doctor Strange Is having dreams about a girl who can travel through the multiverse. When he finds out that the girl Is real and Is In danger, he seeks help from ""Wanda"". But he unfortunately discovers that ""Wanda"" has changed for the worst and he pursues on a journey through the multiverse to protect the girl known as 'America Chavez"".

As of writing this, I just saw this film. It was my most anticipated film of the year for a reason. While this film Is flawed, I think It's a great movie to the MCU that's better than the original.

The positives

The plot and characters are brilliantly written. It's different and It shows the MCU Is growing up even more. This film Is creepy and It Isn't afraid to get brutal. This film Is pushing It's PG-13 rating to the limit. ""Wanda"" as the villain was great and her motivations are completely understandable. Her arc ends In a satisfying and emotional way. ""Doctor Strange"" has a similar arc to ""Wanda"". This film focuses on grief and accepting that you can't have everything you want. The relationship with ""Christine Palmer"" Is handled so much better. I actually care about the character now unlike In the first film. ""Cumberbatch"" and ""McAdams"" have chemistry and the relationship Is more believable and fleshed out more. ""America Chavez"" has won me over. I think she Is great. I love her development as a character and her friendship with ""Doctor Strange"". The two actors have plenty of chemistry and It feels like a real friendship. All the acting Is great. The highlight was ""Elizabeth Olsen"". She gives her best performance In the ""MCU"". The cameos were nice to see. There wasn't as many as I thought there was going to be but I was happy with what I saw. The action Is brilliantly done and It holds plenty of emotion. I spoke about the film being creepy and It scares you to the core sometimes. This film makes your heart pound and seeing 'Sam Raimi's"" style of horror added to the mix makes It so much better. The effects are amazing. I saw this In 3D and I think It made the experience even better. The film Is also really funny. The humour Is placed In the right places and the jokes land most of the time.

The negatives

I think the biggest negative Is the pacing. This film Is two hours long and It felt longer. It's annoying because there Isn't a scene that feels out of place but some overstayed their welcome. Some of the cameos don't enhance the story and they have little development. None of them did anything significant apart from one cameo, and even that that character didn't accomplish much. Finally, this Is a spoiler so I won't say what happens. But there was one moment at the start which didn't add anything. It could've added some genuine tension later In the film but It was never used and I think It was a missed opportunity.

Conclusion

I really liked ""Doctor Strange In the multiverse of madness"". The story and characters are Interesting, the actors have plenty of chemistry, the acting Is great, the action Is really entertaining and emotional, the horror elements scare you and the humour lands. But the pacing, underdeveloped fan service and a wasted bit of tension lower the films grade.

I'm going to give ""Doctor Strange In the multiverse of madness"" a:

8/10."
Triple Strange,"Entertaining, suspensefull and unexpected. Doctor Strange goes above and beyond again. And this time he is not alone: a bunch of new and old team mates are there to support him. Great movie! Looking forward to see it again."
Elizabeth Olsen range and genius dominates,"After watching the film, the title slightly off as Wanda Maximoff/ the Scarlett Witch is as central if not moreso than Dr Strange here.

This being said, as expected, the film feels disjointed here and there because of very rapid pacing at times and slow in other parts. Good story through and through and good performance by Cumberbatch, Wong and Gomez, however an amazing performance from Olsen makes this film an exceptional showcase for the actress. In my opinion she should be recognized for it."
Potential wasted,"I'll cut to the chase. I was looking forward to seeing Benedict Cumberbatch unfold his many talents in this film where the theme is multiverse.

I imagined him playing different characters. I think the animation Into the Spider-Verse did it so well.

I was simply hoping for too much.

The film had a ridiculous plot line that wasn't explained enough and that wasn't engaging enough. I didn't feel invested in any of the characters. And the characters that appear briefly seemed more like a joke. We all knew their fate before it happened - it was that predictable.(spoiler alert) And they also managed to make a disappointing mess out of those special appearances. The movie was a real disappointment. I gave the movie 2 stars. 1 for Cumberbatch and one for his amazing cape."
Too much and not enough,
dr. strange in the multiverse of madness,"In my opinion, I felt that the movie was good, although it was not what I was expecting at all. I felt that the expectations for this movie were nowhere near where they went, and I have to admit that I am a little disappointed.

I felt that they brought the hype up too much, and they made it seem like it was going to be something that it was not. In all advertisements that had been shown, the movie looked to be a rollercoaster through the multiverse, and a journey through time itself, whereas that is not what the movie borough forth.

During this film, there were also many scenes with an emotional appeal, which I found to be very well constructed and brought forth a nice feel to the movie. I felt that the added emotion helped to bring down the fast pace, and bring a sense of feeling to the movie, which is important in any movie, but in my opinion, especially in a movie with heavy fast-paced action.

Overall I felt that this movie took on a very different appeal compared to all other previous Marvel films, and it did take a much different direction than I had expected. However, it was still an incredible journey."
Raimi,"I havent really followed much of the new marvel movies, dont really care about marvel or disney or disneys marvel, i watched end game and that was it for me. I watched this because I love Sam Raimi and was great to see his twist on the Dr Strange world, I can see why others didn't like it but if you're a Raimi fan you're pretty much getting Evil Dead Dr Strange and that made me happy."
"No, just no💀","The movie wasn't released and i already witnessed spoilers across the internet. But that's not the reason. Basically caused me to lose interest and all the hype i have for marvel. Idk why, but i just did, sorry."
Sam Raimi is Gold SPOILERS,
Why??,"At first it's worth watching. But you have a multiple universe that could have been better used. Dr. Strange and Wanda are the two best characters at Marvel for me. So they could have been better.

The story is empty and very Poor.

A lot of illogical things.

Missed opportunity."
Failed to meet my expectations,"I was really looking forward to seeing this sequel but found it to be mediocre at best. It was as if Disney replaced their seasoned Marvel writers with traditional Disney writers...goofy!!

Failed to meet the Marvel movie standards that we all love and as such, failed to meet my expectations!"
"Masterpiece,","The acting, cinematography, and the story is masterpiece,idk why so many people expect to see this movie become a absurd movie when every characters from other universe in 1 movie, that make no sense at all, Marvel movies is far better than every other superheroes movie because they build the story, and yeah the title should be dr strange 2."
not what they promoted,
This happens when audience begin to loose sense of good content,"Here you are folks with your wished characters squeezed in without context.

Worst story ever. Script is as lost as strange in the movie.

Didnt like the acting either."
This movie's great!,
Not The Same Standard As Other Marvel Movies,"If you're hoping for a quick witted, smooth dialogue with high standards-you will be utterly let down!

The ""jokes"" that Marvel is known for, DS2 missed the mark terribly! Don't expect the under the breath, brainy, ingenious back and forth between character exchanges that made the Marvel Universe work with other movies! Watching DS2 felt like I was watching a B-rated animated force laugh.

The story line was ok. I believe Disney wants to walk a line to appease certain smaller groups in the US instead of listening to what the majority of their audience wants. We are seeing this with the amount of money the last Spider-Man made. It will be interesting to see how much this makes.

I rated this a 5/10 compared to the standards of Marvel movies."
Multi Mess,"I have to applaud the creators of computer generated visuals! There seems to be no limit to their imagination !

Starting out I felt already overwhelmed with the visuals and action but it being Dr. Strange I continued. It's hard to follow the plot , it jumps here and there, maybe after watching a few times it'll become clearer! The appearances of several beloved marvel characters are a confusing plus but feel like they have been added because of writers block lol! Nevertheless who am I to criticize this film that certainly took a look of work to create and obviously is making oodles of money! So I will watch again hoping to make some sense of the plot! Meanwhile it's just worth watching for the SFXs which are out of this world! Literally 😂"
Just 1 star because of Cumberbatch otherwise just another boring superhero movie in an endless line of such,"Sick and tired of watching superhero movies with special powers based on DC, Marvel etc. Maybe good for young kids and juveniles just discovering their superheroes but I think the rest of us adults are done after watching years and years of an endless parade of superhero movies, which have by now lost the ability to add anything new at all, except show the latest improvements in CGI.

I decided I had had enough when maybe 15 mins into the movie some one eyed octopus-like monster suddenly lands in NYC and starts destroying everything and everybody from out of nowhere, no head or tail, and Dr Strange flies in to save the day.

Really ???

If all these superheroes have such superpowers why can't they try make a movie where they try a hand at solving some real world problems, for a change?

And if they are such superheroes how come they allow such super villains to exist in the first place and not get rid of them ahead of time ? And if these villains are such super villains whose only intent is to destroy then how come they just don't drop a big 100X nuclear bomb and destroy Earth? Why painfully fight the heroes in scene after scene, and then let the hero win after what, exactly 2 hours ?

What's the point? What is the sense of these movies except of course like I said in the beginning for young children just discovering the super hero universe, and for the big movie companies to wring more millions from unthinking masses?

I am done with these senseless action movies, any thinking adult will prefer gripping movies anchored in reality."
So nice I had to SEE TWICE,
An enjoyable jaunt,"Being a long time fan of Sam Rami, this movie didn't fail to deliver. Glad to see him back in the director's seat I can see some being unsure about this movie, especially following on from the Avengers movies, but take it for what it is, a fun filled action movie.

I didn't notice the time go by, which I find is always a good indication of enjoying a movie.

I would say that the need to watch WandaVision is required (Loki series too), otherwise you are left wondering what the Wanda storyline was all about as it was not explained at all really . I have and it certainly helped.

So, if you enjoyed the Marvel series on Disney+ so far, I think you will get more from this movie and enjoy it more too."
Pointless,"Super woke and all over the place. Marvel is starting to lose it with this multiverse tyrade! Other than taking us deeper into a whirlwind of chaos, the only other reason I see this films purpose is to introduce new characters/ play a non sensical nostalgia game. I am pretty sure it's heading to an avengers from one universe vs avengers of another."
Disappointing.,
Quite possibly one of my favourite MCU entries,
A multiversal gimmick that did not work out,"Unlike the previous installments of the MCU which made good use of previous world building in establishing their story, Doctor Strange 2 instead crammed too much new exposition into the movie, making the story so violently overpaced that the audience does not have time to digest, and the end product could only be seen as a forgettable fast-forwarded story with little weight. This is situation is exacerbated by Marvel's attempt in making something new with horror elements and a darker tone, which itself is commendable, yet when mixed with out of tune Marvel humour, purposeless characters and poor editing, this movie can only be seen as an inconsistent multiversal mess that one would hope that a better version exists among the vast realities."
One of the worst marvel movie,
3rd Eye...,"Is the 3rd eye supposed to be an underlying sexual innuendo? Besides that, the movie overall was enjoyable because it did up the ante on previous Marvel movies (to a certain extent!) and hopefully the next phase of their Marvel movie project does bring more than a sentimental vibe."
It was wonderful journey of Multiverse,
Messy yet entertaining,"Sam Raimi was the abosulute perfect choice in for this film his fingerprints are all over the movie from the horror to the visuals to even the cheesy dialogue for better or for worse this was a Raimi fick through and through This was no End game or Ragnarok or No Way He but a solid addition to the MCU Those expecting a multiverse movie might be disappointed but I was happy with what I got

I appreciate how marvel stuck to the Dr strange movie and made it his own as opposed to making it avengers 5 or whatever it genuinely feels like. A sequel to 2016 Doctor Strange

Messy plot with rushed elements but I ahd a great time even if l of it didn't make sense but that's part of the ride and the Trip

I will say one thing tho, that the marketing for MoM and ESPECIALLY the original teaser is kind of (but kind of not) showing. A different movie for again for better or for worse so don't expect what you think you got from the trailsr

Not on my favorite MCU flick but definitely an ENTERTAINING film it was worth the wait ...just not the way you might have wanted."
The reason I don't like Doctor Strange I don't like witchcraft sorcery! It's Forbidden by That I mean You Can't Get Into Heaven Using Or Believeing In This Junk!,Just like there's junk Science this is junk fiction. I don't care to watch it. Better to keep your mind clear of this stuff it has a corrosive effect on your brain your body and your spirit!
The perfect initiation into the multiverse.,Super excited how they will go from here. A perfect setup for the journey that lies ahead. Can't wait to be a part of it. People who are giving a bad rating to this movie were expecting too much. This was the first proper movie and introduction into the multiverse. Need to build up to the hype!
"New perspective for marvel movie, Love it!",
Best one yet!,"Never saw wanda's movies but this one was one's best action to watch, watched with ma girl yesterday and really loved it, can't wait for next dr strange movie to come out..."
Awful......A Marvel Horror,"So Marvel are now delving into the dark world of horror.

This is so far away from the brilliant storytelling of Ironman and the Avengers.

Why change a formula that works so well, that brings audiences back picture after picture.

This I so far away from home....."
Worst Marvel Movie So Far,"Maybe my expectations for Marvel movies are too high at this point. I have loved most of the movies, but the storyline for this one seemed exceptionally lazy."
Wandavision season 2,
"such a pity Benedict Cumberbatch, talent wasted on this",Marvel has turned into a moneymaking gimmick. How dissapointing ~ Half the movie is an advert for random Marvel productions. At the cost of a storyline worth anything at all. Feeling betrayed they abuse a viewer's time and attention.
good SFX and scenes,
All over the place,
People saying movie was a mid really went to just see so called rumours cameos and as all the rumours were not true people are seem to be a little bit disappointed,
Not worth the hype!,
a mess,"Just a bunch o chaotic characters shooting nonsensical dialogues in a nonsensical movie with a stupid script with an unrecognizable directing and anonimous scores.

This is not even a roller coster dear Scorsese. Is just sxxt."
Wanda it s actually the main caracter,
I honestly just wonder who the people are that gave this a 7 or higher are.,"This is actually just garbage. Good concept but did absolutely nothing with it. Alternates between making you laugh at how nonsense, how cringey and how predictable it is. The only value you can get from this movie is going with a friend so you can laugh at how entertainingly bad it is. Or gain some self confidence from realise people are actually dumb enough to enjoy this and you're less mentally impaired than the average bear. It scares me that people can like this film and are able to vote."
Good movie,
Not For Everyone,This is a MCU film and if you don't know what that stands for this might not be the film for you. This is a film for the fans of the marvel universe (multiverse) and would be hard to keep up with no prior knowledge of the plot going into this movie. That aside this movie is still a basic marvel movie with some elements of the directer Sam Raimi really showing through.
Offensive,This is a terrible movie. I had to stop part way through to see if the writer and director had done Marvel before - nope! Not really. This didnt feel like a Marvel at all. I was worried i needed to watch it for continuity but I wish I could burn it from my memory.
"Gee, if only there was more CGI ....","It might be interesting. I just have a hard time with movies that substitute computer graphics for actual acting and directing. La, la, la... Netflix won't allow me to submit a comment that doesn't drag on and on."
What a horrible movie. Lazy writing.,
I only got a headache watching. It was like spells being played out,"Apart from the script being very boring, predictable and flawed, I got a feeling as if they are trying to put ideas into the head with sorcery and black magic while playing a movie about that. Good thing I am not easily impressionable. Don't waste your time and most of all your spirit and mind will be better off not watching this."
Disappointing,"This movie is made for the hardcore MCU fans.

For people like me it makes no sense at all and I wish I could get a refund. The actions of the characters make no sense at all, the bad guy's logic is absurd and the protagonist is not charismatic at all."
Why many people (and I) didn't love it,"I've thought about this for a long while, and I think it's because people expected a truly epic multiverse war movie where Dr. Strange teams up with every 2000s superhero to fight his variant or something. But instead it was about a random book (the darkhold) and Wanda, although she is stanned I feel many people don't really care about her story in the face of a much more epic potential multiverse war story."
Can you call it a Doctor Strange movie?,
So Strange that There was no Strange in it just wanda,"Movie started off nice... Interesting scene ... Intro of new lat chick, okay. Than it's just a mess with plot hole after plot hole. Even in the MCU there needs to be a plot, purpose and if nothing else at least a story.

Here, it's just a woman who wants kids and despite being the most powerful force in the universe wants the babies of someone else.... I mean who wrote this crap ..

The multiverse part is just for laughs ironically... With focus on more female & woke stuff than real storyline..

I'm just happy I saved my money by not watching it in cinemas. Waste of time."
The Good & The Bad,
Lives up to the hype just,"Mixed feeling about this was looking forward to exploring more of the Multiverse, only really went to two.

The first is the most important for me for future Marvel films F4 has found it's Mr R.

The second was more dark and moody but all false into place.

It's a Marvel horror for the realms of What If it had the perfect director for it .

2 end credits scenes worth watching."
The multiverse kills everything marvel,
greatest film to be released by marvel in a longg while,"Great film, ending sucked, wanda lost and 'believing in yourself' gave America powers.wtf. Doctor stranges transformation was and felt rushed, and again, Wanda lost for stupid reason,"
Campy,"The movie itself isn't bad but the tone and directing was all over the place. Just felt like Sam Raimi was a slight letdown on this one.

It has his signature shots of slow or very quick zooms on faces as well as a cameo from Bruce Campbell of course."
An interesting venture,"This film was epic on scale with the cast living up to the task. The premise is a simple yet effective one and it's good to see the interweaving of Disney+ shows and the MCU.

My one criticism is instead of always seeking to achieve the fan-service that Disney thinks will draw in big crowds (worked well with No Way Home in their defence), concentrate on delivering more plot.

We could have seen more of the multiverse, experienced more 'Strange' and enjoyed our time there.

This was a very brisk canter through the Multiverse - at times it felt like a lot of build up to not much pay off given the reasons why - however it was still very enjoyable!"
Dated Raimi-isms & weightless story...,
Waste of time .,"Trash movie for kids,doctor strange one was way better .

This movie is the worst marvel movie .waste of money and time.momy and kids they should rename it as Wanda vision multiverse .

I didn't think it would be this bad."
Leaves a lot to be desired.,
Awesome if you liked Sharknado,This movie is hilarious is you expect to see another boring marvel flick. The plot is so dumb that it turns into a perfect comedy. Basically at every step the protagonists make the worst choice possible for the sake of making the film longer. Had a lot of great laughs.
Scarlet witch the whole movie fighting to get to her kids,
Huge Disappointment...,
"Destroy the Dr. Strange image with the ridiculous 3rd eye, very freaky.","First of all, the first Dr. Strange was one of the best Marvel for us, but since then it has not been the same. This Madness movie was a bit disappointing, it was messy, rushed, horror-like movie, perfect for Halloween, and lost. The actor for the character America Chavez was not needed, weak and didn't fit from the very beginning, they should have picked someone else. I understant Dr. Strange having 3rd eye in the other universe is fine, but to have him seem like it will be permanent into the next future movies is destroying his image, having the 3rd eye with nasty eyeball is freaky and weird, he's too profound to be looking like a freak. I do hope the writers do not put the 3rd eye in the future movies, it basically killed it for me.... And all the violence, it was unnecessary, the director should copy the End Game, you don't see this kind of violence. Overall it was okay, but still love Dr. Strange."
Surprising!,
more Raimi superhero films please!,"Not just because it was directed by Sam Raimi, but I REALLY ENJOYED THIS!

I am a bit of a horror film-addict and this was a good non-scaring film for kids to watch, not to much blood for the younger audience to see but man were there a handful of jump-scares.

Cosmic monster designs (that make me wanna go read the old comics), creepy settings and zombie Strange with the freaky cloak was so cool.

Sherlock did a great performance as he always does and Lizzie played a good and intimidating antagonist...and her witchy-self in this film didn't detract from her being one of my celebrity crushes <3 Also, the music was FANTASTIC! The sound of the chimes and that guitar, OH, it just really made this film seem mystical.

I can't wait to see more of Doctor Strange in future films.

I would give this a watch again!

BRUCE CAMPBELL!!!"
Multi... what,"It is difficult to explain all problems with this movie, but there are two that make it all ok instead of good.

First, I would not be able to explain what is going on in this movie really, because any universe could be whatever you want it to be, there are no rules, logic or causality, the other universe is simply something that is more or less coming out of the blue. Second is that what they want with Wanda is impossible to act to the same level as everything else that is happening around.

WandaVision, for example, was bringing these emotions gradually, here they try to do the same in 5 minutes. Even though we are talking about multiverse(s), some emotional context must be real, but here we do not have that. Elizabeth Olsen as, anybody else, could not pull through empty and more or less nonsensical emotional canvas about being omnipotent loony.

Now if you just try to forget these, you will find it all simply amusing. A new character (named America!?, again, not confusing at all and with a star symbol!? Maybe some future incarnation will explain that she is the multiverse daughter of Captain America or something) coming from nowhere does not help the plot at all.

So, way too many bad points for a rewatch, and I am not sure what they wanted with that ending. To continue a story that is already standing nowhere. I do not think that this will work.

And yeah it is somewhat annoying when they are telling you constantly the rules for some invented technical details over what you can or cannot do within multiverses.

I was not bored to death, but I find it strange that we have so advanced CGI and still have nobody to right a proper story. Every second attempt falters.

It is ok, with popcorns, but there has to be a way these things to be much much better."
It was alright,"I really truly wanted to love this movie, I wanted it to be in my top 5. But it's not it was an alright movie, the first one was better. I really don't have much to say but I didn't fall asleep. I guess you can take that how you want to."
Thank god for Sam Raimi,"Thank you Sam Raimi for this, it has a more dark vibe compared to the last marvel's movies and I totally loved it! It shows a particular attention from the director to the movie in terms of shots, there were some amazing shots and use of cinematic techniques that make this movie a little better than the others (cinematography speaking) Wanda/Scarlett Witch is definitely the best character in my opinion, there's no arguing with that.

Initially I wasn't sure about the cgi in some scenes, it looked like it was kinda of a cheap quality but then, as the movie went on it got better.

Also, If you love crossovers, you'll love it!"
Finally something different in the marvel movies!,Thor ragnarok was different which is a great movie. This was different which is a great movie. I like it when they change it up. Sam raimi thank you for this movie. It was awesome! I didn't care for the new character but that's ok cause the rest of the movie over shadowed that for me and I just ignored that part.
Thats the beat solo movie i ever watched,I like the horro theme on this movie. The wandas maximoff (scarlt witch) power is grate no change between comic and live action characters power.... The horro wibe is grate... i think the illuminate in here is not the original one they are like avengers in another universe original illuminate must ccontain the iron man.... After Spider man no way home this is grater come back.... I enjoyed the movie cuz the good explanation of multiverse and the bring new characters to the mcu..
"If you haven't seen Wandavision, forget it.","If you haven't seen what Wanda did in her own little series then it'll probably be pretty difficult for you to understand what's going on in this movie. Also, this movie is just a lead-up to the next movie so don't expect any fantastic revelations. It is a very action-packed exciting movie although I found it kind of hard to watch as it was redundant in a lot of ways and very obvious what was coming until the very end. Don't forget to watch what happens coming up during the credits! It's STRANGE!"
Incredible Movie and better than the previous one,
Don't Listen to Haters ! This movie is freaking awesome !,
Missed opportunities and descent into obscurity,
"Weak premise, weak movie.","The visual treatments are stunning and the action sequences mind boggling. Some characters are interesting, but it just didn't pull me in. I watched it all the way through, wondering why I was watching. Unfortunately the premise was incredibly weak and just could not carry the movie. Normally I like superhero movies but this one fell short."
The worst Marvel film to date.,
Comment,"I saw it at the cinema today. Really good film, but far from perfect. Continuing Doctor Strange 1 in 2016, this second film brings a different feel, more serious and more horror. The main focus of the film is on Doctor Strange. As a result of his spell, the multiversal world became chaotic. Many new and old characters are introduced. The plot of the story may be a bit disjointed. But the visual cgi offered is truly epic. Sam Raimi brings a new atmosphere to this Marvel film."
Unnecessary indoctrination,"Not the best movie, just an okay Marvel movie. Lowered the rating even more because it includes a lot of unnecessary indoctrination. Instead of focusing on having a good movie they focus on showing the audience what the left considers politically correct."
Not the best not the worst,
Rami makes this film undeniably his own,"The newest entry in the MCU is a modern throwback to mid 2000's superhero films, and is undeniably a Sam Rami movie. His distinctive style presenting itself throughout, in the form of horrific chaos, including zombies, creatures, witches, monsters, and more. Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness was put in a tough spot, shortly following what is quite possibly the greatest multiverse film ever made in Daniels ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"", and of course the shadow left by ""Spider-Man No Way Home"" is present as well. Rami makes this film his own, and was obviously unafraid to take risks throughout. Some decent cinematography, intoxicating visuals, and solid camera work are all occasionally paired alongside the MCU's usual downright bad visual effects and rudimentary camera work, as well as a script filled with poor dialogue and plot holes. The refreshing factor here is that there is at least originality taking place, as well as the obvious presence of the care that Rami and his team put into this production. It certainly isn't perfect, and is quite flawed, but it's a fun time, and has some Intriguing film making happening."
So dissapointed...,"I have been a long time Marvel fan and it became family tradition to go to the cinema whenever a new Marvel movie came out. This time was no different and: I WANT MY 2 HOURS BACK!

Not only was the camera work partially low budget movie like, but so was the acting. While the effects were in true Marvel fashion and good, the acting was mediocre.

Benedict Cumberbatch is a brilliant actor but here he seemed as though he wanted to get it over and done with. While Elizabeth Olsen managed to portrait the crazy as perfect as always. Yet the interaction with them and the special effects...was...lagging. And I don't mean to say that I would do any better in a greenroom, but...I'm not Marvel.

However next to the camera work and the acting the story itself was so dissapointing. It doesn't matter how random or weird everything was and how strange characters were put together. There are plot holes at every 2 minutes of the movie and it felt more like a lowbudget horror movie.

The story itself felt rushed and was explained in the first half hour and starting from then it was one fight after the other. Marvel usually takes it's time with details but it didn't in this one.

I am truly dissapointed and I think we should rethink the family tradition of watching each marvel movie at the cinema. Heaven knows it will be on Disney+ soon anyways and we get to save a lot of money."
I hope this isn't the main MC universe...,
Something fresh for the Marvel universe,"I seriously loved this. No, it didn't really explore the Multiverse as much as we'd hoped, but I was just so engaged by the colours, the camera work, the editing and transitions between scenes. Wanda is obviously my favourite villain of all the Marvel films. Her presence is gripping, the way she solved problems was very creative. All the characters were sort of thinking on their feet, so it didn't feel predictable. Doctor Strange could've done with a more distinctive arc, but he's always fun to watch. I wish this film was like an hour longer! The multiverse is a very fun concept, and I think the way the film ended was very satisfying (thanks to Raimi) but they could've been fleshed out. My only other criticism was that the dialogue was a bit silly, but it doesn't hugely detract from this."
Not the best but FAR away from failure,"It's really good but could have been better . Nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed it and I really liked the fact that they gave Wanda a bit more credit with this film . There were some issues with the plot, I think it wasn't focused enough and lacked a bit of depth (although it had immense potential) . Yet I would recommend watching it because despite its issues it is a must see ."
Not as good as the first,"They're making it harder for the general public. Must've watched wandavision and many other marvel movies to understand the references and insiders (they're not going to fill you in), unlike the first Doctor Strange, where it could've been the first ever marvel movie you've watched and everything was explained, so you can enjoy it.

If you're looking for the first Doctor Strange experience, absolutely not here."
Superb,"Dark, Alluring and Majestic.. Has to be one of the best movies marvel has made.. can't understand the rating here.. this movie has to be right up there in the top 100."
Inception for kids,"It's a great movie if you like watching your favorite famous people move their hands in weird ways to shoot big red CGI orbs at each other during fight scenes. In between those parts, it's a highly convoluted time jumping/universe hopping story centered around Wandavision wanting to see her kids, who have the hilariously uncreative names of Billy and Tommy. The protagonist (who somehow feels like he has second billing to Wanda), Dr. Strange, a time-traveling British guy who is a Doctor who isn't a Doctor Who, is mostly on screen to move his hands, shoot CGI things out of his hands at people, and be sarcastic when he's not asking people questions about what he is supposed to be doing-at one point in an extremely dialogue-heavy expositional scene, he asks John Krasinski how he can get to a book he's looking for that is incredibly crucial to drive the story forward. John Krasinski reminds Strange that he made himself a huge loophole out of like, time warp magic or something that allows him to just get directly to the book, which we never saw onscreen or heard about at any point beforehand. It's just tossed in to bail out whoever wrote themselves into a corner with the screenplay. Dr. Strange is pretty much just like, ""oh yeah, that's right!"" and the movie shamelessly plows forward (it prompted a huge belly laugh from me and is far and away my favorite part of this movie).

There are a number of characters who are important parts in what we will call the story of this movie, but the character development just isn't there for us to buy into any particular motivations or desires that they may or may not express throughout the movie in regards to why they are doing what they are doing onscreen. And for the record, I'm not even referring to all of the Easter eggs and crossovers and cameos peppered in-just the mostly disposed-of side characters who for some reason are given notable significance in a number of scenes in this movie that are clearly meant to be turning points in the story, which fall a bit flat because we don't really care about the people involved. Also, Bruce Campbell is here, because Sam Raimi. If it's any testament to the screenplay and how fast and loose it plays with all of its characters, he is arguably equally as important as, say, the big giant bipedal cow/bull guy or John Krasinski in the grand scheme of this story. There's a lot going on here and to try to keep tabs on all of it is a fools errand. Sit back and let it happen to you. Watch this movie the way you watched movies when you were a little kid. Just watch the big loud fights and the bright colors. Cheer for the good guy even if you don't know why. Doesn't matter.

I can go on and on about this movie and trash it for being a really goofy screenplay and complain about nitpicky issues, but I'm not. That's not the point here. Ultimately, it's just another Marvel product like the shirts and the toys. It's made to appeal to the widest audience as possible, it's very clearly something that's made for children to watch despite some of the darker Sam Raimi horror-ish touches (most are CGI ridiculousness, some of them look really cool in brief flashes), and it succeeds in that department-it's a movie for people who do not think too much about what they're seeing and like to see big loud things happen that look really cool, of which there's a lot here.

If we want to look at what this movie is trying to do creatively with the screenplay, character choices, and storytelling, while also appealing to extremely broad, lowest common denominator blockbuster movie sensibilities, it's probably best summed up as Inception for kids. That's as complimentary as I can possibly be."
I was fully onboard until the music fight.,
"I'm not a monster, I'm a mom",This movie was terrible. So cheesy I couldn't stand it. I don't know how there actors scan show up to work and seriously say some of these lines. Absolutely awful.
Pieces of s...,"Loved the finest one, this was a total waste of time. Never been so bored in my life before....cgi disaster....just dont watch it, ud rather mow the grass twice then watch this again."
worst thing ive ever seen,"This is a ripoff of Deathnote, straight down to the dialogue. When Wanda says ""I am Kira, God of the New World"" it cemented to me that media is no longer willing to stray from the status quo and is just a flat circle when it comes to ideas."
"A bit woke, could have been so much better","The moms scene that adds nothing to the story other than indoctrination. The racially ambiguous main girl. The strongest character is a woman.

The main girl if she was a good actress could've carried this film but unfortunately I think I know why she was hired."
Surprise,"I really like this movie , it continues the story of Wanda Maximoff and Doctor Stephen Strange. It also introduces the new character America Chavez. But this movie is a little bit scary, so you may have nightmares after it ."
The best Marvel movie since End Game!,It's the best Marvel movie since the infinity war end game! You must watch it in IMAX 3D! Definitely! The plot logic is much more better than all the other Marvel movie before! Finally! The fight is amazing in IMAX 3D! Can't wait to watch it again!
What a ride!,Wow. This one's amazing. Sam Raimi takes the helm as director with Danny Elman composing the music. The visual effects are stunning. Superb acting and great filmmaking!
So much hype for nothing...,"Honestly, the best part of the movie was Bruce Campbell.

It was just far too woke for me to give it a genuinely good rating. I just did not enjoy how consistently it was thrown in our faces."
Mediocre at best,"While nothing in the movie is bad - acting, VFX, etc. - it all feels like they tried to cramp as much as possible to satisfy as many types of fans as they could.

Too many characters with no background info (even post-credit scenes have new characters without introduction), unnecessary cameos, weak main villain motivation.

Also, remember when once Disney said we don't need to watch ALL of the Disney+ spin-off series in order to follow MCU films? Well, that was a big lie. I have friends who did not watch WandaVision, What If? And Loki, and were thoroughly confused throughout the film. I guess Disney+ is also suffering from stagnant subscriber growth, eh?

It is a shame as this was one of the most anticipated MCU movies since forever. Especially after the success of the first Doctor Strange movie, which was a genius. No wonder the original director - Scott Derrikson - left. ""Creative differences"" is just a term Disney likes to use when good Directors call out bad scripts.

And, oh, the horror aspect? Well, unless you are a die-hard horror fan and get off by jump-scares, this movie is nothing close to horror.

Probably one of the weakest MCU films, in my humble opinion. I don't know why fans were dissing on The Eternals, which had a much more interesting storyline. Would not watch it again, and probably should've waited for the Disney+ release."
Great movie!,"Trumpsters: Don't go see this. You won't understand it. You won't like it. Stay home and watch Roadhouse again.

Everyone else: Go see this soon and often! It's definitely a gem that does a lot of great things it really smooth and classic ways. Sam Raimi at his absolute best. One of the best superhero movies to date!"
A CINEMATIC MADNESS,"In a post no way home world where the multiverse is on the edge of breaking apart, a magical threat falls upon the MCU. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a film about trust, love, loss, and sacrifice. A heartbreaking story driven by strong motives, delivering an ultimate understanding of how the Multiverse works, while introducing new characters. From the very first second, this movie gives true to life VFX and a score you will not forget that easy. Sam Raimi and Danny Elfman reunite to create a thrilling ride across the Multiverse, full with easter eggs and many doors for countless other movies. Another example of a successful Marvel Formula, but this time with a lot of spice from the master of horror himself. Filmed from start to end in IMAX, this movie is meant to be seen on the biggest screen."
By far the worst Marvel movie.,"Using the word ""multiverse"" seems to have given the directors license to write a plot that made very little sense. Cameo's by more super heroes is not enough to save a terrible plot. Great acting can't save a terrible plot. Pretty sure they said ""multiverse"" more often than Smurf's do in a Smurf movie."
Sam Rami saved this film,There is just enough sam Rami to turn this into a fun earnest gore fest. But not enough to make the films much better than average. Has enough entertaining and surprising moments to make it worth seeing. But lots of clunky ones as well.
madness has begun in MCU,"This was a wild journey, and a epic entry in mcu from the goat sam raimi, i honestly had no complain with the run time of the movie was perfectly fine with me :) there were few things in movie when i was like: you know what? You could've done that but regardless i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i think most fans will too! The horror element is real not gonna lie."
"Perfect Story, Perfectly placed characters","Marvel Always finds a way to connect the Stories. Perfectly casted and great story. Really like the concept of the movie. Never heard of this comics superhero and have never even seen the trailer before I watched this film. But I came out of the cinema totally entertained (as expected of a Marvel movie) and, surprisingly, spiritually uplifted and inspired. You can strip back the mind blowing effects."
"Squandered Potential, Underwhelming","The movie started off well with amazing visuals, and really captivated and immersed me into the multiverse but the thrill decreases and decreases along with my immersion as the story progresses but still with momentary enjoyment here and there.

Wanda's power usage is very inconsistent with at times having way too much power and then dumbing her down soon after to create plot armor for important characters.

Wanda's actions in Wanda Vision considered to be Justified is absolutely ridiculous.(She literally went crazy evil in WandaVision. WOkE ig) .

How they dealt with the Illuminati was INSULTING to say the least. What a letdown for the audience and a disrespect to those characters.

Mordo was a downright terribly written character for the movie.

By the end of the movie I was completely out of the narrative.

Good acting for the most part, with excellent cgi but I did not feel the horror as much as I wanted to.

Script needed a significant revamp without a doubt. Many dialogues were very very out of place and cringy to say the least.

Overall I would say it's worth watching ONCE in the Theatre just for the visuals. Don't expect a good story, nor jump scares nor a fruitful use of cameos."
Absolutely Brilliant!!,"Loved every minute of this movie, it was exactly what it said on the tin...it was crazy, amazing action, great story, Wanda was probably the stand out for me.....oh and definitely wait until the end of the credits.."
Superhero or sorcery?,"I enjoyed most of this film. I was someone letdown that Wanda Vision was who she was in this show. Didn't really make for a good plot. The part that really got me is all the sorcery, I thought this was a super hero movie. The violence was also over the top and unnecessary. If this is the way Marvel is going with there movies, I'm out."
Too much is still good enough,"It was a good movie - worth watching. However, it suffered a little from being overstuffed with ideas. The cameos are worth watching it alone. Sam Rami's imprint is all over the movie - so if you like him, you'll love the movie."
What is this ?,"The plot is trash, the overall is trash, the cgi look like a video game, the acting was good. This movie is rush in the ending. MCU phase 4 is boring. Like No Way Home is too much fan service. People are just blind because of the nostalgia."
Dissappointment at so many levels,Felt like story/script was written by a kid. Very weak plot. Marvel movies in this phase are becoming more like kid's fairytale. Better title for this movie would have been 'Witch vs Wizard: Battle of magics'.
One of the best movies ever made.,One of the best movies ever made. Marvel is gifting us with best movies. I will suggest every movie lover to watch this movie. And it is also like a horror movie.
No I expect more,"Sam raimi, after hearing this I thought this will be the best marvel movie but it's the darkest MCU film ever made but don't expect too much than visual effects, music and acting. Disappointed."
Multiverse of Madness in the producer's heads.,
Its like.........,....all the characters seem to wander onto the screen and dithered about wondering what they should be doing....and then they sort of acted out some random stuff that then the movies 'about'....so basically non enlightening stuff with nowhere near enough madness or multiversing....just kinda definitely STRANGE and rather empty of story line or point......or plot.....but I still love Dr Strange! And will remain hopeful that the next one has some meat to it!
Simpsons did it better 30 years ago,"There is a 5 minute Treehouse of Horror episode that has more multiverses, more madness, and more creativity than this movie delivered. Would have loved to see commitment to the ""multiverse of madness"" portion of the title, but it seemed the writers and director thought the audience would be awed by 2 multiverses.

Aside from the failure to show multiverses or madness, this movie gives us an unfocused plot, fan service sloppily woven together, and inconsistencies both with itself and other MCU content.

There were some nice visual spectacles and a couple decent one-liners. That's about 0.05% of a 2 hour movie. The rest of it was pretty painful. Maybe if you're expectations are low enough you can get some enjoyment out of this one."
Stunning,"Visually stunning, loved it. About story I'm not sure but if you'll watch it you'll be satisfied great action film with a pinch of horror. I will recommend you to watch it in IMAX 3D for the best experience you're gonna love it."
Not Enough Wanda Vs illuminati Fight scenes,"Love the whole story but the movie happening so fast and the runtime didnt enough for me.

Especially the fight Scenes happened so fast and absolutely not enough! So Marvel please release the original cut."
Could've been a breakthrough for Marvel...,"Multiverse of Madness is an extremely mediocre movie. The movie is directed by the epic Sam Raimi, except it doesn't feel like he actually directed it. There's certainly numerous of Raimi-esk scenes with violence, physical comedy, and Bruce Campbell. The music fight with evil Strange is one of the funnest Marvel fight scenes ever. And the montage with different multiverses is a great sequence. And it's delightful to see Bruce Campbell. However, nothing else other than those small moments feel like the movie is directed by Raimi. In fact, the rest of the movie feels like just another PG-13 Marvel movie. Sam Raimi is the only reason this movie is decent.

Another main problem is the writing. Wanda and America Chavez are supposed to be essential characters. But yet, they don't feel like real characters. For instance, the only time you get a glimpse at America's feelings is during the flashback of her mothers. Other than that, America is a plot device, same applies for Wanda. Wanda is a being of pure evil in this movie. At the end of WandaVision, it seems like she accepted reality. But in this movie she's slaughtering everyone in order to spend time with her children. Unlike the desperate ""mother"" from WandaVision, she's now a shallow and poorly written plot device. The Darkhold just feels like an excuse for lack of proper character development. The Illuminati in the movie is just here for fan service. But the characters don't live long enough for the audience to actually like or know them.

This is not the best Marvel movie. But it does push forward the plot of MCU. It could've been a way better movie if it had more style and better writing."
"Good, but was overhyped by Marvel","Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is overall a good movie. It's especially the darkest and violent movie Marvel has made so far; the acting by Elizebeth Olsen was amazing who gave her best performance as the Scarlet Witch. However despite the risk taking and good performances, the movie suffered on its lack of delivering a big action packed adventure as promised. I was disappointed on the slow pace during spots, and felt the multiverse was next explored as it should have. Some the action was amazing, and needed to throw in some pore action packed scenes that would have made the movie a lot more fun, and helped the pacing."
Bruce Campbell Sucks,"I am so sick of all the cliche Raimi trademarks he has to hamfistedly shoehorn into every single thing he does. His directing style is so tired and should have been retired after evil dead 1. The one good thing he's ever done was an interview on the Plan 9 companion documentary.

And Bruce Campbell is not funny ever and is distracting.

The stellar cast really saved this movie though."
Quite agree this is a Wanda movie.,
"Great movie, but the middle/last credit scenes are AMAZING",
I exepcted more but its fine,"This film has sooo hype thats the reason of low ratings its not a huge film it just a part 2 for doctor strange so i love this film as a sequel for doctor strange this film has many pros and cons the story is good and better than Spider-Man no way home and wanda was amzing but if this film was 2h45m it was a perfection and the pacing of the film was too long

Overall i loved this film its not great but very good."
Go watch it for yourself,
Madness Journey!!!!,"Multiverse of Madness is thoroughly enjoyable, with sam raimi ramping up the horror elements with his trademark style (There is definitely one grossout scene you'll know it when you see it.) cumberbatch wong and McAdams are all very good but elizabeth olsen honestly carries the film tthe story has some very inventive plotting but leaden dialogue at times tends to let the side down visually impressive too (as per for recent marvel studios films) And yes there is very good reason why Marvel want to keep a tight lid on spoilers with a humorous PSA before the film proper seriously between the Illuminati and the post credits scene ""See it as soon as you can!"""
Headed Down The Wrong Path,This movie does all it can to entertain the viewer but falls short is sense and actually making the movie feel like it has any stakes. The multiverse concept in the MCU has been acted out correctly in Spider-Man and Loki but Dr. Strange can't seem to make it as good as the others. The movie also relies on the viewer having watched Wanda Vision and other sub par marvel TV shows. It can't work as a standalone film and even so it still isn't that great.
Generic Marvel,
I've seen 5 bad movies and this was 4 of them,
Illogical but Entertaining,"You're going to need to check your brain out more for this than the usual Marvel movie. There are many, many logical inconsistencies and nonsensical developments throughout the movie. It's obviously a Disney feature, where they care a lot more about how a scene or moment feels than they do about whether it makes any sense.

However, the fact that we're dealing with magic that follows an arbitrary set of rules unknow to the viewers helps lessen some of the frustration. This makes it easier to ignore some of the silliness and just enjoy the flow of the visuals and action. Which is good, because that stuff is quite entertaining.

Still, the feel-good moral ending is extremely weak. Even for a Disney feature centered around a young girl.

If you want to see some cool spells and fan service with lots of action scenes and beautiful art, go see it. If you want a logical treatment of alternate realities, magic, known characters, physics, rational motivations... or really anything, you might skip it."
Closest to a true comic book movie we've gotten,I tried really hard to avoid spoilers and didn't watch trailers and im glad that I did. I was very excited and genuinely surprised by everything that happened. This introduces soo many comic book concepts in 1 movie that this might be overwhelmed for the casual movie mcu fan but as a comic book reader I was very excited. There's soo many great things in this movie. Is it perfect? No but im glad that they took these risks.
A good film but Marvel made us expect more,
Almost perfect !,
long. too much talking and vanilla action.,"I prefer the more comedic and epic-scene-filled marvel movies. This movie felt way too long and the action and attempts at being funny were horrible. It wasn't for me, but that doesn't mean it was horrible."
Marvel let me down,"I would like to start off by saying that I'm not a marvel hater. It hurts me to give a movie I wanted to love a okay at best rating. My love of the first doctor strange left me really looking forward to the sequel and it fell short.

Let's start positive with the pros, because there needed to be something good for me to give it a six. The effects were well done from a technical standpoint and the music wasn't bad. As I expected from doctor strange, there are some ""trippy"" visuals that didn't disappoint.

Then too the cons. There are a lot of cons.

To start off with, the move tried to do too many things. Hazily waltzing from one scene to the next resulted in a loss for attachment to the characters, the villain or their motivations. The moments that were supposed to have me emotional for the character felt manufactured and glossed over as the only real reason to care for them, while the villains motivations had me let down."
Looked like Carrie,"I thought I was watching the horror flick Carrie from some of the scenes, not enough storyline and weak plot. Very Disappointed, since I love the first Doctor Strange. It was very convoluted and really never caught on before you went another way. Hopefully the next one will get better, but I think too much of Hollywood wants to put politics innuendos into the movies to appease everyone."
So silly and ridiculous....🤣🤣🤣,"With that plot they could have turn this into something epic, dark, mysterious, mad, wild , fun and beautiful instead it was incredibly silly and laughable.

There were moments that the movie could have gone a different route and really blew us away but the script was so poor and the constantly disssapointing ..

this said, Benedict Cumberbatch and the amazing cast did everything they could to save this movie from its own mad silliness. 5 beautiful stats for that amazing man who plays multiple Stranges with amazing dedication and passion. Cumberbatch and the amazing top cast is undeniably the only reason this movie is half watchable..."
X-men?,
The Multimess Of Messiness,"This was another MCU movie I was looking forward to seeing since Andrew and Toby's comeback in SNWH......

THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS turned into a dredge of disorder from cameo's for 5 minutes and then killed off to where is this actually going?.

I have a feeling Sam Raimi was severely limited here in the type of movie he wanted to do thanks to Disney and Kevin Feige to turn what should be a dark story and R-Rated into another cookie cutter PG fest but atleast Bruce Campbell had his 2 minutes and is still alive.

Reminded me of Spider-Man 3 2007, could have been great but hampered by BS cameo's to appease fans by the studio and running off the coat tails of the previous spider-man movie.....sounds familiar."
Ridiculous,"What a pile of rubbish. Not made for children who would find it difficult to understand. As an adult, it was a stupid plot for the sake of cameos. Or maybe they're a redefining ways of reviving other failing Marvel comic franchises."
This is the sequel to Doctor Strange,"Ultimately, people seem to hate this movie because it doesn't contain all the leaked cameos they were hoping for. They seem to want more multiverse than they want Doctor Strange himself. No matter what, this is his film. This is a sequel to Doctor Strange. This is not the ""what if...?"" Movie. This movie is spectacular in its own right. If they want to see the marvel multiverse, watch ""What if...?"" Or read the comics."
"Marvel has become obsessed with itself,","It cannot even write a proper story, it just references itself in an endless loop, trying to please fans, making bland jokes, sacrificing good dialogue, good actresses and actors, engaging stories, nice emotions, just for the sake of saying 'it's me'.

I've would've loved a more profound treatment of the madness and horror aspect of the movie, it would have made it truly stand out. DS1 is in every aspect better."
Plot is too contrived,"Doctor Strange 2 suffers from a convoluted and contrived plot. This makes it hard to care about what is happening. The only real element the viewer can latch on to emotionally is the relationship between Strange and Christine, but there is too little of that. Wanda's motivation to get to her kids is dumb because her kids already have a Wanda mother in another universe. To have any hope of following this movie, I recommend viewing the first Doctor Strange movie and the WandaVision TV series."
It's Wanda show not Doctor strange,
Worst Marvel film to date,"Other than a few surprise reveals, there is nothing good about this movie.

Terrible story, bad acting, and visuals that were laughably bad at times. The opening scene looks like CGI from the mid 2000's.

Surprised Marvel passed this movie through."
"I enjoyed it, I liked it, I didn't love it.",
An America Problem,
Tripppppppyyyyyy,"This is a stellar movie. Not sure why anyone would give it less than 10. Are you not entertained?

What is the point of a movie, if not to tell a story which spans multiple dimensions, pits sorcery against witchcraft, exposes the emptiness and incompleteness of our individual souls, and does so with over the top CGI?

Seriously, how could everybody not be entertained by this movie? Smoke some weed or something. You know I did."
"Too much CGI, too little interesting story, nothing retains","Much to artificial and much much much too much realy artificial looking childish colorful CGI (on loads of unicorn-sugar).


Too little story, lots of too long connecting-scenes with non relating content
Nothing, that will retain this thing in my mind as something good to remember.


No, thanks, but no thanks. It could have been so much more, but Dr. Strange - a promising figure with a superb actor - just got burried with a unmotivated realisation of a storyplot, unnecesary and boring scenes and truly bad CGI..."
Please don't take ur child to this movie,
"Decent, if predictable movie",
Without doubt it is the best one,The cgi was perfect actors were amazing and good story and it was scary enough ! There is noting to say about it. The multivers was not complicated and it was fine.
Unbelievably entertaining,"This movie just kept on giving, it really takes you on a fun bumpy and low key scary ride across the multiverse, the visuals are beautiful and I could still feel the adrenaline on my way home.

Beautifully done, different from all the others yes, but still very worthy."
"Too Much Madness, Less Multiverse, Promoting Illuminati and Third Eye",
Underwhelming,
A Mess Within a Mess,
Things Did Not Get Out of Hand,"A few surprises, a few laughs, some gasping moments. Overall the movie was just okay. I was intrigued the entire way through, however the movie had a very lackluster ending. Not much of a cliffhanger either. The movie had edge of your seat action, but it was missing that memorable moment that the best of their movies have. We've been very spoiled by the quality of Marvel content as of late, especially with No Way Home so they did set a very high bar for themselves on this one. It's still a very good movie for the die hard marvel fans out there, but don't expect that ""I gotta go back and watch it again"" feeling."
Not the greatest. But watch anyway.,"The movie was alright. I do like the visuals, but I felt that it lacks something special. I guess my expectation was quite high. I wish there's more in-depth story about America. At some point I was thinking that this is becoming a horror movie."
"Awesome, Adventure, CGI and VFX level is high.","Story is best, I never boarded while watching Madness really it is Multiverse Of Madness. I will give this movie for 10/10. Acting Best, Action Best, BGM Best."
Midtiverse of Misses,
Sucks for Wanda fans,
The premise doesn't work,"The premise that the film is based on as a starting point doesn't work. In my opinion, this ruins the entire film. The film itself is not that good. Hopelessly overloaded and too jumbled, illogical. The sidekick, who still played a good role in the first part, has been neutered. Not quite as bad as Hulk and Thor in infinity was and endgame, admittedly. But his part was drastically devalued. That's a shame, because he's a sympathetic character. Without the hopelessly ""unrealistic"" premise, the film would be a 6/10 for me. But as I like to say, a film must at least stay true to itself and follow its own rules within its unrealistic universe, and this film does not. Therefore, the thing is a 3/10 at most."
Wanda's madness,"Graphic , VFX undoubtedly at its best as u expect from Marvel.

Unexpected role and performance by Wanda.

Expected more of fight from illuminati. But was good to see some old folks back in MCU.

Two post credit scene so wait till last 😁😂"
"Now, This is what we came for!",
"Well, it's makes a great Halloween Movie","I did not expect the movie to be as spooky as it was, nor did I expect it to be as violent as it was. The cast and crew did a phenomenal job illustrating intense action sequences. I would enjoy watching this movie during the Halloween season. Other than that, my praise for the movie subsides.

I cannot imagine going into this movie as a newcomer to the MCU. It is filled to the brim with Marvel Easter eggs, character drops, and references. I got a thrill from all of these things because I understood and appreciated them. However, if you are new to the MCU, you are at a disadvantage; that includes understanding the backstories leading up to this movie's plot.

As I mentioned earlier that it is more violent than I expected, it pushes the limit of its PG-13 rating. Compared to all of Marvels previous films, this one obviously stands out for its gore. I highly recommend parental guidance or viewer discretion. It is action-packed with every fight scene becoming a spectacle, but this movie only survived because of these (along with all the character introductions and references). To be honest, the plot is weak and predictable with cheesy lines recurring every few minutes. Not to mention, the gay parents that served no purpose to the plot. There was real opportunity here that was left out. Speaking as of right now, they were merely added to be inclusive to a certain population of viewers. Perhaps in another stand alone film the parents will actual effect the plot. If they advanced this plot in any way, then I would not be bagging on them.

I did not have high or low expectations and I am usually a generous reviewer but this movie simply does not excite me enough to rewatch it anytime soon. In fact, this movie seems familiar as if I already saw it. If you want to know what I mean, I suggest watching What If...? Season 1, Episode 4 ""What if... Doctor Strange Lost His Heart Instead if His Hands?"" for a similar but much better version of this movie's plot."
I don't know why ppl are complaining here,"It's a very good movie that is full of surprises. The director did a good job integrating the zombie horror and superpower together. It's a good piece of art work. There are many forms of film art out there. It does not always have to be deep or soul touching. This is a movie that brings you happiness and relax, A movie that you can walk into the theater on a Friday's evening and enjoy a fun time with your friends."
BEST MARVEL MOVIE IMO,Simply fantastic for so many reasons! The horror. The BRUTAL fight scenes. WANDA! Spectacular movie! Elizabeth Olsen is perfect in her portrayal of The Scarlet Witch!
Best movie in the mcu,"Dumb mcu kids hating on this film, rami has showed you how to make an actual movie and not a low effort soulless superhero film with the exact same plot as the last."
I don't understand how many fall for this crap,"There were many moments in the film where i felt it was made to entertain kids who are still in their very novice stages of building maturity. Probably many ratings here are from those kids. Adults might have considered it a waste of time to even rate this movie. The graphics & visuals are good though, but the crew should think at what cost!!"
Don't let Sam Raimi direct any more superhero movies!,"This was a boring parade of clichés. I've watched almost all MCU movies, so I was expecting something monumental, mind-blowing. Instead they presented a predictable, boring, unimaginative story and some poor acting, but even more the embarrassing directing from Sam Raimi. And of course an unnecessary Bruce Campbell."
"Spectacular Production, but a generally Dark Depressing Story","The special effects and production values are excellent. The story falls short of the first Dr Strange which really pulled me into the excitement of the story. The new movie seems to just pile on misery and destruction. I know many will disagree, but I do not like the increasingly dark and dismal atmosphere of the Marvel movies. What happened to the wonder and hope? I was looking forward to this film, but was disappointed."
"Good, but could've been better",
Everything Is ok but,Everything Is ok but it has fine visual effects and storyline but the only thing our expectations was high for the cameos and This was disappointing. You have to change this movie name to dr strange vs wanda i think multiverse of madness was just for attention.
For the Raimi fans,"The only problem I see with this film is that : 1- it's a MCU movie and 2- it's owned by Disney. I chose to not care about either and decided to watch for the only reason I could find this film worthy, which is of course Sam Raimi's unique style of directing. I love this man with all my heart, he's a cinematic treasure, and I had a total blast watching this. The 8/10 score is for Raimi, not Marvel or the film with and its flaws. Also, where was Ivan?"
"Decent acting, MCU gone pathetically offensive...","From the pathetic attempt at virtue signaling with ""two moms"" to the extremely offensive and borderline domestic terroristic symbolism represented in the form of that pathetic pin America wears, this movie has seemingly little to do with the MCU and more to do with an underhanded attempt at normalizing delusion. The multiverse theory is just science fiction brought to the forefront to try to move past the perceived shortcomings of being forced to acknowledge reality. The creators of this movie should have stuck to the tried and true MCU formula instead of spilling a magic bucket of primordial crap to try and make up for horrible screenwriting and lackluster imagination. The MCU as it once existed is the explosive charge that propelled the firework that seemed to be building to and amazing spectacle, that gave intense expectation of an amazing climax at some point, how high will it go? We don't know. This movie is the cheap and horrible let down, the failure of a not so sparkly report that is the ultimate letdown at the finale that everybody knew was possible."
Best movie to watch,"The only problem in this movie is the time it's only 2 hours thats lead to fast action if they made the movie around 2 hours and 30 minutes or a little more it will better but i love it because I don't love long movies, the acting was perfect Elizabeth and Benedict did a spectacular job and don't forget the director Sam who did a great job.

Note: this was the most horror marvel movie ever."
Tragic Story Writing,
Good,I like it a lot and elizabeth olsen is a queen. I only expect more cameos that dissapoints me a lot. 150 karaktere tamamlamak icin yazdigim abuk sabuk seylere hos geldiniz.
BANG Average like most og The mcu,"Watched this movie 2 times today and i had a empty feeling after both times. Almost non stop action wich is not my cup of tea. The movie did not take it tile with som slow scenes with character development. Dr strange i feel is The exact same character now as he was in infinity war. The best part if this movie was Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda, great performance. Not a bad movie, but not perfect."
Not like any Marvel movie so far,"Visually amazing, unlike any Marvel movie I've seen so far, great action, really good new character introduction, Elizabeth Olson just WOW, Sam Raimi has made a movie you should go and see. However, I didn't love it, I felt like something was missing that meant it didn't immediately fly in to my top Marvel movies. Still definitely worth seeing though."
Too much madness. Not enough Doctor Strange.,
Very disappointing,
Kind of disappointed,
Suspension of disbelief necessary,
Should've been a 10,"Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is another solid entry in the MCU, However it was quite underwhelming for what it was hyped up to be. From the trailers a fan speculation I thought this movie was going to be a deep dive into the weirdness and craziness of the MCU multiverse. It turned out to be more of introduction into the Multiverse rather then a deep dive. Now this isn't marvels fault as the fans heavily drove the narrative that this movie would be an groundbreaking MCU event. It's just disappointing that a movie called the ""Multiverse of Madness ""barley explored the multiverse. Another thing disappoint about this film is Dr. Strange has the least interesting storyline in this movie. Wandas and America Chavez both have infinitely better character arcs then strange does. In terms of plot Dr. Strange gets outplayed by both his supporting cast which sucks because Dr. Strange has been such a good supporting character and now he finally has a chance to shine as a lead and didn't deliver. All though Strange's Story is rather uninteresting he's just as badass and ignorant as before. The way he uses magic in this movie is so creative and so top teir . My final main criticism of this movie is that it didn't commit to the horror vibe it was originally going to have. If plot that is fairly dark the tone of the movie didn't properly match it. You can see the horror elements all over this movie but the movie doesn't embrace this. It was like there was a tug of war if the movie wanted to be upbeat and uplifting or if it wouldn't to be dark and horror. If they would've fully did not even a horror movie but kept the dark tone from start to finish, we are looking at 9-10 teir movie without a doubt. Even with the criticism this movie is not bad or horrible. It does have prolly my favorite cameo/introduction of a character in the mcu and is very bloody. Wanda continues to prove why she is one of the greatest characters in the MCU with another amazing performance but At the end of the day this movie wasn't as great as it should've been."
It's both extremely good and extremely bad.,
A Captavating Story that will be leave you chilled,Doctor Strange In the Multiverse of Madness doesn't go into its Multiverse concept as much as I wanted too but I really liked how this was the first time where the MCU has genuine Horror as Sam Rami Promised which I really loved. I will say that this and No Way Home are just dips in to Multiverse. And this More feels like a the proper conclusion to WandaVision that we all wanted back when it came out seeing her struggles and conflicts and I will say this movie is getting overhyped to seeing who may show up to where you may feel disappointment at the end but you have to realize the mcu is building towards that there is so many movies left in this in this phase for them to go all out with just this one so overall this is a good marvel movie but don't walk in expecting every single marvel character to show up where there are some cameos to get the crowd howling but there isn't gonna be as much as people are expecting.
A pretty small Multiverse,
It was madness alright,
From a non Marvel fan,I went to this movie for my kids with no expectations. Expected a no brainer version of multiverse and a CGI fest. Got exactly that and some interesting twists and good performance. Overall a better than average Marvel.
Strange Indeed,"Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness review-

Pros: Unique & Scary. Unlike all the other MCU films this one is by far the darkest. It has horror-like elements and actually more similar to films like Venom & Morbius, if you've seen those. Even though there are some parts that didn't need to be in here it had some fun jump out of your seat moments. I actually loved that aspect!

Acting. The acting in this film is actually pretty great. Wanda was definitely a scene stealer but Benedict Cumberbatch has some great moments too. It's been cool to watch these characters evolve and change a lot over the years, not just stay the same. Marvel's MCU films are starting to blend together so this was one that was different from the rest.

Cameos. I won't give anything away in the review but some rumored cameos ended up being true (and some not) so that part was definitely a surprise. It was nice to see some familiar faces along with some new ones! Although as you will see if you watch the film fan were left wanting WAY more.

Cons: Corny & confusing at times. Some of the horror elements ended up being cheesy in a strange way (see what I did there!). There are also moments I did not understand what was going on with the storyline and I was a tad bored. Like any superhero film, some characters don't make it and you honestly don't know why. It was very much of a let down in that regard.

Spiritually dark. We all know Wanda is also a witch (in a superhero way) and Doctor Strange is a wizard. Their powers come from fictional magic not necessarily classic witchcraft, but in this film they play with darker magic and even demons. A lot of of their scenes involve them surrounded by candles (seance style) in a more classic witchcraft less superhero setup. From a Christian perspective this movie isn't ANYTHING to glorify or appreciate. I didn't not like that. It made me a little happy to see that this wasn't top ""Marvel magic"" when it comes to their film ratings.

Not on the same level. For some reason this movie seemed more like a Disney Plus show not a movie. The budget seemed cheap and the storyline seemed unprofessional and cluttered, not their best. Don't get me wrong I love the director Sam Raimi but he needs to stick with Spider-Man, that or brush up on his script writing again.

Although it wasn't peak Marvel, it wasn't a failure. 7/10."
Dissapointing..,"Could be a LOT better. But God knows when Marvel will work more on their films besides to do vfx and just another ""epic"" plot. So much money, so many people working on projects.. i understand that u do 1000 films rn to make more money asap but pls a good effort of producers - it will be very very decent and not just ""ahh one more marvel movie"""
Not much good as expected but overall great experience,
"First half Yay, Second half Nay","Movie stars - Yay and loaded with great and famous actors

Plot - Yay has potential to be a great superhero movie

Directing - Nah but if you enjoy zombies movies, you might like? That's what the Director is known for, so it makes sense why he directed that way, but I don't like it as it's not really a superhero movie to me. It's like horror + goofy + superhero

Editing - Nah kind of bad tbh

Music - Nah some like action movies or cartoons style."
DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS Writer Explains Why The Movie Didn't Introduce Mutants,"Heading into Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, it's fair to say fans had a lot of lofty expectations. Unfortunately, many of those didn't become a reality, potentially explaining why many feel disappointed by the blockbuster. We obviously got some high-profile cameos, but, like Eternals, the Doctor Strange sequel failed to add mutants to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Wanda Maximoff has a lot of history with mutants in the comic books, of course, and even removed the powers of millions of them during the House of M storyline. With that in mind, you'd think there might be a way for the Scarlet Witch to bring them into the MCU, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron explained why that didn't happen while talking to ET Online. Yeah, we talked about House of M, and there's plenty of examples of Wanda doing bad things throughout the comics in an effort to get her kids back,"" he explained. ""But ultimately this story didn't need mutants to be powerful, I guess was our feeling. And, you know, wherever that lies on the timeline for the MCU, it didn't feel like this was the right place to introduce it. Then it suddenly would have just been about mutants, Waldron continued. And this is really a story about Wanda and her grief and her descent into darkness in this movie."
Second favorite film in Phase 4,This movie left some ground not covered however some superb acting led by Elizabeth Olsen really carries this film. I would say this one is 2nd best of Phase 4 behind No Way Home. Seeing Dr Strange vs Scarlett Witch was for sure epic.
"Marvel does Horror, and does it well!","Ever since goddamn Spider-Man broke the multiverse, I knew we were in for a hell of a ride in this next phase of the Marvel franchise.

Doctor strange has never been my favourite of the Marvel superheroes, but I've been excited for this film as it takes a different direction into the horror genre.

After the huge success of Wandavision, I'm glad Elizabeth Olsen gets to reprise her role as Wanda/The Scarlet Witch. She does such a good job of portraying someone so angry whilst in so much pain.

The set designs and locations are incredible as always, as are the costumes and special effects.

Some surprising cameos and plenty of shocking and scary moments to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film. The musical symphony fight between the Doctors was clever and original and one of the best scenes in my opinion.

I'm really hoping Wand returns, and with the Marvel universe, anything is possible!"
I dont liked very much its indiscriminate to Marvel Studios,"Behind the first movie, it has a very shallow subject, the character richness is very weak, the action parts are unpleasant, our new character takes place too much, but it is a very average movie with a weak contribution to the movie. After the trailer, the parts that we are excited about are very simple and do not excite us, they pass very quickly in the movie. Frankly, as someone who watched the first movie from time to time, I didn't know if I would watch this movie even for the second time.

As long as you keep giving high marks to this type of movies, you will continue to get pregnant with bad works like Venom and Spider-man No Way Home. Unfortunately, you will see quality works like Avengers Infinite War 1 in 30 movies.

Do you think it was processed with the right of the Illuminati in the movie? Scenes set for landing. There were scenes that showed neither depth nor the power of a formation. It ended in 3-5 minutes.

It was said multiverse (Don't laugh), what did we see? While passing between dimensions, 10 pictures of the Very Happy Trailer were not included in the movie.

My last recommendation is movie tickets between 65-85 TL. And bad movies should be called bad. These are not small sums.

While it doesn't have a quality finale, like the Batman movie, it makes more sense to recommend good works."
One Wild Ride,"Doctor Strange 2 is one wild ride that treads unfamiliar waters in the MCU. It's bold original, fun and eventful, fresh and colorful, mesmerizing and suspenseful, and just a joy to experience in theaters, especially IMAX 3D. This was made for that format, and it was made well. Sam Raimi's creative direction paired with Danny Elfman's creative score packs a punch in this sequel, and it may come off as ""strange"" to many. This is why being creative and unique can be risky and inevitably appeal to everyone very differently. But in the Multiverse of Madness, it was extremely fitting. And I loved it.

Kevin Feige knew what he was doing when he gave Sam Raimi the freedom to make this movie as he sees it, versus following the flatter, kid-friendly formula in previous MCU films. Just like Thor Ragnarok was a Taika Waititi movie, just like Captain America: Winter Soldier was a Russo Brothers movie, just like CA: The First Avenger was a Joe Johnston movie, just like Iron Man 1 & 2 were Jon Favreau movies, etc... this was a Sam Raimi movie. And if you enjoy the suspenseful horror-comedy of the Evil Dead trilogy, along with the stylish action-adventure of the Spider-Man trilogy, then you will certainly enjoy this film. It has scenes that have never been created before in the MCU, which now spans over a decade. That's quite an accomplishment to do. As we've seen in the newer MCU films like Captain Marvel, Black Widow, and The Eternals, they've become more stale, boring, and unoriginal to the mass audience. To better put it, quite uninteresting. But Shang-Chi, No Way Home, and now Multiverse of Madness have regained that exciting, unexpected, action-filled adventures and expanded the cinematic universe entirely - to the point that people go a bit too far in expectations now that the traditional rules of what we were used to for many years have officially broken for the better. Thor: Love and Thunder will surely continue in this direction, and that is why people are being more drawn to these movies even in the fallout of the Avengers.

This movie rewards those who have seen WandaVision and What If. For those who haven't, it certainly may be a bit weird and random. But nevertheless, the story has been well thought-out. As for the writing... maybe not as well as people would've liked. For the criticisms on the writing or plot, or perhaps the lack of a bigger and more anticipated scope of the multiverse, that falls on the writer and Marvel producers. With a screenplay written by the creator of the Loki series, it does have its moments of ""eh."" But it's nothing that bad and pretty easy to look past, considering every recent MCU movie has its meh moments. Could it have utilized a better writer for a movie this grand? I would have to agree. This film also underwent a big change following the replacement of the director for the first Doctor Strange. On top of the reshoots and COVID-cautious production, as well as the mandatory connections placed for linkage to the other Marvel content, Sam Raimi could only do so much. But for those who would not enjoy both Raimi's style and Marvel's plot structure, it makes perfect sense to dislike this movie. However, that does not mean the movie is bad just because it is different or not fan-service enough.

The crowd I sat with in the theater reacted a lot in fun ways. Cheering, clapping, laughing, gasps, and silence. That's what good movies do. I was blown away, and I would definitely watch this again and again. It's one of my favorite MCU movies. I strongly recommend IMAX 3D or any format similar for the best experience. The way you watch this movie makes a big difference. You'll want loud sound, pumping bass, 3D-popping visuals, and a full screen. It's quite the treat.

No Way Home was only the beginning. The Multiverse of Madness leaped even bigger. More of the unknown will follow as revealed by the post-credits."
"""If you knew there was a universe you could be happy in, wouldn't you want to go back there?""","It saddens me that such a visual tour de force like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has what feels like a computer-generated screenplay.

The new Sam Raimi feature film is definitly filled to the tip of its toes with Raimi's signature style, but unfortunately that wasn't enough to make this a great movie. It's one of those hollywood productions where it feels like everyone envolved was extremely confused with what to do with it, which resulted in a big stir fry of uncompleted ideas that had a lot of potential.

Raimi's love for the horror genre is definitly here and of that I can't complain. Absolutlely adored every single build-up of suspense, every single close-up and every single scream and, oh boy, that Danny Elffman's score was a thing of beauty. It's also worth mentioning the fact that this movie is the first MCU movie that has mild gore scenes in it and though I'm happy with that, I just wished Disney had the balls to release a full-on massacre, gore-packed, bloody, R-rated project.

Besides the amazing visuals and the brilliant artistic vision of Sam Raimi, we aren't left with much. We're left with shallow characters who make unjustified decisions and a script that is filled with plot conviniences and bad, formulaic jokes, but then again not even the world's mightiest movie director could overcome the impact of a money-grubbing company.

At the end of the day I'm just glad this feels like a Sam Raimi movie and that Elisabeth Olsen was here to kick ass."
Completely Average,"Did Marvel die with Endgame? If it wasn't for the special effects and long standing love-in with the Marvel brand it would be hard to give it a 5+. It's becoming increasingly hard to invest into the characters, I mean.. can someone explain why America Chavez tunnel portal is a star? Like the star we draw in middle school..? The live action films are becoming hard to differentiate from their comic counterparts. I legitimately enjoyed Marvels 'What If..?' series more than I did Multiverse of Madness which says a lot."
i want my scarlet witch back 😭,"She is just a mother not a monster 😭 i love her in every universe😍

oh and Doctor strange you are so good looking for more like this..

just enjoy the show and leave your brain behind don't take it seriously just relax if you dont like it then walk away."
Pretty great movie,
High expectations but failed on many levels.,"The only MCU film I did not enjoy. This movie is a betrayal of the characters, the story, and the preceding arcs. Insipid and trite resolution. It is a beautiful movie and contains some good moments but overall leaves you wanting a different story altogether."
Beautiful and spectacular but .....,"Marvel's latest film was not what it should have been and did not live up to expectations, but it is not so bad that some critics say do not expect a lot of actors. The film was good in terms of directing and the special effects were not bad. He was great in the role of Strange and the rest of the cast. The story was good but not great, but the downside of the movie was its fast rhythm, and the movie ended very quickly, thanks to Disney and Marvel. Lastly, if you're a fan of superhero movies, Marvel's latest movie is fun, but if not, it's nothing for you. 9 points for Marvel fans and 6 points for ordinary people. I hope there will be a version called the director version of the film. If you agree, everyone will publish this in cyberspace so that the director version of the film will come."
Your average marvel movie,"Movie has its ups and downs , acting, filming, cameos and cgi are a plus . But after no way home and batman , u can easily see the difference in quality . Story is a bit lack luster , characters become smart and dumb randomly when the movie demands it . + The end credit scenes are worthless and dont mean or reveal anything , dont waste ur time staying for them ."
Crazy but good,"The most believable villain in recent years. I won't give it away, but you know the MCU, you can agree, that this is a totally believable villain. There are some rumors not this thing that did not come true - No Tom Cruise, No Deadpool - but it is still a great movie other fun surprises."
Just bad:(,"I dont know what i happening with movies these days! This one is just bad, story absolutely boring, just a waste of movie. Probably one of the worst marvel movies, just hope Thor will not follow this one... think its time for Dr Strange to retire and no more movies like this. And i am a big fan of all movies that marvel made in 20 years..."
"Creativity was nice, I enjoyed the movie.","The movie was an exciting movie, but did have a lot more darkness and violence than you'd think would be in a Marvel movie. Other than the darkness and violence, there wasn't too bad of language and no sex/nudity which is good."
Fantasy,"Really Good Movie with animation.

I really enjoyed this movie.

Waiting for next level..

Well done,..

done done done done great great great

Good Good Good Good Good."
Terrible,
Title Justified with Mind Boggling Visuals,
"Not the producer's fault, it's just our expectation too high","After I watched very amazing movie of spiderman : no way home, then I put very high expectation on dr strange... but very sad I did it too high haha... everyone's been waiting this dr strange 2 just like when we waited the avenger's end game.. but maybe it was not the time yet..."
Are you Happy ?,"This movie is a work of art. A deepen glimpse into Steven Strange and an open to the multiverse. A confrontation with Scarlet witch and introduction to a new character.

It mixes well horror genra with fantastic and marvel touch. The visual are mind blowing and there is also a good surprises through the different mcu movies and even ""what if...""

There was a cringy moment as always with 90's movie code with overplay, old stuff and sometimes old fashioned... but as Agent coulson said "" People just might need 'a little old fashioned "" .

This movie is a brillant continuity of Wanda vision touch as well.

The fight, the plot, the tone. It goes trought good until the finale where i drop a tear and have goosebumps. The layer behind that madness is a profound yet simple question asked: Are you Happy ?

The multiverse is metaphorical for something deeper and it's up to you to see the reflection of life in art that is presented to you by this movie, witch for me was powerful."
My favorite horror superhero movie,"Thanks to Sam Raimi for making this movie into one of the most enjoyable horror superhero movie. As a MCU franchise, it felt fresh and new and I love this approach. I'm glad Marvel didn't choose the route of making this movie into a cameo fiesta. It was pleasantly adequate. Instead, they focused on the story line. Please keep Scarlet Witch for more MCU projects in the future!"
This movie sucks,Now i can say marvel universe is dead this movie is so boring to me Not like other marvel movies so hope marvel universe will be back like past Actually this movie sucks the ending is pretty good but this movie is very bad.
Awesome,This movie never slowed down. An absolute masterpiece. I loved how they wove together other marvel projects like Wanda Vision and the the highly entertaining What if Series.
The worst Marvel movie I've ever seen,
Raimi Returns and Brings the Madness,"Let's start with a little bookkeeping as it were. I don't know about other countries, but here in the US do yourself a favor and make sure you're in your seat and settled down by the time the trailers start (never ceases to amaze me the number of people that miss the trailers coming in late). Why? Going by Cinemark's showings, trust me. You DON'T want to miss the exclusive first look on the big screen of ""Top Gun Maverick."" My need for speed watching it took every ounce of restraint I could muster not to scream with excitement and stay in my seat. So glad I've already got my ticket. Second, in addition to many of the trailers you can currently see on my page we get to see the official first trailer for ""Avatar: The Way of Water"". Not a great deal of info in terms of story, but visually it looks stunning.

Moving on.

""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" doesn't mess around. You're thrown into the story as soon as the Marvel open finishes playing. So, it's an immediate snap to attention with the who, what, where, and whys of the film. A bit of a shock, but thankfully so. Given the magnitude of what the film is supposed to do both in and of itself as well as the MCU overall, I've been anxious about the mere two-hour and six-minute running time. It seems like a short time to accomplish its goals and also be entertaining. I admit sitting in the theater, ""DSitMoM"" feels longer than a couple of hours. Happily, in this case that's a good thing. The film felt neither rushed nor lagged.

Good pacing throughout.

Lots of action-packed moments from start to finish expertly interwoven with character development and exposition keeps the film moving and engaging.

""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" also does something that Marvel does best. Bringing back actors/characters from previous outings (love seeing not only primaries but also second and even third tier folks return) for continuity but also in new and exciting ways as well. Plus bringing in new characters that serve/enrich the story and get to shine even if they don't last long. I do feel a bit shortchanged on Xochitl Gomez's American Chavez character/back story although I'm sure moving forward that will be rectified. And of course, there are also others that I'm excited will no doubt be seen again as well. Again, an impressive balancing act of making sure characters film don't come off as throwaways and nothing more.

Also thumbs up for rewarding those of us that are current in our Marvel viewings without making the inaccessible to those that aren't. So yes, if you've seen ""WandaVision"", ""What If..."", ""Loki"", and ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" in addition to the Phase I - III Marvel films, you're definitely going to be rewarded. If you haven't, why not? Seriously, why? But still, no worries, you won't be left in the dark.

Speaking of dark, for those that feel Marvel films aren't dark enough, here ya go. Having Sam Raimi as director pays off in my book. Marvel has done a wonderful job letting its films/shows have their own individual style, tone, and ""feel"". One of the strongest aspects in their productions. ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" definitely feels like a Sam Raimi production and has its own unique flavor. Heavy on the horror and easily one of the most violent of the MCU films, it's ""The Evil Dead"" meets ""Doctor Strange"", and it works. While this won't play for some, meaning ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" won't necessarily be a fan favorite, I'm glad to say I was one of the many in the theater cheering, ooohing, aaaahing, and ewwwwing.

Dark, creepy, and fun with a superhero twist!

Not surprisingly fantastic visual effects, wonderful acting, terrific Danny Elfman score, a nice smattering of humor. There's a ton of stuff to unpack in this film so I'm sure that future repeat viewings as well as time to ""sit"" with the film will color my perceptions, but as of now ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" does an amazing job thrilling, entertaining, and packs an emotional punch I found lacking in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" for instance.

Sam Raimi and company hit their mark.

It's a 9.5 from me.

And yes, there are two credit scenes in the film. For those with small bladders or didn't pace yourself for the trailers and credits, hold it long enough to see the first scene at least."
See Marvel,Space Balls Now!
Visual Festival,"A Visual Marvel Entertainment ,nothing else nothing more ! You have to lower your expectations from the trailer or you may disappointed ! You can see Sam Raimi distinctive touch all over it, some may won't like it and some may love it .

Actions and visuals are spectacular and some fights are innovative and impressive !

Scarlet Witch and Stephen Strange SHOW -that is DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS is all about !!

NOTE : you must have to watch or understand the story of wanda wision tv series before watching this one .!

Go for it if you looking for pure visual festival to Enjoy It in Big screen !"
Horror Strange,"Wow. All the time i was just like "" what is happening "" . Madness for sure. I think we should not criticise this based on the other films but as a different approach marvel movie with horror elements. It reminded me a little bit of rick and morty when it comes to the craziness of the different universes ."
About That Incursion Scene,
Some nice new ideas and good try,
"Please, Raimi, don't ever do another superhero movie again...","... it seems you don't get it!

I really feel sorry for all the great actors involved in this film. They did their best, but the script, the direction and the concept of the film (if there was one) screwed them up.

Doctor Strange is one of my favorite characters, and it pains me deeply how ridiculous and embarrassing this film has become.

I will now try to forget about it, and hopefully it didn't do any lasting damage to the MCU..."
I coulnd't ask more from this movie,"It had everything- drama, action scenes, fun moments, great characters and uniqueness.

I went with little expectation to the cinema, didn't see any trailer or plot- just saw an ad and previously saw most of the Marvel movies.

Well, it was awesome! Kept me at the edge and didn't even felt how 2 hours passed. It was really full of new directions and while certain tropes were present, they werent overused- just the right amount to give you sth to hold on for the more madness that came afterwards.

I was a little bit let down by the new character, but both of the Benedicts, Rachel Addams and Olsen were doing a great job."
"I just have no words to express how fabulous, amazing, breathtaking and awesome movie it is.","It is beyond my expectations and imaginations. MARVEL OWNS THE HOLLYWOOD! WHAT A MOVIE for those who did not watch, you will bever ever regret it so please go for it. Still I am confused how Top Gun Maverick made more money than this awesome movie. Anyways loved it from the beginning to the end. It just takes you into another world, it takes you into the Multiverse 🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Not for kids.,"The story, plotting, cinematography everything is perfect not a regular marvel movie. Children may not enjoy but adults understand better. BGM is well played, pure natural effects in fights, Completely it gives you the vibe of SAM RAIMI."
"Missed some expectations, but good film","Didn't really have that many cameos as hinted, but it was a really good film. The storytelling and visuals were great that's undeniable. Though I will say that this film might not sky rocket as it could have only because this doctor strange film had a lot of untapped potential that it didn't tap into. Many Marvel film fans might even experience a little disappointment as far as cameos and expectations leading them to question what's next.. and will it be good... personally though I feel the marketing didn't do a great job only because this movie wasn't as insane as they were making it out to be, but in all it was a great movie."
Watch it to make your own opinion.,"Had a few people before going in they didn't like it. So I was worried. This movie is a hard PG-13 this one honestly is the closest thing I've seen to being almost a R. It's not for sex or anything like that. There are some intense scenes. I cant say why but if I did it would ruin the movie. Go in and watch it with your own thoughts. Me personally from acting , too pace, and other things I just can't say. I can't recommend it enough. For me it's my new favorite Marvel movie but it's not for the reasons others would think. It's something you just need to watch."
This movie is the worst of all time,
Wandavison episode 10,"Sam Raimi took advantage of His experience AND knowledge to put it in a Marvel movie, un this case un Doctor Strange 2,everything works very well AND stands out but it feels like a special episode wandavison but it does not mean that Is it a mistake if on contrary very good but litle is really was disastrous for the fans."
Nothing like the old days,"Is it me or everything went to hell without Stan? Now every Marvel product under the Disney franchise is worst than the one before it. What a poor develop of characters. The storyline is ridiculous, full of inconsistency and no sense variants."
Digital Chaos.,"Overall entertaining and enjoyable but the excessive use of wild graphics, which seems to be the modern trend, a repeating theme, sketchy acting and a weak plot spoiled it for me. Thanks for the heads up that Charlese Theron is in the next one. I'll skip it and see another movie."
What a MESS,
Boring and predictable,"It's not even entertaining to watch. It's not that bad, but it's not good either. I've seen a lot of movies from Marvel, some are good that is why I expect from this. There's a lot of loopholes in this film. The actors are good but not the plot."
Disappointed! Had high expectations for this movie after Spider-Man no way home.,"Over all acting 6.5

Benedict Cumberbatch acting 7

Elizabeth Olsen acting 7

Supporting cast acting 5

After Spider-Man with the whole multiverse thing. I was expecting Dr. Strange to be better. It got worse with no explanation how the multiverse really works and they just jump into different multiverse. Why not bring Toby McGuires Spider-Man into this movie. Story wasn't that great. They have butchered Wanda's character. There was a lot of action and a lot of mess. With no one to clean up after. They just ran all the action scene without focusing on the story line. Never was a fan of Dr. Strange movies and this is the reason why. Benedict Cumberbatch is a really good actor and has played Dr. Strange really well. But this movie didn't work for me. Maybe he should hang up his cape and ending Dr. Strange for good. Wanda's character movie was so bad in this movie. I don't mean bad as a villain. It just sucked.

Not recommended!!"
The movie was dark and fun,"Good movie but a little bit disappointed since it did not lean that much into multiverse after all. It's more Madness than multiverse. It's essentially just a follow-up to Wanda Vision dressed with Sami Raimi easter eggs everywhere. But good nevertheless. I liked Cumberbatch's performance as the different Strange's. It definitely seems like he had the most fun making this movie. Elisabeth also had a great performance. She absolutely carries her character in this movie. The actress that played America Chavez was great. I can't wait to see her future in the MCU. Other things I liked were the Illuminati cameos and the magic fight scenes.

Now the things I didn't like:

My biggest problem with this movie is the story.

The pacing of the movie was all over the place for me

I don't know why they were rushing like the movie could have clearly used more runtime

This was my most anticipated movie of the year and it brought together my two favorite characters of the MCU but it could have been much more than it was.

I feel like too much was shown in the trailers. There weren't many surprises after that.

Overall 7.5/10."
Great visuals but lacked a good storyline,
Spoilers. Fantastic movie.,
Fantastic!,"Absolutely fantastic movie, good range of genre's. Acting from Elizabeth is second to none. My second favourite MCU movie behind endgame.

This movie tests the limit of a 12A rating but stays the right side of the line in my opinion."
Well Directed Awesome Movie,
"Another fail - this is ""content"" not a movie","I once viewed an overdeveloped house, clearly this house was designed to tick all the estate agent boxes but in the process of turning closets into shower rooms, adding rooms and staircases to the attic conversion, including every possible trend and fashion the resulting house was a confusing, shambling mess that you didn't want to be in a minute longer than necessary.

Doctor strange in the multiverse of madness is the movie equivalent of that house, a shambling confusing mess of a film. A 2 bedroom mid terrace with a swimming pool, gym, recording studio and elevator, but nowhere to sit down.

Your pre-teens might like this film they can dip into it 10 minutes at a time watch some fancy visual FX then go do something else like kids do. For everyone else this is clearly not a film it is merely ""content"".

If you want to watch a marvel superhero film just rewatch the earlier ones made by marvel when little things like story, script, character development, logical consistency and ending actually mattered."
Doctor strange geting darker.,I saw the movie twice and is very good movie. Sam rami put his signature. Nice story And it continues after Wanda vision and spiderman. Multiverse is here and it will blow are minds. I thing something good is build-up. If you are fun of mcu you will love this movie.
Sam Raimi is Back,"Welcome back for Sam Raimi after he direct Spiderman 3, he make the best he can but it not as i expected. Plot is Flat and only Horror (not horror like conjuring ftw) can give me some excited to watch.

Sorry but, like another solo movie MCU, Dr Strange multiverse of madness is Mediocre and Nothing special (include 2 Post Credit)"
Great COMIC BOOK movie,"People who say

Plot was convoluted: The comics are always interwoven insane plots, if you don't like it go watch Iron Man 1 or some average slow paced drama. The convoluted plot makes sense if you know your Marvel Comics.

Wanda was too much in this film: Dr Strange and Wanda are togther in the comics, and both their stories are as much as each other.

Too much horror: You're an MCU fan, your taste is generic.

Wanda's character was undone from Wandavision: That's Feige's fault and the terrible team that wrote Wanda into a redeemable character. That's a team of writers, who didn't understand the comic versions, probably the same people like you complaining about it.

This is a comic book movie. Villains, Anti-villains and good guys to into villains and come back. If you want a generic plot of point a to b, go watch something that's not comic book based.

Most of you have a hard time understanding why this movie made a billion dollars and consider it good movie. It's because it has flaire, it's entertaining, it's a pop corn thriller and it's basically what comic book fans want.

If you want down to earth, run of the mill garbage, go watch a Netflix show or Law and Order.

The only fault on this entire journey, is how Wanda's bad side is not properly explained and how quick she turns. That's all on Marvel's side, but that's basically because they hire terrible writers for their TV shows.

The Loki writer is the exception The most viewed and popular show on D+

The writer for Wanda vision is the writers from LOKI, so I'm pretty sure they have the best writer for the job, you're just too confused to understand the plot points. You're not rick and morty enough."
How can Scarlett Witch be this powerful?,"I'm really confused,why suddenly Scarlett Witch became a completely villian ,and how come she became so powerful, totally different from what's like in the Avengers, do you guys remember Avengers? So she suddenly became the most powerful and almighty,it's like she can take every one with the flick of finger. Don't you remember how excruciating the heroes fought in the Avengers movie?? And this abrupt power upgrade just left every avenger look like a joke. I was confused the whole time. This plot is too weak and too contrived. I love the actors and Doctor Strange 1 is just great. If the producers don't have a good script,why bother to make a movie? Such a disappointment."
Great movie but obvious plagiarism,"The movie itself is great but I was taken straight out of the wonder when I saw the musical battle idea taken straight from Sword of Symphony, an independent game concept which is starting to get attention but has now been robbed of its creativity.

Very poor move on Disneys part as it is so blatant and possibly ruining an independent artists future as so much work is now on the verge of being discredited."
Not even a 1% of what if !,"This is very disappointing series ! The single episode of What If showing Dr Strange is better than this entire movie ! The multiverse concept is worst and should've learnt something from Spiderverse movies ! Wanda Wanda Wanda , everything was Wanda ..... Extra characters was like a joke ! Black bolt , prof x was a big joke ! Pathetic !"
Jumping off the MCU ride...,
disappointed,"Whenever you are starting to get immersed in this movie the movie throws a random 1 liner, wink, bad dialog or illogical.move (even when considering its marvel universe) which completely.breaks your immersion and you are back at the square 1. Looking around in the cinema I noticed same disappointed glances from the other audiences.

The worst part was the ""horror"" moments, It made 0 sense in this movie and had only negative impact on my experience.

Overall as a massive dr stange fan I felt let down by his performance (not as an actor) and since his name is the title of the movie its going to be 3/10 from me."
"Not Marvel Studios Best, but not their worst","The action is what you would expect from a Marvel movie and the acting was superb, unfortunately the story was not that interesting. The crossover to bring over other Marvel characters into the story was overreaching and at times laughable. And, once again Disney brings in the LBTQ element when it's not necessary to the story other than to check off a box to appease a social/political group. Go into this movie with low to medium expectations and you'll be okay."
I Enjoyed The First One...,"....do, I was hoping this one would've been as good or better.

I liked Benedict Cumberbatch, Rachel McAdams,Benedict Wong, Elizabeth Olsen and Xóchitl Gómez. I didn't like what they had to work with.

It was tedious, overly busy, convoluted and dragged..... I like seeing the alternate heroes, especially Anson Mount as Black Bolt, even if for a minute.

The worst part of this is reading a review that resorts to vulgarity:""assgarbage""? Do yourself a favor. Move out of your mother's basement."
Not enough conections to no way home.,"There should have been more connections to Spiderman no way home. Even a little bit would have been good. There were not enough ""what if"" scenes in this. The few versions of Doc Stange were a bit colorless. The 7 for the real few high lights like Patrick Stewart."
Raimi show,
one of the worst MCU movies,"The movie had no story and was rushed without knowing suddenly they are fighting, it was boring mostly only few good scenes, not muc story and the whole *** was not needed tbh cause it didnt add anything to the story, not worth watching in the cinema tbh just watch it in home whenever you're bored."
Better than the first movie,
Still unsure,"This film I feel could've been so much better. The graphics are excellent, storyline isn't too bad although imo it just doesn't quite click...alot of the story seems abit pointless, and given they're opening the multiverse it's very fixed on one story line.....one that doesn't really make much sense to me. Some of the CGi is questionable for a marvel film and I think they could've explored one of the main characters back story....again something that didn't make sense.

All just abit disappointing for me."
Dr Lames in the Multi-nurse of Badness,
Great,"Definitely a great movie.it was better than expected, there was a lot more horror and violence than expected and i loved the cameos, but there is some pacing issues at the end of the movie but still a great watch."
A rollercoaster of fun and heartbreak,
Only Watch If you are fan of Superhero movies,
lol,Really sad to see that a talent like B. Cumberbatch is being wasted away on such horsedung. This opinion coming from someone who thought the first movie was OK.
Doctor Strange in the multiverse of wokeness,"The main character is a lesbian Latin-American LGBTQ+ with 2 moms and no dad, they go to a backwards reality so all the super heros are all female versions of themselves except captain marvel since she was already female instead of being backwards and being a man she just turns into a black chick because you wouldn't wanna add more white men characters than you have to. There is some cool set piece moments and some cool action scenes. Also a whole lot of cringe twords the ending and a very bad cgi eyeball. Ok popcorn flick but not near the top of Marvel movies."
What on earth,"This movie assumes you've watched the disney spin off series! If you haven't it makes pretty much no sense. Stupid move! Rubbish movie, I think this may well be the worst Marvel film to date."
Bit hard to follow at times,"Might be different if you read the comics or a hardcore fan of the Marvel Studios series of movies.

But as a casual fan, it jumps around a little much, and adds so many characters with little to no explanation.

With that aside, it's an entertaining movie. Just wish I could leave my brain completely off to enjoy it more."
Really??!!,
What are you watching??,It was baddddd like really badddd. It wasn't enticing at all. It certainly didn't live up to the hype. The story was straightforward but nothing special. Scarlett Witch did take it to a whole other level but that was expected. It just didn't do it for me at least.
Good movie with a ... err... strange pacing,"I keep hearing about how a lot of people won't enjoy this movie unless they are super into comics.

Well, I might have read 1 Doctor Strange comic and a couple Scarlet Witch comics. And I still enjoyed it quite a lot.

The pacing is very strange, specially at the beginning, but I can easily see what they were going for. Contrary to what some other people commented, I didn't find it confusing. I also didn't find any of the ""horror"" people said Raimi put on the movie. At all. Then again, I finished reading the Remembrance of Earth's Past book series a couple weeks ago, so my definition of horror and terror changed quite a lot.

The movie was very different than anything else in the MCU, which is a good change of pace. And so I don't disagree with everyone else, I too found it to be very comicbook-y.

The only problem I've found was that the story became totally predictable after about 15 minutes. That, however, didn't stop me from enjoying the movie. Specially the acting. Elizabeth Olsen was simply amazing. John Krasinski was a nice surprise, which I won't spoil with comments.

The mid-credit scene got me really excited. I can't wait for what is to come."
Bad storyline,"The storyline is bad, it's a continuation off of the latest Spider Man so they forced themselves into a bit. The storyline is bad enough to the point to where the actors don't even know how to buy in."
Best marvel movie ever,Movie was mind blowing in every 5 min you will definitely get goosebumps the horror element was superb the direction the vfx and story all was perfect.
"Good ideas, but...","I was expecting more. To keep it spoiler free: The pacing was off, it rushes when it could hold a bit and stalls when it could go faster.

But the thing that annoys me the most in a story (any medium) is when characters change their psychological profile without a strong motivation. In my opinion this kind of issue started with the multiple TV series from Disney +. I think the MCU got a bit lost in Phase 4 and is hurrying somewhere without building a strong base before. I hope they organize things and decide to walk the path before getting to the destination."
Demonic,
Dr Strange and the Multiverse of Mediocrity,"I think I liked this one a little more than the first but the first one was also pretty ""meh"". They add to character development by giving backstories and giving the audience their perspectives as to why they're the way they are. The movie does have a bit of a dark theme which is captured well by the cinematography and director. There are, however, some moments/writing that make the film a bit cheesy in overall quality which seems to be the direction that the MCU is heading now. They seem to be becoming content with making movies that are essentially just ""ok""."
It's ok.,"All the actors were fine. The special effects were good. The score was really good. I'm just disappointed in the script. It was very cliché (not the normal Marvel humor). It was very predictable. When Dr Strange says ""Me too, kid, Me too"" I felt that has been a very overused line in too many movies. But the worst part is, that I was able to predict the whole movie. I wasn't excited about the ending, because I knew the ending in my head. It was somewhat boring."
Takes risks,The film can sometimes be a chaotic mix of multiple different ideas that don't exactly gel that well together but it still deserves lots of creditor taking those risks in the first place while still being visually striking/refreshing.
"Creepy, Humorless, Empty Shell of a Movie","Absolutely nothing like previous Marvel movies. This movie is horrible. First, the story is creepy and poorly told, with no internal consistency or logic to the characters' actions. Second, the characters are empty shells - the director successfully shredded several characters that the MCU had been building up for years. The main new character is entirely forgettable and has a backstory as deep as a puddle. Third, the ""humor"" in the movie (which was rare to begin with) wasn't clever or witty - it was bland and predictable.

It was like a bunch of middle schoolers were assigned to write a horror movie using MCU characters, and no one reviewed or revised the scripts, and Disney just picked a random script out of a hat and produced it.

Also, the movie relied heavily on using cheap, unnecessary jump-scares. Seriously, what the heck was with the jump-scares? Whose idea was that? Did they think they were being clever? Even good horror movies don't rely on jump-scares!

This Doctor Strange monstrosity of a movie makes earlier less-than-perfect Marvel movies (like Iron Man 3 or Captain Marvel) look like all-time classics. This film is childish and shallow, and I feel ripped off for having paid money to watch it."
For as great as Wandavision was.....,
Mind Blowing Story,"This Movie Is A Very Interesting Movie.

Forgot About The Cameos This Is A Great Movieee

Elizabeth Olsen Acting Was Superb MCU Need To Use Chavez Character After This She Is Freaking Awsome

And The Music Was Superb I Love It But I Wish That X men , Ghost Rider , Dare Devil Came To MCU .

Please Let That Happen Marvel."
Fail,"Personally a horror director shouldn't direct an Marvel movie. Wanda as the villain, story goes from left to right. Love marvel, hate this one.

Feels like ideas were made up while shooting."
What happened when someone doesn't understand what his doing,
"Well, somehow, it missed the mark..","I can't believe that I am giving less than 10/10 to a marvel movie. I watched this movie in 'First Day, First Show' of 6 am, only to be somewhat disappointed.

""I have watched each and every episode of Agents of SHIELD, Iron Fist and Luke Cage also"" - This sentence is enough to prove that I am a MCU Fanboy. But, to be honest, I can not give more than 5/10 to this movie.

Reasons: First and the most important, KLPD. It is an Indian slang, google it.

Marvel hyped the movie by deliberately hinting about 'some' characters, they shamelessly showed glimpses of them, just to make us speculate, talked about it and get psyched. And what happened with all that foreplay, is the definition of KLPD.

(Btw, well played marvel. We were fools to think that 'yessss, I found that small detail in the trailer, that visual, that voice. Now I know what's gonna come.'. We never thought that marvel would not leak anything important. N if it has been seen, it will not be important.)

Second: Story, action sequences and VFX- they are the three pillars in which most of the marvel movies stand tall. Unfortunately, in this movie, the story just one line, ""A wants something from B and C is hellbent to stop it"". And actual action sequences are short and non-appealing. VFX is top-notch, btw. But overall, we leave the theatre wanting some more.

Third: The impression given was, this would be follow up of last scene of Spiderman: No Way Home. I mean, I expected to see how does Dr. Strange deal with aftermath of that movie. But instead, this movie is ""Wanda Vision sequel (minus Vision) feat. Dr Strange"". I mean, Multiverse and resultant Madness was more in Spiderman: No Way Home. In this movie, they merely pass through a few universes."
Mediocre Marvel film,"Especially coming right after the very well crafted Spider-Man: No Way Home movie, the second Doctor Strange pales in comparison. A very formulaic plot, a disappointing introduction of multiverse characters from previous Marvel franchises, and almost no space for humor or character interaction in this constant stream of CGI action. We already know that Marvel is good in huge CGI battles and other visuals. Put the focus more on storytelling and character development."
Bad,"I always had some issues with MCU films but now they aren't even entertaining? Oh Raimi, what a disappointment. The plot is weak, but the script is also very erroneous with some strange and unexplainable writing decisions. The filming is bad and very backwards from how people fall or hit their heads and pass out."
Hide yo kids,The movie was great. People complain about the pacing of the movie but honestly just pay attention and you won't miss a thing. Action packed and will keep you on your toes. Without giving too much all I have to say is WANDA!!!.
A THRILLING master piece,"I loved this film from start to finish.

Given the material and his background, Raimi was the perfect choice to direct this film. His unique style & direction truly helped this movie stand out.

Between Doctor Strange's chaotic world/humor along with the Scarlet Witch's darkness, Raimi didn't hold back and delivered one of the most unique and stylized MCU movies we've gotten in a long time.

The horror & gore were well used without taking things too far.

THIS is the Scarlet Witch so many of us die-hard fans have been waiting for. Elizabeth Olsen absolutely crushed it every moment she was on screen. You could feel her pain, loss and suffering. A perfect example of character growth over the years. She was a true threat with clear motivations from start to finish.

The cinematography was fantastic and fit within Raimi's style which blended beautifully with the madness and horror going on-screen.

The story was straight forward without being overly complicated or too confusing. All of the characters had clear motivations and arch's. There wasn't a moment where I was bored or lost interest.

I recommend watching ""WandaVision"", ""Avengers Infinity War/End Game"", and ""What If"" before seeing this film, if possible.

""Multiverse of Madness"" was self contained - to where you didn't have to watch the others for it to make sense. Although, if you watch the other films/shows - you'll only appreciate the film more.

You could tell Raimi was a Marvel fan - he adapted a lot from the comics that we haven't seen before on screen. One example is Strange's powers. Some of which worked well translating from comic to screen but there was some powers that did not translate well and felt ungrounded.

My only criticism of this film is the overuse of CGI, particularly with the powers. (Felt a lot like Green Lantern at times) We as the audience can suspend our disbelief to a degree but also can tell when something looks off or just downright not believable in the slightest. There were a lot of creatures which you could believe in a sense but the cartoony powers in addition to fighting them, just didn't work.

The cameos were fantastic - fit within the story and paid homage to Marvel fans without taking away from the story nor needing to watch anything else in order for their presence to be understood. (And special treats for fans of Raimi's other works)

Overall 9/10. Would love to see more stylized MCU films from other directors and more of Rami's other visions in future MCU films."
"Lack of a proper ""Villian""","There're many thing or maybe most of thing about this movie which is good. This movie changes our views about Marvel and show us something that we've never seen in any Marvel movies. But the only thing where it lack is not having a villain in the movie, and because of this story line kinda look like incomplete. Cinematography is in the next level, and definitely worth to watch and it's kinda suggestions that please don't go for 2D😉."
Not perfect but something new,"Though certain moments and plot points are rushed and not thought out enough, this is still such a new and exciting film that tries to break away from the usual MCU mold and mostly succeeds."
What a mess,Convoluted and boring. Special effects and action scenes were good but this movie wasn't able to offer anything new. And seemed to have been rushed. Even the cameos were lack lustre. Shame as there was so much potential.
Mind blowing,"The movie lives up to its title. Disappointed are those who were expecting a lot of cameos or a beginning for secret wars or something else. But it was a great character arc mainly for wanda. Instead of throwing a new supervillain Marvel excellently Corrupted a superhero by her own powers and turned her into a supervillain. Be it Wanda under influence of Darkhold or the other variants of Dr. Strange.

Great work by Marvel."
It was alright I guess,"Just want to say that if you haven't yet seen the movie then keep your expectations low, because the movie I watched on the big screen didn't feel like the one in the trailers. After No Way Home, I was expecting something bigger and better than it, and NWH is a 10* deserving one for me, but this was such a letdown I feel like I've been robbed of my money. If I could I'll go back in time and not book tickets and rather wait for the OTT release... Also, I didn't think I'll ever say this as a comics fan but America Chavez is good and likable in the MCU, completely different from her in the Comics. Welp this was not the movie I signed up for."
Too much CGI,"I think, I was expecting better movie and specially from Doctor S. But this was worse and not good at all. I am going to stop watching marvel movies after this. Their story is finished and now just nonsense."
Forced and Plot all over the place,"Wanda was great. Movie was entertaining 85% of the time.

Forcing wokeness a bit too much. Pointless cameos. Not much humor on this. Could be scary for kids but good if you like dark action. Trying to do too much!! Movie will leave you feeling uncertain. I want to like it but I just feel meh...."
How Not to Make a Movie for Dummies,"I wish the pole that went through the octopus monster's eye went through mine before I decided to watch this movie. Just turned into a 2 hour tutorial on how to not make a movie. It was quite comedic after about 10 minutes of watching. But I take responsibility for finishing the movie. That's my fault, should have turned it off, but I made that mistake and that's on me."
"Possibly Spectacular, but not in this universe","With gorgeous visuals, some cliche horror tropes and jump scares and a lot to unpack in a short time, Dr. Strange's Multiverse of Madness could have been a spectacular film in another universe, but not in ours.

Instead what we got were a few moments of brilliance, fan serving cameos and a linear story with seemingly confused characters that seem to be good or bad just because the narrative tells you so.

Wanda completely unravels her Grieving arc from WandaVision (possibly one of the best acted shows in MCU). She has some brilliant moments, but with bland and unjustifiable motives, even Elizabeth Olsen's superb acting can't save her. Benedict Cumberbatch and Wong are great to watch as always, although the pairing with Xochitl Gomez does seem forced.

Sam Raimi signature directing style is ever present which could have been a good thing if they had just tried to pick a genre and stuck to it. Trying to make a superhero movie as a horror + sci-fi is already difficult enough as it is, but throw in the multiverse aspect and you've got a cocktail no one wants to drown in.

Its a shame, this was a missed opportunity which could have been a great movie in another universe."
Shallow one dimensional characters,
Just a fun superhero movie,
Solid movie,
Good one,I like this movie. It's bit faster. I liked the darkness of the cinematography and horror plots. But different than standard MCU movie. Overall satisfied watching it.
Not good enough,
Lived upto its title.,The best part of story is one cannot expect what the next scene holds for you..its a different world all together..like an adventure trip...great work marvel..keep us surprise like this...truly loved the concept of multiverse...looking forward for more mysteries to unfold...
Sam Raimi's back at its best 👌,Wish Sam Raimi would make more movies. Best work after spider man 2. Thriller with best visuals. Both Doctor Strange and Wanda characters are amazing. A first of its kind multiverse thriller. Wanted to watch it again as soon as I came out of the movie theatre. Probably IMAX the second time around.
"Fun, spectacular, but...","I like a darker approach in this one. When someone dies, it's not allways pretty and heroic. CGI is spectacular, as allways. Story is, well, passable. Not much more than that. Acting is a bit flat. Scarlet Witch and America are the weakest link. SW has two emotions, angry and sad, America is more Dora the Explorer than a Marvel hero. Ending is meh.

This is better than Eternals, but nowhere near The Avengers, CA, Ironman, or the first Doctor Strange."
Best MCU movie in my opinion as a Doctor Strange fan,"I loved everything about it, the top reviews here are cringey af.. ""not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness"".. what? Quit the stupid quip and actually say a reason the movie is bad in your opinion.

I thought the pacing was great, the movie was very easy to follow and I did not think about anything else the entire time, it kept me engaged and awed the entire time, it didn't feel too rushed though it could have been longer, and it definitely was never slow or boring. The plot was great in my opinion too.. miles better than the NWH plot."
Parents beware,
To fast,
"Darker MCU, but good","Definitely the darkest film of the MCU. There are two scenes that are kind of ""plot reasons?"" or ""Look! 3-D!"", but not enough to detract from the overall story. The story and plot are well thought out in general. It would help to have seen the Disney+ show ""What If ...?"" That can give an idea of how dark this movie goes, as many of the things the show touch on are here, too. The movie blurs the lines of good and evil a little, but it does not shy away from too much of the consequences of choosing poorly. Good story, though the squeamish and easily scared might not find a lot of enjoyment, and the plot does a good job not getting in its own way (which a lot of movies have done as of the past few years.)"
Nice Try,It was a okey movie for me. I like that they tried a new perspective to look for and used horror movie techniques. I think writing was generally consist good ideas but they could have connected each other better.
Visually Stunning,"I loved it, definitely Marvel's most visually stunning movie to date! The 3D was great, i hope it gets a 3D Blu Ray release. Also loved the unexpected horror theme, Sam Raimi was perfect for this!"
Not PG13 Should be R,
"About as ""good"" as Eternals",
Successful,"Although this may not have been as great as I was hoping, it still does a pretty decent job at all the things it's trying to accomplish and considering that it's trying accomplish quite a lot, I would say this is a success."
MCU HORRORVILLE,
multiverse never ending,"Well you have to keep an open mind and let the multiverse concept sink in The possibilities are endless Visuals and effects are crazy ""Marvel"" good Scarlett is the best reason to watch this and some good cameo's It's entertaining but mainly because of witch."
Wanda in the multiverse of madness,This should rename and re-release as wanda in the multiverse of madness with strange as cameo and other supporting staff. Wastage of time and money. Everyone should avoid.
A great Sam Raimi film,"Multiverse of Madness clearly has Sam Raimis fingerprints all over it. He flawlessly infuses it with the same trippy, scary and wacky spirit which has been featured in some of his best films."
Raimi brought this one down with the B-Movie material/shots,"Now, don't get me wrong. I enjoy Raimi and his work in a lot of movies. However, in this case, using the Evil Dead shots and acting direction is not what should have been in this movie.

I'll be honest, there is a decent amount that was good here, but he dropped the ball significantly on this one. Those who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about. You see them immediately and you're left with a bad taste at how it detracts from the movie. What was supposed to be ""horror"", you got Evil Dead 2 type of horror and camera shots/acting. And at points the goofy ""Dum"" sounds in the sound design that punctuates the scene. It was cheesy for this level of budget a film.

I'm sorry, but this just disappointed from what could have been outstanding. There was some points, especially the climax, that just came off corny and borderline disrespectful to the MCU franchise.

It's a shame as we know the cast can act. They've done great performances before, especially in the MCU, but this did not use their experience or talent to their fullest."
Braindead,"Braindead is how I would describe the writers of this movie. The pacing is a crime to humanity, the writing is a hate crime, and the dialogue is a genocide. The amount of plot holes is atrocious, and the ending was the biggest corny-cop out I've ever seen. Strange is not the main character in his own movie, and America was a bad actress and needs more expirience."
"How did this rate a ""7.1""... waste of time and money.",Tried to do too much with too little quality. Really a shame. Bought this with the thought it would at least be as good as the first. How embarrassing for all who worked on this movie! Oh well... money is money. Honor and quality are better.
Multiverse of Madness,
Greater Than Your Led To Believe!,"After hearing all the negative views, I decided to wait to watch it when it was available at home. I read no more reviews and did not read anything about the movie. After seeing Ash's Cameo, I said to myself, ""I thought he only cameos Sam Ramei movies. This movie was incredible! When Sam's name came up as The Director, all I could say was, ""Of Course It Was!""."
awful,
Jeeze,
Just meh,"It feels more like watching an episode in a TV show than a movie.

It's fine, but doesn't do anything original or exciting. I wanted to see more interesting multiverses explored or fun concepts or anything new."
Bad movie,"Doesn't show good values, good overcoming evil, but evil against evil. Where to win you have to do whatever it takes no matter what. I would not recommend this movie not to anyone, especially young people."
Brilliant Movie directing and writing,
Impressive,"This is a good superhero film. Amazing visual effects, good story, great cast and an outsdanding overall result. Sam Raimi elegantly brings touches of darkness and horror while not disrupting MCU's style. Thanks to this, he is able to create one of the gratest villains in MCU history IMO."
Unique,
Meh,It wasn't terrible. Just want that great either. Not enough multiverse. The story felt disconnected at times. I love Sam rami's style just maybe not for this film or even this MCU. Honestly kinda disappointing. Don't waste extra money to see this one in IMAX.
So much Raimi.,"A director who made superhero movies 20 years ago, and is also known for C-class horror films. All this with a MCU-lvl budget, but some habits can not be skipped and what worked well in the pre-MCU era, today is a bit dated.

Also the formula of the PG-13 ""horror"" based on the jump-scares falling out of the sleeve scene after scene and genuinely slimy scenes tweaked in CGI evokes embarrassment rather than fear and emotions."
Like a computergame,
One of the weakest Marvel movies,
"Multiverse of sadness, more like",
Bad.,
Storyline is terrible,"Storyline is weak and terrible, but the rest of the movie was amazing. I can tell Marvel is trying something new and I do appreciate their creativity. At this stage, Marvel should be focusing on strengthening their storyline which is their biggest weakness. It just makes no sense!!! Super duper cliché!"
Horrible!,This movie is not the classy doctor strange movie. Is a comedy referring to kids. Bad humour. Bad CGI. No scenario. And also bad acting! It is literally a waste of time and money. Save it and watch at home drinking some wine with your kids. If you are over 18 you are really going to be bored to death.
GLAD I DID NOT SEE THIS IN THEATRES!!,"Lost all its marvel characteristic, terrible acting from. Xochitl Gomez with facial expressions my grandma could have done better. It's a shame they threw in the zombie saus, did bring the movie an extra dimentions. Also where was the little aftermovie?

I hope Marvel does not go downhill from here, lets see what the future brings but concerning this movie i could not be more dissapointed.

Too bad for the thrown in childish creatures at the start of the movie, however this all falls in to nothing considering the poor plot and chaotic story line."
Don't believe the bad reviews here,"First up it's definitely a doctor strange moving people should stop crying they didn't get the marathon movie with more characters in the marvel world ,the movie is what it should be and great fun from start to finish."
"Overhyped but still a ""fine"" and enjoyable MCU film","Maybe just as good as the first solo Doctor Strange film but maybe not. The cinematography is excellent and the special effects/CGI were great! Sam Raimi knows the deal with action sequences as well since the films combat is in camera. It's amazing! Film has a quick set up and jumps to a solid story. The acting is great and I just can't invision anyone else playing Doctor Strange but Benedict Cumberbatch! He's sensational and I hope to see more from him in future projects. Raimi brings his action sequences to life as they are intense and very violent. There's tons of suspenseful and thrilling moments that had me on the edge of my seat and on my last breath. As for flaws, the pacing is very on and off. It does feel long for a film barely over 2 hours long when you count the credits. It took me out of the experience whenever the pacing would start falling off. Another issue I have are the cameos. No spoilers but the cameos weren't worth it for the decisions the movie makes with those cameos. There's also some character issues like for ""Mordo"". You'll see for myself what I mean here once you all see for the movie for yourself. Final boss fight was very disappointing and might be Top 5 worst in the MCU. Film may also feel incomplete once you reach the ending. I still had a good time with the film and enjoyed what this film had to offer although it could've been much better!

Letter Grade:

B-"
Don't Trust TROLLS Reviewers,"This might not be the best film but, this is one of the best MCU films. People are just down voting this movie because of how good the previous movies (infinity war, end game, no way home...) but, this is still a great movie and very entertaining."
Should've been called Wandavision 2,
Is this a movie or a self help book ?,"Okay guys cool visual effects and all,but this is not a self help book right ? Somethings in life just don't happen even if someone whispers JUST DO IT in your ear. There is literally no logic or philosophy behind this movie,just a few cool phrases and boom they are inspired and save the universe or whatever."
This is not a movie,"This is not a movie, but a video game with bad controll.

CGI and a very bad story, with very poor acting.

A waste of time, and a waste of money.

Hope the Will in the future, make a good story and less CGI."
I changed my review,
A personal opinion that comes from a friend,
"Pretty Good, but felt like ticking boxes","It starts off as a roller coaster and just keeps going. Which is fine, and covers everything it intends, but at the end leaves you with a feeling of ""OK, saw that."" This could've been arguably better handled in one of the Marvel TV series. Interesting possible future spoilers. (You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.)

People left the theater early again! Two groups at different times! These weren't young couples lookin to get busy or anything else either. It's a trip.

In IMDB-land, a 6.x means watchable but nothing that really sticks, which fits this perfectly. Maybe a 6.3-.4 or so."
spoiler alert,
Promising but not as expected,
Keeps you on the edge of your seat,"Another masterpiece by K. Feige, this movie is unlike any other released in the mcu, it was more like a horror movie, and it was done beautifully by Sam Raimi."
Hard to summarize in one sentence...,
Enjoyable movie but the multiverse was a letdown,"Purely looked as a movie which gives you a thrill ride this checks all the boxes, so I did enjoy the movie, thats why the 7, but if you were expecting more from the multiverse you will likely be disappointed. Performances by all the actors who played the main characters were really good, but plot wise, it leaves a lot wanting. The main villian is overpowered and the solution to the actual problem leaves you wondering, whether it was that simple, For such a complicated plot-line, the ending/solution should also have been matching. Other than that, obviously a lot of common sense rules were broken, like people having no urgency to act even while being chased, the villain taking forever to do something which could have been done immediately just to give the hero enough time to achieve victory etc.. But.. its a movie, so i guess its somewhat okay.."
Let's be honest here.,"This movie was all over the place.

What I hate more than anything in a movie, is a bad script.

None of the characters appear to have learned anything from their previous experiences and that is quite frustrating to watch. It feels like the writers are wasting your time with this story, especially after investing so much time into Wandavision.

There is a scene where the multiverse goes into full swing, with different characters and different takes on existing characters showing up, but again that felt pointless and a waste of the audiences time.

The CGI and effects were incredible, but in this day and age that is almost a given.

Dominic Cumberbatch was great, but again that is almost a given in his movies.

All in all its an ok movie if you want to see Doctor Strange in action, but it's probably worth waiting until its on Disney Plus rather than going out to see it in the cinema.

What was missing in this movie was a story that made sense and that drew the audience in to actual care about the outcome. By the end I didn't care because it's clear the writers didn't care about providing a story worth telling.

And don't get me started on all the not so subtle ""America"" quotes."
Not even good. What's the hype?,
Too many monsters,"I really liked the first Dr Strange but this one maybe i was expecting a lot and was disappointed. The villain was a big surprise and revealed right at the beginning. The movie had some 'fantastic' cameos that will also take you by surprise. Before watching this movie i would highly suggest watching the 'What If' cartoon series on Disney, it ties in to this film a lot.

Not one of my favourites, it was entertaining and i did enjoy it, i like the madness of the multiverse but it had a lot of monsters in it which i feel is detracted from the overall storyline."
Disney Is slowly learning,"Disney being Disney usually tends to go for a softer not as violent touch on Marvel movies, especially certain movies where It needs that practical dialogue & fight scenes, just like In the comics, In my opinion It's making them difficult for adults to watch, they tend to lack any ground to them or being practical, even If it's Marvel. This movie had It's ""softer"" moments & some bad dialogue but Sam Raimi nailed the fight scenes & the horror scenes were great & the score was good enough to make It feel even more Intense which was a plus. Im sure Disney held back on some of Sam Raimi's Idea's & scene but honestly the first film In the mcu that was directed how It should've been. If Disney keeps picking good directors I hope we see more sequences that were portrayed In the movie."
Not for everyone but I liked it,
Scarlet witch or Wanda maximoff,
Sam raimi's Masterpiece,It's just awesome movie..just simple multiverse concept...stunning visuals....great acting from Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth olsen....great touch of sam raimi in this movie....more horror elements...just chill and enjoy this movie.
A superhero movie that doesn't insult your intelligence,"Great Marvel movie. Interesting characters (except, seriously, calling her ""America"" and wearing a Progress Pride flag?). The usage of magic was as smooth as butter; it felt proper for the situation in the world rather than eye candy for the audience.

One minor plot hole: based on what they show in the movie, America should know where her parents are."
Fun but a but of a mess,"Well, it entertained but it was a bit of a chaotic mess. I know we've had these characters on our screens for years, but some character building wouldn't have gone amiss seeing as we're seeing a brand new side to some of them.

I guess if the aim was to convey ""madness"" through 2 hours of chaos, then it hits the nail on the head. Didn't seem to have a beginning, a middle and an end... just a middle and an end."
Unexpected chars with the very strange movie theme,"About the chars, we already knew if Marvel Studio really worked hard to develop audience satisfaction and loyalty. Unexpected chars?! It's a must for Marvel movies! However, this movie is very strange for the superhero theme caused by the ""apocalyptic zombie"" ambiance. The strangeness of Dr. Strange's movie. This ambiance felt very strange for superhero movies which are they're recently focused on children's segment and happiness themes. This movie is living proof if they want to bring a ""dark"" movie theme again - since Blade, Daredevil, Elektra, and The Punisher. They hope the strange theme is plausible for Doctor Strange. Maybe, they thought it was the time to join the competitive segment of the dark theme superhero, like the success of DC Comic through The Batman (2022).

The main plot is Dr. Strange forced to save a kiddo girl from being chased by a catastrophic enemy to kill her and absorb her power. This leads to adventurous trips to multiverses of the world. The pros of this movie are very incredible visuals, great moral value, and entertainment. Those three are a must for Marvel superhero movies. If need more satisfaction, this movie provides a new storyline and unexpected chars that maybe could be synchronized with another movie. Somehow, this is really providing satisfaction because we're really curious and can't wait about what is to come. Besides all of the pros, everything is just of standard quality.

However, the biggest cons are very strange movie themes. ""Apocalyptic zombie"" is really vividly narrated through the end of the story. It's really gross for me. Sadly, there is another disappointment which is the weak movie plot. Tbh, I didn't really convince enough about why trade many lives to save one life? Another odd plot is there's a bunch of chars that narrated as the great leaders but they just came in a glimpse and vanished. What is the actual point to show them in screen time? Lastly, Marvel Studios already pointed out their American political issue which brings very popular themes - American pride, LGBTQ, and Illuminati. This theme is very vividly but subtle through a char name, costume, and direct story.

Overall, in my personal POV, I really get annoyed with the ""Apocalyptic zombie"" theme but I'm satisfied with the unexpected chars. I thought it was so-so quality, but this movie is still good to watch. If u are really Marvel fans, it's a must to see this movie to guess what is the actual grand storyline in the future. If u aren't, this movie is still good to see because we could really enjoy it as newcomers that didn't know anything about Marvel."
Where's the Eye of Agamotto when you need it?,
Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness,"Ok, this seem's more like a trailer, to a possible sequel, that would be much better, to connect the dot's, with so many gap's, as they create a decent possibility of a better written and detailed explanation to the first, that seem's like a mash up of Doctor Strange & Wandavision, like a crossover between the 2. Now, for those of you, who are Marvel fan's, it's not completely terrible. Even though, they do leave some seriously huge gap's, in different part's of the movie, like I mentioned before. So, odd's are, with the 2 post-credit's scene's, to possibly understand the sequel, you may have to watch this 1, to fully understand what all is going on? Which, this might be their plan, is to leave the gap's in the movie, to be able to have the sequel, that explain's everything, as there is a more solid plot to it? Who know's for sure. But, it definitely has it's up's and down's. And, I do agree, with them pretty much opening up with the villain(Not gonna name who it is, to keep the spoiler's out of it), almost right away, not bein a good idea. And, they obviously don't have any clue about a certain secret society, or they could have done a better job with it, in my opinion. And, it feelin a bit too rushed along, is not the greatest, when it come's to movie's. In a way, it seem's as though, they took a long 4hr movie and split it in to 2 part's, with this being the dull, first part. I do have to admit, the fight scene's, were pretty good, maybe not as good as the Avenger's movie's. But, they weren't horrible, or anything like that. So, I guess we will see, what will happen in the future, if there is a sequel, that could redeem this movie, as well as give a great plot in the 2nd movie, as well. So, who know's where it's gonna go from here..."
Worst movie in the multiverse,"We have just finished watching the film. Until now I thought nothing could be more excruciating than Dredd, but this film surpassed it. I rarely think I should post my opinions on the internet, but after this horrible 2 hours of suffering I realised I would have been grateful if someone had warned me in advance so I wouldn't have thought to watch it."
Scarlet witch or wanda maximoff,
Nose diving faze four,It seems all the creativity died with vision. Everything marvel has produced since has sucked. Movies in general aren't worth paying actors millions for what exactly? I miss movies that weren't completely made in front of a green screen. Stop paying for unsatisfaction.
MCU Top spin into Strange multiverse,"This is another level of movie scripting and perfect story telling.. Marvel has well and truly embraced the realm of psychological turmoil and mind-bending narratives, first by conjuring up the infinite possibilities of the multiverse in ""Spiderman: No Way Home (2021)"" and then following up with this mega flick as one of the best ever..👌in a uni Avenger story. The cinematography, CGI, music, visuals,psychadelic effects and the unusual elements of horror and surprise add to the flummoxing experience. The movie has a ton of past references from the MCU,Fantastic 4, Disney and also the comics,and one could understand and enjoy those references only if they are familiar with the past timeline and have read a handful of comics. The direction of the movie is exactly what made it very unique. Benedict was as usual stylish and precise in his performance.. surprise package is the wide spectrum for Wanda... Lisa is muti-equipped across emotions. Movies. The character of America Chavez has also been brought into limelight in this movie,although according to me the plot made the character develop very randomly and the film. ( om personal opinion, this character should have been named India... as this is going to be the next big char from Mcu. ) When I saw the first part,I was baffled. I feel that I share a great emotional connect and resemblance with the character of Stephen Strange myself. Overall does leave you with mixed emotions of confusion,excitement,astonishment,grief but trust me it would be worth of a watch. We three me, wife and my 12 yr son thoroughly njoyed the trip..😎 The movie is dark,trippy,surprising,and bewildering. It would be highly oversimplified to call it the best marvel movie but it is definitely the most unique and different one. Cheers to the entire crew of close to 1200+ people involved in some or other form..( I sat in entire credits and counted approx that...) and.of course Sam and his team... Amazed.. at the magic of the movies once again after the highlight of Endgame!!! 👍✨👏🎉🎊 Thanks Bipin G Ezhava."
Not what trailer showed.,Trailer lied about the plot wich is a thing for Marvel but i find it cheap. I loved Elizabeth Olsen in this movie but the ending was too banal and expected. Dr. Strange was ok but still him not being the one was disdapointing. It's just a Scarlett Witch movie not a Dr. Strange.
Amazing effects but I didn't enjoy the satanist symbols,"The effects are really amazing! One of the best ones!

A thing I didn't enjoy was the satanist symbols all over the movie. It's not ok to get used to something so dangerous as witchcraft."
Dr.Strange,
Truly takes you to the multiverse of madness,The film first opens too many questions and fails to answer most of them in its plot. The director has left a lot of open-ended scenarios that they can make atleast 5 different versions of new movies from this.
Doctor Strange is the multiverses background character,"Dr. Strange came close to being a background character in his own movie. This decision and the overreliance on CGI keeps this in the lower echelon of the MCU. Wanda's story arc was decent enough if not predictable. Olsen did a commendable job in her role.

Sure cameos are fun and all, but they don't replace story...and that's where this movie was lacking. Sam Raimi was on point with his directing. It's not his fault the writing was average (at best) and its focus on the main character was lacking. I'm actually glad Sam was at the helm here, as a lesser director wouldn't have been able to even make this movie as serviceable as it turned out."
"If you love Evil Dead and Army of Darkness, this movie is for you","The movie from beginning to end has Sam Raimi's Evil Dead and Army of Darkness vibes. Great movie, actors and effects were spectacular. I loved it, a must see for Marvel and horror fans."
It left my 12 year old daughter in tears.. and not ones of joy,
Too much bad.. not enough good,
I expected more,
It was okay,
Best Part Musical Fight,"Before Musical Fight scene this movie was OK. After that it was just stretch like Elastic, we were just waiting to end it. Too much scarlet of Multiverse would be better Name."
"""Scarlett Witch: Trying to find herself"" is what it should have been called.","There are better marvel films than this. Even the last Dr Strange was better than this one. Not saying its a bad movie but could have been better.

The movie mainly focuses on Scarlett Witch rather than Dr Strange. And the title sounds misleading as there were very little multiverse shown."
Just Ok. Watch in matinee or at home,"This movie was about Wanda, not Dr. Strange.

Steven Strange was poorly written, just like in No Way Home. He isn't very bright, and he uses his powers inconsistently. Benedict Cumberbatch seemed lazy in his acting.

There was too much dialogue wherein characters explained the plot.

I don't understand the point of the multiverse. What are the pros and cons of it existing?

The special effects make this movie watchable. Elizabeth Olson did a great job acting. America Chavez was likeable only at the end when she showed some personality."
I expected a lot,"I expected this movie to be something like ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"", but to be honest it's not even 30% close to that title. The plot of this movie seems to be very poor in story telling. I expected more multiverse events and some cool madness but its only have a weak plot and some hothic scene."
As if DC made a Marvel movie,
I love Wanda or scarlet witch😍,
More like Wanda in the Multiverse of Madness,
3 Movies in 1 is Not a Good Idea.,"There is so much going on that its overwhelming. The theater was laughing in all the wrong spots due to the ridiculous nature of it. Visually spectacular, but not enough to carry the rest."
"Junk, doesn't even come close to the first one",Endgame was indeed one of the best. Don't waste your time on this one. Pure garbage don't even know why I rated it a four. I guess considering the effects and acting but the script is garbage and all over the place.
Dr. Strang 2 or Wanda Vision Next Chapter?,
The Closest We'll Get To a Marvel Horror Flick,"I won't lie, I am not a Marvel fan. I typically find the movies dry, boring, and overly pretentious, which may be due more to the cultural zeitgeist than anything else. I am, however, a massive Sam Raimi fan, and that was the only reason I saw this film. And boy did Raimi deliver. He injected a delightful sense of personality into the film that Marvel typically lacks and he really pushed his PG-13 rating. There's gore, there's scares, and there's some scenes that have that classic Evil Dead campiness to them that I really, really loved.

I was a little surprised that Raimi got as much free reign as he did, but I still feel like some of the movie was a bit stiff, which to me felt more like a script problem than anything else. It feels a bit like some things were shoved in there just to have them in there, and that those bits took some of the focus away from things that are more important, such as character development or the actual plot. Once the action starts, there is no downtime whatsoever, and it feels like you are being catapulted at breakneck speeds without time to really get to know most of the characters.

In addition, our second protagonist, America Chavez, gets very little real development over the course of the movie despite the massive potential of her character. She's just another quippy, Whedonesque teenaged superhero character, which was a bummer because I really wanted to care about her. Wanda, Strange, and Wong all had good moments where they got to shine, but America never really did.

Overall, it was a really, really fun ride and is definitely worth the watch. However, there are some glaring weaknesses that really creep in in some places and bog down the movie as a whole. Nevertheless, this is probably a movie I will rewatch."
What a Marvel!!🙃,"The new character introduced into the movie ,plays a pretty important role; besides the movie makes you question some old characters and there's a lot of unexpected twists and the storyline is quite engaging and has connections with WandaVision except that I found the illuminati part a little too much. The effects are chef's kiss. Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen have done a fab job !! Also the cliff hanger at the end is jaw dropping!"
This wasn't a super hero film it was a horror movie Disney needs to rethink their choice of directors. My whole family hated it! Not a good movie at all!,Sucks. This wasn't a super hero film it was a horror movie Disney needs to rethink their choice of directors. My whole family hated it! First time we have disliked any these films.
Epic introduction into the Multiverse.,
Another female lead who just wants to be a mother,
"If you think spiderma 3 sucks , well this movie is a good competitor","I just wanna say I have really big expectations, but it was all a mess with meh Villan and a waste on multiverse and cameos, please Raimi stop doing comic pictures you really suck."
Must see,
Utterly disappointed,
Madness is more apt to describe the plot line not the multiverse.,Madness is more apt to describe the plot line not the multiverse. A big step down from Doctor Strange 1. How much more do I have to write to have this review publish this is so painful...
I'm so disappointed,"I was soooo disappointed after watching this movie. The first Dr Strange was possibly my favorite Marvel Movie and I had very high expectations. Also, the post credit scene was the worst post credit scene ever made in any multiverse. Do not stay for the post credit scene!"
Garbage,"I think I made it maybe 35 minutes into the movie then turned it off. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this garbage. The plot, if you can call it that, was poorly constructed; the CGI wasn't great and looked fake; the dialogue was not convincing and seemed more like a B rated, direct to DVD movie."
Another boring superhero movie ..,".. for the 3 year old and the ones believing in Santa Clause or that some ""one man show"" can save the world. Grow up, kiddies!

And Hollywood: Get some fresh ideas! The 3000st pre-/sequel to the 30'000st super hero / anti super hero is really, really boooooooring!

(No wonder that movie theaters around the world are in decline. That's not because Netflix et al. Got better, but because Hollywood got much, much worse ...)"
Genuinely enjoyed it,
Very Strange indeed,
The most unmarvely marvel movie they've ever made,"Whether that's a good thing depends largely on your taste in movies. There are parts in this movie that strongly evoke B-horror movies from a bygone era. Even without knowing beforehand, you'll walk out of the theater confident that you just watched a Sam Raimi movie. That's how strongly his directing style comes across in this. And this will undoubtedly put off a lot of people who are used to the Marvel formula. This is not to say that this doesn't feel like a marvel movie from time to time, just that unlike James Gunn, who brought a style to the MCU that amplified what was already underneath more than it disrupted it, Sam Raimi unapologetically leaves his mark all over this movie even if it means breaking with what makes marvel movies so enjoyable for a lot of people.

Personally, I was a little taken back when I was watching this movie. I don't remember the last time I watched a mainstream blockbuster that was as unconventional and bold as this one. Though the horror elements are sometimes done somewhat cheaply and not as effective as it could have been, I suspect, due to the constraints of having a PG-13 rating, I still find myself excited at the prospect of the MCU finally exploring its supernatural side (can't stop thinking about how Ghost Rider would fit in now).

On a side note, this movie did make me lament the lack of horror in Moon Knight for most of the show. If that show does get a second season, I hope they'll focus more on the horror aspect of that character."
Worst Dr Strange storyline ever!,"Who in the world wrote the storyline for this and the script? Did Marvel get someone from DC to ruin everything good Marvel had all these years? Seriously what kind of silly person in Marvel allows Dr Strange to become like this?

All the adults and kids in my family absolutely hate this Dr Strange. It is like watching one of those lame dark cool wannabe DC movies. Completely horrible.

We still love the main character ofcourse and we love what Dr Strange used to be before this. Dr Strange as a character has been dumbed down to a unintelligent, no foresight superhero.

If it is like this, please do not even bother having another sequal to this. We will not waste our valued time watching the next one until whoever wrote this is fired and things go back to normal.

Again - This twisted version is absolutely lame. The founder of Marvel would be horrified and disgusted to watch this if he was alive."
Got to 34 minutes,"I had to stop after half an hour. It's was so stupid and cringy that i had to turn it off.. i loved Spiderman and the Avengers, but this... this was juat a waste of time."
Mind-boggling.. A must watch 👍🏻,"Infinity war and endgame showcased Thanos as most powerful villain in MCU whose fearsome yet blockbuster entry and attack shock and mesmerized us. Just when we thought this was peak of fear a super villain can create in MCU, this movie repeats the same fearsome villain aura. The movie also proves who is the most powerful super hero in MCU. Wanda and Doctor Strange gave a power packed performance.

A must watch.."
"Too fast, bad visual effect","The beginning of the film is VERY fast, so fast that I can't perceive the story, so I had to stop it for a while (I watch it at home). Due to that speed, the film was opaque in places. I was mainly disappointed by the bad visual effects, which were sometimes in the eyes so that the film looked artificial. So I'm disappointed and there is a lot of outrage compared to the fantastic first part of the film in 2016."
Absolutely A Must,"If you have been following the MCU, especially if you watched Wanda Vision, then this will make perfect sense. It's dark, sometimes scary and serious. There are not many movies that I would like to own, but this is one."
Great Movie,
Marvels attempt at a family horror film?,"This feels like a darker repeat of the first Dr. Strange mixed with a continuation of WandaVision. The pacing is weird and the film is not well edited at all, but Olsen and Cumberbatch give incredible performances that capture you again and again despite this flaw. The visual effects are also incredible and Raimi does a wonderful job of playing with your mind, tricking your eyes to not know where they should be looking. It's a solid entry from the MCU, and although they could have really given us more details about some new and old characters, I very much enjoyed the overall story. It won't be your favorite Marvel film, but it is a great film to go watch in theaters!"
Went as I thought it would..,"I don't understand who they were trying to aim this at, it felt like it was aimed at children but at the same time it couldn't be with the gore and horror. I'm confused. If they were trying to do a more horror movie they shouldn't have done it the way they did. And just went all out and not made it childish.

The music was so abrupt at times and really annoying, and so was the comedy it felt childlike.

For some reason. It felt like it was edited by someone on tiktok no offense to tiktok editors or anything. There is a time and place for that kind of editing and it's not in movies.

Even Disney+ didn't want me watching it, like; it kept pausing all the time.

The acting was probably the only decent thing in this movie.

I also want to say if they can put the guy from the fantastic four and make him stretchy why couldn't they do that with ms.marvel?

I didn't watch this because I wanted to but because I had to...The marvel community for some reason makes you feel bad for not watching stuff. Which was a waste of 2 hours."
"a bad decision to cut the duration of the film even though I know there is a marvel cinematic universe project that is an obstacle in terms of duration, so making this film in","The ""multiverse of madness"" from the title makes us think that this film will do crazy things (in a good sense and very worth watching) but the delivery of the plot is quite clear and the presentation of the horror is good, but I can't give a high enough rating for an ""mcu movie"" because it didn't live up to expectations."
Musics,I loved the Wanda's emotinoal scenes. We saw the story of her side and heart. But musics wast the worst part of the movie. Musics was not good and powerfull enough. I wish Hans zimmer made the all musics of movie.
Amazing Experience,"One of the marvel movie, great movie.. One of the marvel movie, great movie.. One of the marvel movie, great movie.. One of the marvel movie, great movie.."
Sam Raimi's amazing direction makes up for a lacklustre screenplay,
Not really Marvel standards,"As a HUGE MARVEL fan since Iron man 1, I must unfortunately admit that this movie wasn't the best. The director was the director of multiple horror movies and unfortunately it shows in this movie too. It gave occult vibes and was very dark for a MARVEL movie. There were barely any comedic, lighthearted moments and the storyline was super dark. I'm a little disappointed. But the acting was incredible and the CGI was as always spectacular."
Finally a comic book film that felt like it came from a comic,Excellent. As the headline says an MCU film that felt like it was part of the comic universe. They actually managed to have a tenticalled monster that made sense unlilke a certain DC film. I was getting bored by super hero/comic book films/series but this managed to excite and be inovative. But where the multiverse has normally being a script cop out in so many TV series they actually managed to make it work. The last Spiderman wasnt too far off. Very clever to use the MV to seemlessly incorporate the recently integrated other franchises. Very enjoyable.
"Thank you for this, Sam Raimi!",
doctor weird universe madness,
Multimadness,"...multiverse...multiplier...multimedia...multistate...multilevel...multitrack...multiprocessing...multifunctional...multiphase...Nicolas Cage...Doctor Strange...demultiplexers...multicell...strange of multi...

All kind of variation are discovered but in the end we got this. I am glad I watched this but my peace will never rest..."
An enjoyable movie but it does have its flaws.,"I personally quite enjoyed the movie, however on the whole it felt a bit rushed and could have benefitted with slightly more grounded character story telling. The action scenes are great and visually it is captivating but It feels like the movie was in such a rush to tell the story that it brushed over its own main characters, most notably Chavez, her acting was solid but it felt like she was more there as a plot device as supposed to a genuine character. The horror elements are great and the movie has clear traces of Raimi , I particularly enjoyed the horror elements. However Strange was massively nerfed in his own second outing and Wanda massively over powered which is so inconsistent of Marvel. The cameos ( while I enjoyed them ) were purely done for cameos sake and to get a reaction out of crowds. In the end it felt like the movie was trying to combine a lot together and it felt a little messy and the Wanda plot felt a little weak and felt like Dr Strange was slightly sidelined at times in his own movie. Although the movie was solid and the acting was fantastic, it felt like a step down following up from NWH and feels a lot more forgettable than Strange 1."
A drawn-out introduction to a new character.,
Great film but definitely going to be a decisive one amongst fans,"I didn't have much hype for this film I thought it would be fine and nothing else sam rami was the only thing I was really excited about but I really enjoyed this,First I would like to applaud Sam for his direction in this film because wow it was nice to see a marvel do something different for once in terms of direction and overall how the film looks from the shots to the transitions this film knocked it out of the park. I will warn if you're going into this film thinking there's going to be hundreds of cameo's you're going to be disappointed,Scarlett witch is the best she's ever been in this film I find wandavison personally disappointing but the massively improved her here and america chaverez was one the stand outs for me very charming and likeable. The action was great really good stuff here but my god the horror elements were like a dream come true this is what this film needed,The only negatives I can think of is there being a lot of exposition it got confusing sometimes trying to juggle the information but it sorted it self out by the end. Like I said people will not like this film in terms of what their expectations are but I loved it,Top stuff from Sam rami and the team!"
Horrible writing and CGI= horrible movie,Really there is sooo much to complain about with this movie but really it just comes down to bad writing and horrible CGI. I think a 2 year old could write a better script.
UNIQUE,"No words to say. Sam raimi lived up to his name. The movie was the best marvel movie after infinity war. The movie is full of surprises. The movie has a few minor shortcomings, I don't think it's necessary to consider them too much."
What is Disney doing to Marvel?,
Garbage,"Waste of 2 hours.

So disappointed with this film after really looking forward to watching it.

Not a Marvel film I will watch more than once, just about managed once.

The special effects are worth the stars but not much else.

Some will thoroughly enjoy it and good for them."
Worst Marvel yet.,Acting was terrible. The dialogue was terrible. Disney has lost their way and they're making movies that express opinions and desires of a small percentage of the population. I'll never get that two and a half hours back.
Good but..,I wasnt bored also not amazed. I think there is a lack of emotions. There are elements for it in the story but they coudnt manage to give it to audience. I see some people comparing it with Endgame. In every sense endgame was way better.
Classic Marvel action movie,"Almost 126 minutes of computer generated images movie in complete madness.

Non-stop action packed movie that keeps you glued to your seat.

Perfectly entertaining but no big surprises."
Went with no expectations but then also came out disappointed,"The movie is not very interesting, plot was straight forward but I don't like the story at all, some scenes were too drag out and others important scenes were too short.

Since I saw the early reviews, I went went with empty mind then also I didn't like the movie. And I am not saying this because of cameos.

Also the dark scenes in the 2nd half weren't so dark as they were saying in the early reviews. I feel they were okay.

Only thing which I like is the camera work, sam ramy did the great job in this part

Overall I felt movie was not that great and its okay to skip this one."
Unconvincing But Entertaining.,
Sam Raimi and the MCU.,
I think I expected too much from this movie,
A Missed Opportunity,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness continues the story of Stephen Strange, as threats concerning the Multiverse unfold. Is this a worthy sequel of the first Strange installment, or is it just pure madness?

The Movie itself is visually great. With cool action sequences and plenty of magic spells it seems that Marvel spent time on making the movie look good. Directed by Sam Raimi the film has plenty of Horror vibes and it's plain to see that's the way Marvel intended it. The main issue of the movie comes with the plot. At times it doesn't seem like the story knows which way its heading. The story idea overall was intriguing, but I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed as I left the theater.

After game changing films like ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame"", and the most recent ""Spiderman No Way Home"" it's hard to settle for a story that isn't quite as significant. For something as huge as the Multiverse I figured Marvel Studios would have leapt at the opportunity to dive deep into the complexity and Madness of this new world. Yet the plot focused on a story that in the end doesn't lead us not very far into story building. Maybe a little more madness and creativity would have made this a better movie. It's one of those films that just could have used a bit more movie magic."
Masterpiece,What a movie. This movie really defined the term madness. Sam Raimi took this movie to another level he's walk on horror movies paid off in this movie. What made me more excited Is marvel killing off the Scarlet witch A marvel character that is unnecessary. I can't wait for the third movie. Keep up the good work marvel 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yawn!!,
I enjoyed it and liked the twists to it,
Fantastic,Best cameo in MCU with Bruce people mad about the post credit scene it was not for you haha it was an awesome brutal movie. Awesome fight scenes too especially the music note scene.
Do we need another dr strange?,"I went to see this movie as i wanted to get into the marvel universe again. I must say I didn't like the first movie. I wasn't expecting anything but something that would eventually link all previous movies...sadly like Spider-Man this is becoming ridiculously Disney movies. Lots of effects stupid horrible monsters and no story. At the end you just wonder what was actually the script. Whil they want us to dive into the parallel univers 'mul;inverse' i prefer the idea from the avengers than a book in a middle of universes with dark powers that made Wanda a bad mother ahah .

Anyways like any marvels since the death of Lee and Disney's leading the movie world. There is nothing to expect than just hoping to have a good time.

Can't wait the new Thor in which I will laugh while in Dr strange it's just deadly boring."
So dark. Not kid friendly,"Disney is turning away from being anything like kid friendly. I'm going to have to start looking at the parents guide before I can watch a marvel movie, or really any Disney movie. This is so sad to me. This is the movie where they try to see how far into this realm they can go. And they've lost me."
Snooze fest. Dumb. Didn't feel like Marvel,This movie didn't know what it was supposed to be. Almost like a horror movie trying to be a marvel movie with a little dawn of the dead.. I have loved every Marvel movie except this one. Story was dull and when an sociopathic witch is chasing you yet you don't move with any urgency= bad writing. Only thing good was the acting.
This is a movie not for all,
I'm worried about the current trajectory of the MCU,
Hats off the Sam Raimi,
Absolutely amazing!,"I base my reviews on whether I could or want to sit through the movie again, I have to say I absolutely want to see this movie again and again and again.

I thoroughly enjoyed this, it had twists and character introductions I didn't see coming and I loved it.

All acting was on point, all high tension scenes had a dash of whimsy which I really respond well to.

Amazing effects and story.

Great addition to the MCU, really looking forward to the next installment."
Yeah its good,
"That sh*t was dope, yo!","Maybe I'm a little biased being a diehard Sam Raimi fan but between the CGI, the action and the horror element (hence why I love Raimi), I absolutely loved this movie.

Nowadays I tend to despise Disney but I couldn't pass this one up, and I'm glad I didn't. Fans of horror and superheroes I think will thoroughly enjoy this, and if you're an Evil Dead fan then you'll really appreciate the Bruce Campbell cameo :)"
The kids knocked a point off,"Downsides: Wanda's kids were so annoying. They seemed like generic B grade kids from juice commercial or something.

The characters were very predictable. I found myself finishing characters lines.

The downside with characters like Scarlett Witch and Dr Strange is that there are no rules to their magic. They can do everything until they can't. So the fights have no fear or intensity, just a bunch of strange visuals.

Positives: lots of Easter eggs and multiverse characters.

I didn't actually know exactly where the story was going until close to the end."
Typical Sam Raimi's work,
jumped the shark,"I mean music notes? A lot scenes seemed over the top and unnecessary, even for a Marvel movie. It has a lot of action from the beginning to the end, so you should hold on for the ride."
Dissapointing,"I really wanted to like this movie, however inconsistent pacing and poor plot development among other issues let down Dr. Strange fans.

Pros:

Creativity: I like how Raimi tried to incorporate some horror into a marvel movie, I think marvel in general needs to be more open to creative direction.

CGI: Fight scenes were great and what I expected from a Dr Strange Movie.

Cons:

Inconsistent pacing and underdeveloped plot. Felt like the movie had no room to breathe. It went from event to event without much explanation or causality. This movie was hard to follow.

Low 3D Framerate: I opted to see this movie in 3D and the low framerate sort of took away from the experience. I think I will see future movies in 2D.

Powerscaling: Without getting into spoilers I think the powerscaling was way off this movie."
"I loved the atmosphere this movie had and the way it played on my emotions and excitements, it was again a great cinematic experience!","Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness: Non Spoiler review;

My expectations were succeeded; It had a bit of a horror tone (Evil Dead vibes) mixed with an enjoyable and interesting storyline, lovely and fresh characters and as always great fight scene's.

The CGI was great throughout the movie but these days I am not sure anymore with marvel flicks what the difference is in CGI backgrounds or real landscapes. So that's a good thing right?

I feel like Phase 4 hasn't really let me down yet in its use of soundtracks.

I just feel like they really screwed up with all the trailers and teasers, I'm glad I ignored most of them and kind of only seen the one at the end of No Way Home but after rewachting them all I felt like they've shown way to much... Like No Way Home, I loved the atmosphere this movie had and the way it played on my emotions and excitements, it was again a great cinematic experience!

This movie proves that a Marvel flick doesn't always need to last longer than 2 hours to have a good storyline and a lot of action.

And the best thing was that it didn't even felt rushed at all, when the end credits rolled my second reaction after 'what just happened?' was; are you sure this one wasn't longer than 2hours...?

Also: 2 after credit scenes!"
Micheal Bay kind of plot,
Great Movie to Watch for Only The First Time,"Watched this during long holiday with mum. Great movie I can say to watch with your family, but I won't watch it twice. I didn't hate Wanda, but the story really lack of character development. I can't empathy with the conflicts and the ending isn't satisfying. I feel this isn't worth the money if you expect to watch movie that will stay with you even after you get home. I probably forget what this movie about if my friend ask a review about it next day....

and I'm not sure if I watch Dr Strange movie or Wanda movie......"
Groovy!,I only have one word for this movie- Groovy! This is Sam Raimi's MCU-style movie. I was a bit worried that he'll tone down a bit but he didn't. Everything is done jn Sam Raimi's style. Also I think it has the best visuals in an MCU movie. It was 100% worth it seeing it in a Imax 3d. Trust me dont miss this in Imax. Only problem I had with this was this movie had sloppy writing. Actual plot of this movie is not that epic as I thought it'll be. I had great expectations on writing part cause this movie had Loki's writer.
It's the hope that kills you..,"A fantastic start & plot which sadly lacked any real bite in the end.

I really enjoyed the darker tones to this movie, the Rami effect was a welcome one to marvel movies that can sometimes lack a punch.

The initial plot was so promising and the first 1/3 of the movie was a 10/10, however it got a little messy as time went on, and I felt like I always knew what was going to happen in the end.

Maybe the movie was built up so much that it was always going to be tough to live up to its billing, but I just left feeling slightly underwhelmed.."
Madness indeed...,
Doctor Stranger will be return!!,"A good movie deserves to be seen at home, not at the cinema, you spend money at the cinema for nothing. ""Doctor Strange will be return"", this sentence makes you think??"
"DS 1 was a beautiful piece, DS2 is a rerun of Black Panther/Infinity War","So tired of comic book movies that seem to demand battle scene boredom rather than good story. It's a shame to ruin this franchise with mindless bombings and useless horror.

Was hoping for so much better."
Disappointing,"I wanted to like this movie so bad, but I just couldn't. Halfway through I was ready for it to end. The plot was bland and honestly kind of pointless. The multiverse hopping could have been so much cooler, but I feel like it was just poorly executed. Also not a big fan of the demonic elements...has Marvel always been like this? Overall, disappointing and would not see again."
No way home better??? No way,
"A Refreshing, Wild Ride","Movies of the MCU have been accused of being formulatic over the past few years, but this movie certainly doesn't follow the formula of previous pictures of this huge universe, which we can now feel free to call multiverse. The movie starts fast, and doesn't stop, until the credits start rolling, featuring some surprising cameos, a small amount of light jumpscares, and some brutal scenes, like you've never seen before in the MCU. Multiverse of Madness tries something brand new and fortunately, it works well. It's a thrilling ride with lovable characters and an enjoyable storyline, showing a new side of this multiverse that I'm certain everyone will be happy to see."
This MCU movie is a BRUH MOMENT.,"I stopped being an MCU fan after the ending of Avengers endgame and after watching this movie I still am a retired MCU fan.

The whole story feels chaotic with all the stuff thats going on idk you never really know whats going to happen next with all the control of reality and multiverse crap going around. The story progresses with new stuff being introduced every 2 mins and it feel like they keep on adding new 'never heard of stuff' to just progress the plot. But dont get me wrong this WandaVision 2 movie is really good in terms of VFX."
Woooow!!,"Well, to begin it goes without saying ki its a Marvel movie, its gonna rock.. and it does.. the pace is set right from scene 1.. great story, lovely performances from the entire cast especially Elizabeth Olsen, the emotions of a mother and on the hand of the Scarlet Witch... woow.. she absolutely nailed the role.. award winning performance.. the CGI, direction everything rocked... Benedict Cumerbatch, well he is born to be Dr. Strange! Superb.. Sam Raimi hats off!!

Just one thing, the movie should have been longer, coz some parts felt rushed.. we would have loved a bit more of the Illuminati.. Awaiting Doctor Strange 3!!"
"Not a Dr. Strange 2, but still a great movie","The biggest problem of this movie is the title. Its not Doctor Strange 2. It is (as other people pointed out) instead the final missing episode of Wandavison, a show on Disney+ following Wanda after the events of Endgame. And I think the only reason people are rating this movie so badly is because their expectations weren't met, because it is wildly entertaining and not at all a bad movie. Yes the writing could be better and the character arcs are flat, but this is a marvel movie come on. That is all excused with the cinematics. This movie is made for big screens and that is what all movies should be made for. The visuals of the multiverse, sorcery and witchcraft, combined with the detailed soundscape of the horror inspired scenes and the great orchestrated music performances makes one hell of a great movie. Less cringe Disney humor and a lot of scenes that are at the edge of an R rating finally move the MCU away from being a kids show made for adults.

This is not a Doctor Strange 2 and yes I am also disappointed by that and I still hope we wil see a Doctor Strange 2 (though unlikely now), but i also wouldn't want to miss what they made instead and I hope they keep following this direction and put even more madness in the multiverse.

Pros:


Cons:"
End of an era,
When the Production Studio fails the filmmakers,There was absolutely no story to tell here. There is no threat other than what our heros create for themselves. We are not concerned about the built up to the next Avenger movie. We just want a good Marvel movie. Make no mistake Sam Raimi did a fantastic job of bringing his panache in this film but alas the story is extremely pointless. Even Benedict has done a excellent job and if you shut your brain you might enjoy the spectacular action that goes on. But at the end I am left disappointed.
mediocre at best,"It was fine. That's it. It was fine. Not upset. Not thrilled. Just fine. It was whelming. Not overwhelming. Not underwhelming. Just. Whelming.

So, there you go. Prepare to be whelmed."
The worst Marvel movie ever. Unfortunately,"The characters of Dr Strange and Wanda differs too much from previous movies that you sometimes can't recognize them. If the director planned to make the Marvel fans dissapoint with these incredible heroes, he did his work perfectly.

The movie is a total chaos with the elements of cheap horror for teenagers. The Multiverse should not include as much ""new"" characters as moviemakers can create at all. Too much of cheap visual effects, absence of a plot, absence of an idea that Marvel movies had for the whole time.

I think the theme of Multiverse is not developped in a proper way. Unfortunately, it's a not Multiverse of Madness, but just madness of chaosverse. I would rather rewatch the incredible newest Spider Man with the perfect developping of the theme of the multiverse."
Dr. Strange and the Multiverse could be one of the best storylines,"But it isn't. The beginning of the movie was promising but after 30 min the storyline flattened heavily and lost its self in very good CGI Effects and marvel typical fights. Sure it's a comic adaption so we shouldn't expect too much but Dr. Strange as a character and the theory of the multiverse has in my opinion an immense potential of mindblowing Storytelling. Instant it's another Disney and marvel heavy glorification of good and bad that turns good at the end with the new Hollywood typical view of current gender and stereotypes and so on, so it fells like the same story just warmed up and served with other costumes. All overall the snacks in the cinema were great as like as the stunning effects and the action scenes but if you expecting great story's like the older marvel movies, you may get disappointed."
it wasn't as good as first one but still good,"This wasn't as good as the other ones but it was still enjoyable. Im not sure what to say other than that. I think it's likely tiring all these marvel film. But I like all types of movies and even these big shallow ones are fun from time to time. Next, I will watch some art house to reset the palette, or maybe a mob movie."
My favourite Marvel film so far,"I loved this and baffled by the negative reviews. Wanda/ Scarlet Witch is a scene stealer and takes you on an emotional and slightly terrifying journey. Really enjoyed the horror elements of this, much darker and brutal than other Marvel movies. Admittedly my husband was the instigator of us seeing this at the cinema but I loved it. Strange is his usual awesome self, the story & plot was deep enough without over complicating/ trying to confuse the audience. Don't let the negative reviews put you off, make up your own mind with this one.."
Multiverse of Headaches.,"God it was bad. Not only because the film had no sense or story line at all, but because they ruined the success of the first one!

Apart from the characters we already knew (which they developed naturally in other films) all the new ones just came out of the blue without being introduced. Jumping through the ""multiverse"" and improvising solutions on the fly to fix the last mess they made, just how the film was made.

Needless to say, they had me embarrassed with that zombie DS, what a way to waste a talent like Benedict."
Multiverse of boredom...,
Dr Odd in the Uterus of Madness,"Close your eyes & listen to the dialogue & the 4 stars makes sense; in fact it will strike as generous.

It's gobbledygook. Apparently if you've seen the Disney Wanda spin-off (which I haven't), it makes more sense; but I doubt it.

I think this film's target audience is female sci-fi fans?

Wanda is bad now? However she's not scary (too pretty to be scary) & Dr Strange is a bit-part player in her story; I guess. Gets better towards the end.

Has the obligatory pseudo righteous (hypocritical) Disney wibble-wobble & a union jack clad (to the majority of Ireland, half of Scotland and various other peoples around the world, villain) superhero & zombies."
Best Marvel movie I've seen to date,
A Trip! Sam Raimi Was Perfect for This,"This is another MCU film that blended genres. In this case with horror. And it works. The character journeys were well respected despite the blend, which must have been tricky writing wise. There were campy moments but at this point if you don't want camp, why are you watching a movie with a sorcerer and a witch? A fun movie, worth the watch in theaters especially."
Multiverse and Madness...,
Carried by Stunning Visuals and a Brilliant Olsen,
Fabulous And Mind Bending Experience,It's The First Marvel Movie Which Pushed Its Limits From PG 13 . The Story Was So Well Written. It's Direction And Camera Works Were So Beautiful. Elizabeth Olsen's Acting Was So So Good . She Was The Key Element For This Movie. It Also Had A Bit Of Horror Elements And Jumpscares Which Was Amazing. The VFX In This Movie Was Unbeatable. It's Far By The Best Marvel Movie Ever. The Only Thing That Disappointed Many People Including Me Was It's Run Time But It Didn't Affect The Story And It's Enjoyment . I Hope I Go To The Premiere Of Any Marvel Movie With Elizabeth Olsen In It.
First one was far better.,Whole movie was targeted only for one mission ? Must watch to first one to forget this one. Was too much madness of multiuniverse. Story could be much better.
Great movie? No. Great direction? YES!!,
Elizabeth Olsen Just is Not that Cinematc,Nothing against her - she just not seem to elicit star power in her movies. The movie was a chore
Made for General Audience...,This movie is good but not a best MCU film like spiderman no way home. This movie is made for General Audience and more cliche scenes. Strange presence is not very impactful and no origin story for America Chavez. And not expected level of exploration of multiverse and descent level of cameos. Wanda character writing in this movie is good. Visual effects are good. End of wandavision Wanda becomes good but in the beginning of doctor strange multiverse of madness Wanda becomes ruthless doesn't give any justification for Character arc for Wanda .Relationship between Dr strange and chavez is well portrayed.
Great,It was one of the best movie of MARVEL. I love the Charakter Scarlett witch and doctor strange is awesome It was totally a different movie that MARVEL ever made.
"Honestly, I was only rooting for Wanda throughout this film",
Doesn't meet the expectations,"Pro's :- Wanda - OMG what an performance Horror Scenes

Cons:- The appearance of the Illuminati is just to boost the screen presence but a total waste Home coming > MoM Useless post credit scenes."
Sam Raimi finally gets his superhero movie,"Amazing style choices, my favorite Marvel movie in awhile. If you are a fan of Sam Raimi, you'll love Dr. Strange. He finally gets redemption from the honestly mediocre original Spider-Man trilogy."
Garbage movie with plot that is over used and recycled,"It's almost seems like this franchise is at odds with itself. It's formula has guaranteed it's success, but that same formula is now stagnating every entry into varying levels of mediocrity. They had their big finale with Endgame so it's frustrating that they seem so resistant to change. They've finally got the chance to bring on filmmakers with a specific vision to do whatever the hell they want but they're still funnelled into the same studio system so they can make safe crowdpleasers that set up the next big story event.

I honestly haven't left an MCU film feeling satisfied in years, because they're always dangling another carrot on a stick. It always feels like what I'm seeing is less important than what they're promising next, but all these films are so homogeneous that they're never actually that exciting.

For the 90% of the movie run time, it feels like they're just time fillers, not movies that will be remembered."
Just terrible,Imagine going in to the theater expecting a Marvel movie and getting a DC movie instead. It started out fresh and then the febreze ran out and it stank.
Disney can't keep up with True Marvel Essence.,"This movie was a flop, wether it was the terrible lack of attention to details, or the slow and comical tv show style acting. They messed up on every corner they could. This was just to take up time and make some money for Disney. Wish they would stop going for the money and start doing better work on there films. This gives me Arnold(Aka Mr Freeze) vibes!"
Disgusting,The WORST movie ever! It's FULL of nothing but evil! Disney and Marvel are no longer for children. Disgusted so much I left! Wish I could get a negative star. This trash is NOT for children or adults!
meh,This movie was all over the place lowkey. The plot was just kind of all over the place and i was actually giggling at how bad some of the fight scenes were. I love doctor strange and i j felt like his personality wasn't written well. But yay for more wanda ig.
"Simply speaking, not good.","It was incredibly bad in a LOT of ways. The premise of the movie was great, the reason I was looking forward to it so much. So extremely corny, campy, devoid of substance. Sam Raimi really ""messed"" the bed with it. I guess that's what you get when you try to turn a Marvel movie into Evil Dead."
"An unpredictable, great story",
Stands out in a bad way,"The movie which has been marketed as the first grand MCU adventure into the mulitverse, features the ""madness of the multiverse"" for only about a minute or two. This in itself is disappointing, but the movie does more by undoing the character development of Wanda from the show by portraying her as a ""mother monster"". The cameos are pointless, the plot is hollow, and the ending is disappointing. America and Wang are easily the stars of the show, but the movie fails to give them good character development. It is also one of the shortest movies in the MCU, and quite easily one of the worst."
Rated below battlefield earth!,"Save your your movie night! Don't watch this 2 hr torture test! The beginning started off great, a little wobbly but nothing that couldn't be saved. Half way through it was too much for my wife and I to bare and we were force to take a break. After a few more breaks we eventually got to the end. We were greeted with the cringiest, corniest, cheesiest ending I have ever had bare witness to. The very, very, last line. Was ""it's over"" that was the best part of the movie."
Scarlet Witch in the Multiverse of Madness,"It was like a video game or a movie suitable for young children. Not horror, not thriller, not Marvel.

I expected 6 whole years for this movie and this is what I got.... I wish I had never seen this movie.

Dr Strange had a role. He was not the main character. The whole movie is about two women.

I think that the main problem is the script. Not a good script means not a good movie.

The only good part is Benedict Cumberbatch's acting skills, otherwise the movie does not deserve a single star."
"""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" aka Doctor Strange 2. Doctor Strange's adventure continues to his direct sequel film!",
Marvel Phase-4 getting bad through each release,"Ohhh may be i went with so much hopes and most of us all did but marvel have to blame it. Each movie is worst than before in phase-4 except spider man.

The movie is watchable but its just fancy vfx that is it. Story line and plot is weak. America Chavez should learn better acting. Can't be like this in a super budgeted and established Marvel movie and ofcourse they made complete fun of the illuminati which was unnecessary. I hope they learn from out of this and Thor: love & thunder would have a better storyline."
Not enough multiverse and chooses mediocrity over madness,
Sam Raimi has always been ahead of his time,"Giving us the first Marvel horror movie He gave us plot He gave us amazing cgi He gave us two of the best performances in the MCU ( Benedict's and Elizabeth's ) He gave us everything we needed and more I cannot wait to see what the future holds for Marvel, phase 4 is top tier so far."
"10 Stars for Cumberbatch, 1 Star for the Rest","The title says it all. I'm watching this movie just to see Benedict Cumberbatch. I'm 100% straight but as a tailor in real life, this guy's stylishness just speaks to me on a very deep level.

As for the rest of the movie? Nah, and they're trying too hard to enforce pointless diversity too. You've got a girl called America (seriously?), a fat Asian, an unattractive woman, and an ugly black woman (sigh). The rest are of course just explosions and cliches."
Not a Doctor Strange Movie,
Too chaotic and Waste of characters,
Amazing nerdgasm,"I love the multiverse setup from both DC and Marvel, both from comics and animated movies and series. It was really fun to watch both ""what if"" and ""Loki"" series on Disney plus and ""Multiverse of madness"" is a movie building very well on all of that.

If you don't like the multiverse setup you probably wont like where Marvel is heading in the first place, and if you enjoy the multiverse setup you will love this movie. It feels like the way to go to be able to build onwards after 4 whole phases are completed.

I almost fell out of my chair with the demon wings! Nerdgasm!!! You will know when you see it!"
What was this?,"The film had a contagious beginning, but its development went downhill. Simplistic, forced and lazy solutions. Completely incoherent outcome of what was shown in the course of the end. Worst Marvel movie."
It's Good But..... Could Have Been Better!!,"The movie started great. The Visual effects were mind-blowing, the acting and the background score was really good. Sorry, I don't wanna give the spoilers but the cameos were really good too. I just needed more of Illuminati. But the real problem in this movie was it's runtime. I don't understand why they changed the runtime in the final cut. It wasn't a good decision at all. They could show us alot more things. The movie felt very fast paced. It wasn't needed though.

Let me end by saying that I am a big fan of MCU. That's why I'm a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, its entertaining and has some good scenes that I really enjoyed.

My overall rating for this movie is - 7/10."
This made me wish they never stopped Thanos,"Years of rooting for Wanda just thrown away. Why was so much of the movie surrounding Strange and Christine but there was not a single mention of Vision in the other multiverses? It's like Sam Raimi was told to just forget everything that Disney has set up for us between Loki and Wandavision. I was beyond excited to see two of my favorite Avengers team up to explore the universe and maybe stumble upon Kang the Conqueror but no. There was no plot, no arc, and I'm so disappointed."
I was super hyped but then disappointed.,"I been a marvel fan for a while now.

This movie was so hyped up. It could have had so much more potential, maybe and even part 1 and 2.

There could have been so much more coverage and detail, but it felt rushed.

The build up was so huge, and then it ended so quick.

I wish they could have done a better job."
The content of multiverse is wonderful.,Amazing concept of the movie. I enjoyed too much . It's fabbbbbb . Doctor strange is real a super hero . This movie should be blockbuster. Loved it so much. Wonda is also a great avenger and superhero.
Such a disappointment.,
Really good movie,
Reasonable special effects with some weak characters,"While the movie was fun, it is a debatable choice to include America Chavez, who is one of the least popular characters in the entire Marvel Universe, as a focal point. Almost any other plot device would have worked for this conflict. It could be an attempt to boost the weak comic book sales for that title.

The action scenes are worthwhile as are the special effects. It is surprising to see an alternative Sorcerer Supreme who keeps on playing second fiddle to Dr. Strange.

There is some humour mixed in with the action which is always welcome."
The worst film I've ever seen.,"Period. An atrocious, tortured, overlong mess of a film. So unintelligent that it becomes insulting. A joke. I left the cinema wanting to enter a multiverse where this film never existed.

I gave it 1 star for Elizabeth Olsen. She was excellent and I'm sorry she had to turn up to work for this."
Barely above average,"The plot is a jumbled attempt to give reason for the multiverse to be included. There was plenty of lore to pull from to make much more sense. The visuals were good, sound was good, plot was poor, and to my surprise the movie was significantly more violent than expected. The cameos in the film were great and a good way to introduce new teams and stories but was disappointing at the same time as they didn't do almost anything.

All and all an average marvel movie thats writing is noticeably lacking."
Multiverse Madness began.,"What i felt that, this is just a beginning of the phase four and everything gonna revolve around the multiverse. And in this movie it was just a glimpse of it. People saying that this was not that good or didn't reach there expectations. But i would say, watch it as a new thing or as a fresh slate of everything."
"Well, is it enjoyable? Yesss and yess","I think this movie has a lot of plot holes , but the acting has been phenomenal that's what keeps us in a movie. I think this movie shouldn't have used the word multiverse of madness in title which has led to too much expectations and speculation. I think this movie was at it's purest form and many things in the future will be based on this movie."
So disappointing...,
Rumours are rumours,This movie was average movie seem like watching wanda vision season 2 or just say episode 10 don't keep any expectations and remember rumours are rumours.
Movie was superb not up to that mark because of leaks and grand level hype but honestly superb by story and if you haven't got be leaks it will be a blockbuster for you,"This is not old marvel they all showed some mature content not too much but many new things you will be memorising spiderman 1,2 and 3 because of sam raymi a perfect direction best acting especially Elizabeth olsen and our doctor 😂 nice movie."
Above-average,
Medicore storyline with tons of action.,"The movie begins of with action and continues to show action until the very end. Getting overwhelmed with the action the story is heavily below average.

It's seems like marvel is just making movies for the sake of box office collection with relying hugely on action scenes and ignoring that a good movie had balance of good story and fight scenes. ."
Can't believe i slept on this one!!!,So after Avengers: Endgame (which i personally thought was one of the worst MCU movies) and the terrible Disney+ shows i started to not care about Marvel movies. This is where my review titles comes in. I wish i had seen this sooner. I was thoroughly entertained the entire time and this ranks among my favorite MCU movies to date. I didn't plan on seeing the new Thor movie in the theater but after watching this i just bought tickets. I really hope Disney can turn it around with their Disney+ shows going forward (Ms. Marvel and She Hulk look terrible).
It's really amazing roller coasters movie,"It's really amazing roller coasters movie.

Movie sounds effects it's really nice.

Movie vfx also very good overall great experience.

Now I'm so excited for Doctor strange part 3."
Dr Strange put me off Marvel Films,After seeing the Spider Man No Way Home in 2021 I was excited about seeing Dr Strange MoM. I thought that the story with be interesting and entertaining and even bought a ticket for a friend who doesn't like this kind of films. What I mistake I made! The story was so average and basic I felt insulted I had to watch this nonsense film. There was no option but to leave the cinema. If you're 10 years old you'll enjoy it for the special effects. If you're older don't waste your money.
Very poor writing,"Great potential was wasted by a very poorly written script full of logical plot holes, worse than the Black Widow movie. CGI, sets, and a good director cannot overcome that. Was not worth watching in the theaters."
doctor strange in the multiverse of disappointment,
Typical Marvel Movie,"Nonstop CGI explosions and one-liners to the point of nausea. The perfect formula for box office success and epileptic seizures.

Marvel needs to learn a few tips from the Batman movies that actually have a little mental stimulation with dialogue."
Brilliance visualized,"Dont listen to me or the other reviews, just please go watch this film. I didn't watch any trailers or teasers going into this film so I was able to watch it with as unbiased of a mindset as possible and I honestly found value in each scene. The visualization itself deserves a watch in the big screen. It's something to behold and admire. The simplicity in which they introduced and explained the complicated concept of the multiverse and it's possible implications was highly commendable. Finally, they successfully play with a different genre and finally break out of the formulaic approach they used for dissapointments like Black Widow, Shang Chi, and the Eternals. This really is a must watch film but don't go into it thinking oh I want to see a certain cameo do this or that. No way home has ruined marvel fans in the sense that they expect cameos or nostalgia to be greater than the scene or the overarching plot of the film. The cameos fulfil their role and flow naturally in the script, they aren't given unnecessary screen time, they are treated like any other character. Please do watch this film."
Worst marvel ever,
A classic fun Marvel Movie,"The only complaint i have for this movie is the small amount of multiverse traversal, i would like more on that on the future as this movie sets the stage for lots of potential. The cameos are promising and they feel normal and not just for pure fan service."
It doesn't try to be special and that's why it is,"Doctor strange 2 is a reminder of the good old marvel movies, before the disney era. It doesn't change a lot about the mcu, it creates good character development and respects the marvel comics. Raimi delivered us a wonder as usual. Ok, if you are a fan and have paid to watch this you are probably not liking it at all because you expected great things happening and a set up for the next movie. That's the same reason why I loved the eternals. It is a standalone film that does not care about what the fans want. An advice to Kevin Feige: never listen to the fans again."
No one got what they wanted,
Wandavision 2 and Doctor Strange 2 mashed up,You read that right. I think that the writers of Wanda and Doctor Strange sat together over coffee and wrote this script. Categorically aligned to the narrative of both characters with an endless string of twists and turns.
One of the darker marvel movies out there!,"This movie was amazing! The editing and actors where perfect in this movie! Loved every bit of it! I'm slowly getting into Marvel movies and this one could be my favorite by now! Don't miss out on this movie if you love a good story, great visuals and a good plot."
A mostly pleasing mess of a movie,"I'm not going to lie - this movie has great images, scary bits, quite a lot of cool drama, a lot of fan service and all kinds of stuffs to get excited about. BUT, it is incredibly messy-particularly in its first half-where things just sort of happen at a ridiculously breakneck pace without much in the way of structure or shape.

It feels *very* much like the first third in particular of the movie is missing a dozen scenes to fill in the gaps and rehandle the pacing. Wanda's first appearance and her big reveal are barely sketched out, the CGI on the first fight with the tentacled creature has extremely dubious bits, and there are big chunks which just don't really seem to connect. There are bits of foreshadowing that are just missing. It seems chopped around and apart.

But when it gets going it's really good fun. From about halfway through until the end it zooms along, and you mostly forget the problematic bits. It's a scarier movie and a more horror feeling movie than any of the others, but it's very enjoyable.

If you loved No Way Home, as I did, then this is simply nowhere near as masterly or beautifully assembled. That movie's like a perfect timepiece of construction. This is that movie if they cut forty minutes from the first half and it didn't entirely make sense.

An entertaining piece of Marvel, with some really interesting risks taken, but all in all, it was a bit of a mid-grade outing."
"Wow, what a stinker.","Has Marvel become too big to fail? It feels like they don't care anymore. This movie was a steaming turd made up of clichés, characters explaining the plot, continuity mistakes and terrible CGI. I assume the storyline started as a brainstorming session, and then they decided to use every idea from the brainstorming session in the order they were brainstormed."
One of the worst movie I even seen,"It is simply one of the worst movie I ever seen, acting very bad , scenario very ununderstandable , I strongly don't recommend this movie , worst Marvel movies ever It is even more a scary movie (a cheep one) then a super hero movie."
Action packed change of tone!,The movie was 90% action and a real thrill ride which is not to the films detriment due to the previous Movies/TV shows. Sam Rami's addition of a horror movie tone are excellent and set the movie apart from other Marvel films. This is probably the most gorey of all MCU properties which makes for some great action scenes. My only problem was that the movie was not long enough specifically the end which felt very rushed.
Great movie but the world needs a movie specifically for Wanda.,
Prepare for typical alternative universe confusion,
Strangely unsatisfying,"I was never much of a comic book fan growing up and was initially quite dismissive of Marvels Comic Universe, but came to develop a grudging admiration for the various Iron Man, Captain America and Avengers films.

These earlier MCU films elevated their stories beyond their childish comic book origins, took full advantage of CGI to weave an all together richer, more complex and highly engaging grand tapestry that was equally enjoyable to old and young alike.

This film feels much smaller, more comic book, aimed at young audiences and leaves a slightly unpleasant feminist activist after taste that seems to characterize all of Disney's recent offerings.

Ultimately a bit pointless, a nit boring, when they had all the ingredients for something special."
Really poorly written even the CGI is very low...actually everything is low !,"This wasn't what I expected. I loved all the latest Marvel I've seen (even the Eternals) but this one is really low on everything ! How does it gets an IMDB average rating above 7...I don't get it ! Especially when I read the reviews (mostly against the movie).

Next time I will wait to see the next Marvel on my big TV instead of a movie theater !"
Could have done better 😞,With all honesty this movie has massively underperformed. Boring central plot revolving around Wanda instead of Dr. Strange. Dr. Strange's character was so fast paced that a newbie watching the movie could not resonate with him. Using the same no way home formula here Dr.strange mentors America Chavez for some reason. Sam Raimi's approach to the film was lack-lustered by treating multiversal beings like puppets. Overall character introduction could have be done better considering it's a multiverse movie. Really dissatisfied with this product of marvel. Guys need to gear up or else other production houses will come up with something even more wholesome.
Crazy visuals and a gripping story **,"Watched the movie this afternoon at Kuzuha Mall in Osaka, Japan. For once we could see a movie early instead of being the last in the world.

Luckily the trailers didn't show all the good bits. The CGI is quite good as expected from Marvel movies. Sam Rami has made a great movie here. Our eyes are constantly bombarded with what is a visual feast with stunningly otherworldly looking universes that we visit. Enough twists and a solid enough story to keep us entertained for over two hours. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen."
The Madness in Doctor Strange,"Doctor strange in the multiverse of madness is surely above average, too much madness but less multiverse and less doctor strange which made it less entertaining than expected.

The good thing is that this movie somehow steps out of the classic MCU movie shape.

The dark vibes gave a whole new atmosphere to the movie when comparing to older MCU movies.

This movie was rich in visuals and fantasy, but still lacks an amount of plots."
Best MCU Movie til now,I don't know why people are getting disappointed for the cameos. We need to keep this in mind that this is a doctor strange movie. And its by far the best marvel movie on date for me. Sam Raimi's a gem.
Good Escape from Reality !!,"Just forget about script , story , logic etc. This movie has great action & amazing graphics . If you are looking for just entertainment & escape from reality for little more than 2 hrs. , this movie is for you.

Usually I like movies with good script , story , logic etc. But somehow I liked the pure madness of this movie !! ....."
It's MARVEL,"Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.

3.5⭐/5

Being fantastic but not to the expectation as given through the trailer. Obviously thrilling as all the Marvel movies specially as like heroic movies of Avengers characters.

The VFX was really magnificent especially in the scenes like travelling through multiverse and all was really cool.

The movie can't be divided into 2 halves because the screen operator just paused in between to make a break. The story was traveling in a single flow which didn't bored the viewers.

Presence of new characters in the Multiverse was just pretty awesome but many of them ended up with no time. Character discretion was well maintained by the director. There is no words to express about the making of the movie.

Coming to what happened as the negative as I felt was that the movie focused more on sentimental side of characters for building it to the climax where the climax was expected to be something more than that from the trailers and events.

There was no need of a huge expectation which is to be created by self but it's worth of theatre experience as a Visual and Audible treat.

@the_wanderer__soul."
Seriously Not Impressed,Stopped watching after 30-45 minutes. Looked like a desperate attempt to keep these movies going. Trying to top what they started with the previous series leading to end game. Powerful enough to fight Thanos but struggled in this movie. Disney screwed the pooch as RDJ would say. Can't wait to be disappointed with the new Thor as well. Should've stopped while you were ahead or spent more time with new writers to come up with better scripts. Good luck.
Lumehouse or Marvel?,Basically a horror movie with a poor script. Felt bad for the kids in the theatre. Trying to be something marvel is not. Felt like I went on a bad acid trip.
An excellent addition to the MCU!,"I chose to see this movie for Mother's Day with several of my family members. I am an MCU aficionado, but must admit that I did not see all of WandaVision! One of my daughters explained that there were a lot of references to the ending of that streaming TV show, and that I would have understood parts of Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness more if I had watched this series to its conclusion.

Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!"
Scarlet witch and the darkhold of madness,
"Well, at least the movie title is correct!!","I mean, it is called the Multiverse of Madness...what did yall expect...something not confusing, convoluted, and all over the place? Seemed more like a Scarlet Witch movie as Elizabeth Olsen definitely stole the show. Wasn't a big fan of the 1st Dr. Strange but it was an intro movie so I gave it a pass. This was good for what it was...a confusing mess."
A bit off theme but not bad,
Lmao just the right amount of madness,"It's not perfect, probably not for everybody, but it was a great freakin time

You need to be a fan of the MCU to follow everything; they don't hold your hand or dwell on introducing characters or backstories, but you won't care too much if you like Raimi, Doctor Strange or the dark fantasy genre

America Chavez is solid, acting is pretty good overall, action is great, the story works for the most part and it's genuinely scary at times

Definitely the most violent MCU product so far, some moderately gore and... creative murders

Honestly after seeing this twice, the second time in 3D, this is definitively a masterpiece. I don't expect everyone to fully embrace the wildly oscillating tone but the cinematography was epic, the story is strong, it's exciting, fun and gorgeous- even in 3D, which I was initially hesitant about

I would highly recommend this to any MCU fan, and that they witness it in a theater if possible."
Christian parents won't like this,"If you are a devout Christian, many of these themes will be unsettling to you. It was extremely intense, dealt graphically with witch craft, possession, demonic themes, all in a mentally ill/drug like condition.

Other than that, it was all over the place and didn't have a great story line."
It's a great movie but it's not perfect,
Trash,
Boring and unrealistic,
Dr Strange & the decline of Marvel?,"Being an avid marvel movie watcher for over a decade, I feel sick to my stomach at whats happening to the franchise.

The unnatural push of ulterior agenda is so blatant that it's screaming in your face.

I'll let the viewers decide, but, for me the agenda push will be the end of marvel."
"Wanda, just Wanda, sigh","Wanda annoys me so much, I forgot that she was in this because I had only seen a short teaser and understood it to be a continuation of the multiverse elements of no way home. It was so annoying. All of Wanda's motives from Civil War onwards have been so convoluted, whiny and confusing, she honestly makes women look bad. Can we PLEASE get some halfway decent female characters? It 2022!"
Hmmm,"Well it was all a bit silly, wasn't it... visually spectacular as you would expect but plot devices with which I struggled to suspend my disbelief. Fantastic performance from Miss Gomez, definitely one to watch but sadly tired and laboured from everyone else."
It's sinister on it's own. Marvel went to the dark side.,"I love that it's a change of pace from the average super-hero movie. But you might have your expectations changed because it's a complete different beast. This movie brings a mix of visual effects, with lots of witchcraft and Magic, and scary scenes.

They have also added a few exciting moments in the addition of new characters. That's the super hero side, the Marvel side we all love. This Next Phase of Marvel is weird, and all super heroes get a boost in power that it feels like they could single handed my beat Thanos by themselves, the infinite stone saga is no longer relevant. We are talking Gods and Multiverse Travel, and planets with the same characters and different personalities, it's a mess on it's own.

But going back: The movie starts on a very weird pace, and you don't seem to understand it until about 25-30 mins later. But then it just becomes a constant chase from the villain to the supposedly ""hero"". I love that they explored other universes. That was cool and refreshing. But the movie quickly turned into a different kind of it's own scary super hero movie s genre. The Villain is powerful, maybe too powerful, and sometimes it can feel like it has no weaknesses.

But overall, go with an open mind, you might be delighted, surprised, but not completely disappointed. It's what we needed and not what we wanted."
Horrible Movie,I fell asleep in this movie. I'm a big Marvel fan but this movie was very generic. Comedy was very lame and it was mostly just noise. Not a strong storyline to begin with. I'd recommend saving your money and watch it online rather than going to the theater.
Sam Rami!,"This director knows what Marvel needs! He has given the MCU a push in the right direction. Sick and tierd of MCU and Disney making everything stupid and clowning around. It's about time someone made a much darker film with less humour and more of an almost horror vibe to it.

Brilliant film, brilliant director."
Please Wanda don't be dead,
"Should have been ""Doctor Strange vs Scarlett Witch""","Not one of the good marvel films.

The movie was hyped and didn't give much as compared to other films.

There is no WOW factor in this movie.

I gave an extra star only for Benedict and Elizabeth.

The movie should give an equal credit to Elizabeth on posters and title too."
Very underwhelming,"Definitely not my favorite Marvel movie out of the bunch. Definitely not even close to being on of my favorite superhero movies period. The film had way to many slow pace stretches that caused some of the people in my group even fall asleep. Additionally, the movie felt like it had an overwhelming amount of sfx where they felt unnecessary. Finally, many of us simply didn't like a beloved character becoming the ""bad guy""."
Boring to death,
Poor storyline,"This movie doesn't give the thrilling feeling like marvel movies. The story flowed very poorly and I never felt connected with the movie. Acting was alright and met expectations overall. However, the story was poorly done and predictable. People are just rating it high because its Marvel and Doctor Strange is a classic. Don't go out of your way for this."
Movie concept was quite predictable and boring,"Marvel should grow on its basic child directions and kind to make some mature content if it want to capture future superhero market.

Ending was very disappointing and it was my total time waste."
I slept through this mind numbingly awful movie,I had so many expectations from this movie but my expectations were let down big time because this was the worst thing i've paid for all year. The entire movie was a scam and at this point Marvel isn't even trying tbh. They just throw whatever bunch of random characters they have lying around to create a $Hït show of a movie.
Multiverse of GOATness,"Guys, it seems everyone is trying to compare this film to No Way Home. The reactions are making me think that no way home might actually be overrated from people who weren't even born when the first Spidermans were rolling :) Don't get me wrong i think no way home is awesome but this Dr Strange has nothing to do with Spiderman and is absolutely astonishing. Storytelling, characters, strong connection to the GOAT mcu and at least five past titles, visuals, emotional impact, full of huge surprises and deliver for the longterm followers. Big thank you to the people involved in making it <3! Looking forward for more =)"
One of marvel worst movies,"I had to say that my expectations where way bigger For this movie Very very linear, This is a movie for 12 year kids The rating for this movie in IMDb should be 4 Not 7.5 ( fake)"
Good but also very dissapointing,Why Marvel is proving that they are ober after endgame i mean whole plot was like from wanda vision in that series we see that she has now realised but now after seeing movie she is not even anti hero she is killing innocents for children that dont even exist also its not a doctor strange movie it shoul be wanda vision 2 vfx was good no doubt acting of all the characters were also good but its sad too storyline after endgame except loki everything is downfall i am giving these stars because i was huge marvel fan but donw know how far.
Was this the conclusion to WandaVision,Fun movie... but I thought this was supposed to be a Doctor Strange movie. I felt like he was a secondary character in his own movie. I mean it was a great conclusion to the Disney+ show of WandaVision which was nice.
An absolute epic,
"Okay, So The Multiverse isn't JUST Predictable Cameos","I admit, I think multiverses are boring and suck because they nullify stakes. I think that Spider-Man fanfic from a while ago is a convoluted mess bound yo rehash moments and cash in on nostalgia. I was very concerned about MoM, but it was pretty awesome.

This is a horror movie, period. A supernatural slasher which pulls no punches - it is visceral, and violent, and carries consequence. At heart, this is a Sam Raimi movie not just because of POV shots and Dutch angles, but because it is a movie about boundless evil that creates an unstoppable force of madness, and that really works well with the canon. Despite a rocky first act to set up a lot, it all pays off really well. To me more than Marvel, it definitely channels a lot of 80s horror like Evil Dead (obvs), Elm St. And even Friday the 13th and Alien. It works really surprisingly well using the multiverse and Marvel setpieces to be both surprising and entertaining, and spooky in that schlocky kind of way. It also works as an MCU movie in ways that are both interesting and moves forward the MCU itself.

I'm not sure how this would play for general audience - this is a very genre movie in a genre which hasn't seen success in decades. But I think it kicked ass."
Very Intense But Some of the Best of Marvel,"The first part of the movie felt more like a regular Marvel movie. Then, around the halfway point, it suddenly dove head-first into insanity! This is a good thing in my opinion, though. I love the new territory the MCU has been exploring in phase 4 (particularly the sifi/horror of late). It really worked in this movie, and I highly recommend it!"
Poor Direction,"This felt more like a DC production - like something Sony did with one of their mediocre directors.

Overall story was ok America Sanchez (new character) is great Everything else around Wanda was not great."
Avoid,"Great cast, doing the best they can with what they have to work with and the nod to another movie genre is good, but the movie is a bit all over the place and, worst of all, the whole thing is smothered in Disney's saccharine and cheese sauce."
Same old story,"Just so predictable, the storyline was weak and lacked real substance. Maybe children would enjoy it for the CGI. Overall disappointed considering I enjoyed the first. Wouldn't not recommend but I'm not gonna be tell all my mates to run out and watch it. Feels like marvel just keep spewing out generic garbage as a cash grab."
Love it,This movie was anther big suprise after spider man! Just watched it last night and I smiled the whole movie. My marvel watching just started. The visuals and just how much creativity is in this movie is just awesome.
Lazy,It didn't feel like a lot of effort was put into the making of this movie when you compare it to some of the others. It was ok to watch but I'm not even interested in watching it again. Probably never will.
Too much Doctor Strange not enough Stephen Strange,
Absolutely floored - one of the best marvel movies ever made,"I live in Perth and managed to see an advance screening tonight and I had to get my thoughts out there.

This movie is absolutely incredible, easily marvel's best since endgame. The performances are great all round, but Benedict cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen give phenomenal performances, the best out of their respective films in the MCU. The story, while not the most complex out there, is nevertheless gripping, entertaining and, at times, emotional. The action rivals infinity war and Shang chi for the most thrilling set pieces and the humour is for once almost perfectly balanced with the film's more serious moments.

Along with several great surprises this film is a must see and easily in my top 5 comic book films."
What,
Disappointing,Very disappointed in the lack of superhero action. Got very dark quick. Didn't realize that she would turn into the devil herself. Could have been better.
The worst Marvel movie i ever saw.,"Felt like watching some movie from 2002. At times i thought i was watching a parody. It seems to me they did this only for the $, should have stopped at Infinity war. Honestly why force it?"
Simply enjoyable,"Some didn't enjoy it but if anyone wants to be entertained and forget about the standard straight forward drama movies this is the one to watch. Visually it's amazing, all effects are spot on and the acting it's all good which you don't see very often these days. I think some harsh critics maybe forgot how to let go and simply be entertained."
MASTERPIECE.PERIODT,"This was definitely one of the most creative marvel movies i have ever seen, it was fun, to the point, horror, not filled with too many cameos(therefore no old nostalgia), all and all it was actually a great movie and i do not understand why it could be hated. I have never seen cgi like this before. The most attractive scenes that absolutely made me implode were the mirror dimension and Scarlett witch ending the illuminati. Critics gonna hate for no reason ig..."
Great Movie but I have a few problems,
This film was a travesty,Disney is ruining marvel. This film was terrible. Don't waste your time watching this. Such a waste of time. It was a joke just like the Wandavision. I could not wait for this to end. Brutal.
I had a boring time,"What a waste of brilliant actors on chaotic and messy script. Quality was a huge departure from previous releases. This trash script bungled well established and beloved characters, how do you do that?! This was my least favourite MCU release of all time, and I really liked Eternals which says something."
Very boring and week,"I didn't like this movie at all. I loved the first part of Doctor Strange, but the second part is so boring and weak. The actress who plays America Chavez is mediocre at best. The script lacks creativity and the movie overall reminds of a light version of cheap horror flick. This was disappointment and waste of time. I found myself fast-forwarding in many scenes of the movie as they were needlessly slow and uneventful or repetitious."
Pure madness,"Marvel movies lately have been very hit or miss but I can say doctor strange managed to hit that good but not perfect territory. The action and effects are next level, and most characters are likeable and well written, well...most...And I feel some parts could have been done better. But at the end of the day, I had fun, would gladly see again."
Doctor Strange became a Horror Movie...,
LACKING SOME STORY WRITING,
It's a masterpiece,"A somewhat messy script and messy film don't stop this mystical film from being the best it can be. Great cinematography,visuals,acting, and story and action help this film land it's place as one the best marvel movies of all time."
Perfect,"Michael Waldron and Sam Raimi delivered the goods! Specially the Illuminati scene, was just perfect. And also the last post credit scene was really hilarious."
One star because was Dr Strange in It.,"This has to be one of the most incompetent written stories from the whole Marvel universe. I could not sincerely believe this is the story up until the end of the movie. What a ridiculous, pointless, stupid, incompetent screen writing.

A movie has to have a decent story, not only VFX. Good vfx can do every decent student these days, don't forget that ! Ridiculous that these movies that run on such a high budget are using scripts literally written on napkins. Shame on you Marvel and Disney for putting out this kind of trash."
Multiverse of Badness,"What is this theme night? Why? Who approved this? A lame attempt to make this a collection of all horror films. First off, the premise is Wanda wanting her imaginary kids so she's willing to kill thousands of people from multiple universes to live in a reality where they exist? It just kept getting worse and worse. The third eye thing threw me over the edge. So dumb. I love marvel films by the way and this one makes me feel like they lost their touch."
It made no sense. One of the worst MCU movie,
Not great,"The whole movie felt like a massive joke. Dr Strange as a character needs a better movie The character development was non existent, scenes did not make sense. Pretty bad."
"Good, but could have been great","The entire Scarlett Witch plot feels like an overcorrection for her misuse in all the previous films. However she is not very compelling and her motives were poorly written and seemed very similar to Kaecillius' . The ""horror"" aspects would've been much more convincing with an actual villain.

As per usual with Marvel, the Illuminati fan service was cheap. The movie was at its best when the focus was Doctor Strange and America Chavez. Xochitl Gómez was great as America Chavez, even though, through no fault of her own, some CGI scenes made her look clumsy.

You can see throughout the movie where execs got involved and pushed unnecessary additions/changes."
Most Comic Booky Marvel Movie Yet.,"This movie was just flat out awesome. Yes there's one or two scenes where a character stands there when they should be running, but that's in every movie.

I really really hate seeing all these negative reviews for the worst reasons or no reasons at all. I get being disappointed when you expect something else, that's what happened with me and WandaVision, but don't take it out on the movie. WandaVision was awesome. Did I expect a lot more big Marvel reveals? Yes, and that was disappointing, but once I thought of the series as its own story, I realized it was great. It's the same thing here. Some people apparently expected this to be like a continuation of What If? It's not an anthology, it's a movie. There wasn't a ton of universes we saw, and that's fine. If we spent the whole movie jumping between universes, the stakes would be lower and the characters wouldn't have as much development.

Now to address the other concerns. The truly idiotic, bigoted complaints. I've seen multiple now that complain about the ""wokeness"" of this movie and those people are imbeciles. America Chavez has been around for over a decade, and yes, she's mixed race, and yes, she's queer. It's not like they created a character to check off those boxes for this movie, the picked a character that makes a ton of sense. Also, why would is it bad to have another non-white character? Why would it be bad to have queer representation? Why can't a movie have a female protagonist without it being ""woke"".

Regardless, the reason why they're bigoted idiots, isn't because of their bigotry in general, although that would be enough, it's because there's literally zero discussion of Chavez's sexuality in this movie. She had rainbow pin on her jacket, and that's it. For all we know, the MCU Chavez could easily be straight! Also, she's from another universe! She never even discusses her race or ethnicity, besides talking in Spanish! It's truly absurd that anyone would think Chavez in this movie is a ""woke"" character. Get over yourself and quit playing the victim.

The other complaint I've seen is the motivation for the bad guy is weak. I got that at first. I thought it was weak pretty early in the movie, but then I realized the motivation was literally powered by evil magic. It's not like the character just really wanted something, they were literally corrupted. We've even seen it before in a Marvel series. It's not a big leap and makes a lot of sense when you keep that in mind.

If you liked the boundary pushing of No Way Home, you're not a bigot, and you don't have an anthology expectation for this movie, you'll love it. It's literally the most comic booky movie Marvel has made yet. The awesome multiverse stuff we got in No Way Home, is just beginning, and this movie doesn't shy away from showing us BIG characters in other universes, and it isn't scared of killing important characters in alternate universes. It's a blast. Just sit and enjoy."
Interesting movie,What can i say. The first movie was great. I am not sure what happened in the past three years other then people are losing their mind. Evident the woke message will continue. I'm done with Holyrood. Decent story poor delivery.
Disaster,"Disaster of a movie. Probably the worst Marvel movie ever! Can't believe the average rating here is 7.6!

I'm giving 4 only because of some good CG and a few funny moments."
No purpose.,"The Multiverse had an opportunity to explore potential and exciting tales of alternate universes... but it failed. Even though some great references were added and cameos, it does not make up for the weak story line. The America character can be completely written out of the story and save yourself a half hour of non-sense in the movie. I understand equality must be addressed, but is it? When you kill off the male characters so easily to demonstrate an all girl fight scene?! Great characters and iconic comic book superheroes written off so easily to satisfy individualism. Wanda character overall was interpreted amazingly."
"We stayed an hour, trying to understand what was going on.......then left.","Disappointed We thought it was going to be exceptional.

Just too bad we couldn't understand what was happening from the very start.

My husband fell asleep. Too confusing. Too many stories. After an hour we gave up and walked out of the theater.

This is only for heavy duty Marvel fans. Ones that actually know what is going on.

We like Benedict Cumberbatch so much...... but not in this."
Amazing pictures,"The pictures and scenes/locations of this movie are overwhelming! Glad I went too see it. It's very different to other MCU movies but in a very positive way. No 10/10 because you can always do it better, but I was close to it."
"Formulaic , fast paced, and decent acting","For an MCU movie, it checks all the boxes of effects, CGI, and pace.

Unfortunately it's so formulaic in hoisting an ultimate villain (no spoiler here) such as they did with Thanos and of course the obligatory speech about what a hero can do gives the villain time attack first.

The crossover characters do unite some future projects and the Sony/Disney machine united, but their appearance is brief, overly overconfident, and ultimately predictable.

The acting was fairly good, I'd say an 8 as Cumberbatch and Olsen can bring it and Xochitl Gomez is still a bit new, so her acting will grow. A lot of delay before she says anything and the audience had some groans.

Overall a 6, as you may or may not go to 3-D to watch it, but it's better in 3-D with many of the effects.

Let's just say Doctor Strange could tell the Illuminati ""I told ya so""."
Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness really lives up to the word sequel,"Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness really lives up to the word sequel. Many sequel movies end up ruining the story and many times the companies end up restarting the story and we have seen this with many superhero movies and action movies. For example movies whose sequels ended their stories in failure like Transformers, Pirates of the Caribbean, Die Hard, Terminator, They are that example of killing a good story. Dr. Strange was the opposite with this sequel, the incredible special effects, the music by Danny Elfman, the direction by Sam Raimi, the cinematography and how many things well done make this movie give it the honor of being a good sequel. And I could also say that Elizabeth Olsen is undoubtedly a great actress and has shown it once again in her role as Wanda / Scarlet Witch. And obviously Benedict Cumberbatch is not far behind, he is undoubtedly an actor of pure good quality. Both really show the quality of actors that they are in this sequel."
Did not live up to expectations,
Marvel meets Bollywood,"I don't know where to begin. It's pike watching a Bollywood themed Marvel movie. The acting, storyline and screenplay, all them were below average compared to a Marvel standard movie."
Well that's 2+ hours I'll never get back...,"I'm so glad I did not spend money to see this in the theatre...! I love the Marvel movies and have seen them all and have never been disappointed....until I sat through this confusing, convoluted , uninspiring mess of a movie. It's simply over the top with.... I don't know what to call it. It does start off a bit strange similar to the most recent Spider-Man movie with the three Spidermen, each from a different universe. However in short order it goes off the rails..and heads south, in a hurry...! My wife, daughter and I all three watched it together and kept shaking our heads wondering what in the hell is coming next....!

Nope, didn't like it and don't recommend it. But to each their own...."
Madness.,"Enjoyed Dr Strange. Very strange lost the plot at one point but still good fun, however if the worst actress, sorry actor you can't call them actresses anymore in the history of movies, Charlize Theron is coming into the Marvel universe I'll never watch any movie she's in. Spoiled the end punchline for me. Devastated."
A solid mcu movie,
Seriously the worst MCU movie yet.,
I hope there's an universe in which this movie is actually good.,
Doctors Strange 2 Review,"Marvel owns the most anticipated film sagas of the year, we already know that. The problem is that the big bosses at Disney know that too, and are taking advantage of it to profit more and more, without the proper commitment to us, the fans.

In ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" we are presented with a ""camouflage"" beautiful to look at, making, perhaps, the most fanatical fans or the disconnected ones not realize the real catastrophe that is this movie. Benedict Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange) delivers once again what is expected, nothing too much but maintaining his standard of quality, Xochitl Gomez (America Keys) and Benedict Wong (Wong) have a simple performance, which is not horrible but goes unnoticed for sure, even more if we consider the poor use of their characters. With Elizabeth Olsen (Wanda) we have the highlight of the movie, with an exquisite performance that, with the help of director Sam Raimi, gave the movie a fearful content, making me really afraid of the Sorceress in some moments, once again Elizabeth Olsen is magnificent!

And it is with Sam Raimi himself that the second and last positive point of this film occurs: the personality imposed in the script.

Unlike many directors and employees of Marvel, Sam Raimi does not bend to the gears and standards imposed by Marvel itself, the film has the director's face and he takes advantage of the freedom given to him, giving the film more horror, making us often question the film's rating.

But even with this ""freedom"", Raimi can't escape Marvel's clichés and clichés in certain moments, as well as all Marvel's films. They treat us like loyal and comfortable customers who always want more of the same, without surprises or contradictions.

As one character in the film herself said, ""In the Multiverse there are solutions to all problems."" And that's exactly what Marvel seems to be doing and enjoying, taking advantage of the immensity of this universe and serving the fan with everything he has always wanted, even if this requires sacrificing excellence and often consistency. It seems to me a desperate search for screams and applauses (well, we all know this means more profit) without caring about the quality of the films, after all, when everything is possible, nothing else matters.

In the feature film, at key moments, the search for screams and applause is explicit, trying to recreate what once worked in ""Avengers: Endgame"" and ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"". However, this time, without the narrative coherence and excellence seen before, ending up in just a simple search for acclaim (which unfortunately was met, after all the audience goes into delirium in scenes where my only reaction was ""What's going on here?"").

In an attempt to present us with a Multiverse of ""craziness"", it actually just shows how disappointing this adventure can be, giving us only a glimpse of what could have been, impressing us with such different and chaotic universes (after all, who hasn't fallen in love with the Ink universe moment or the comic book one?), But in the end we are faced with the comfort zone and nothing out of the norm, an ""ordinary"" universe where the big differences are in the smallest details (walking on red and pizza balls, really?).

At all times in the film, people are placed to explain what is happening, as if they were ""chewing"" the information so that we don't have to think too much; at every moment someone always tells us where everyone is, how they got there, and how to find a way out. When something important happens, there is always someone willing to explain what happened in detail, as if they were explaining it to an unsuspecting colleague, even if they were explicitly explaining it to us, the spectators.

The CGI tries to camouflage all this by showing us beautiful art and universes, and I confess, watching it in the cinema was really a beautiful experience, however, even in its only attempt to enchant us, Marvel fails, for some times it was possible to see the green background without any effort.

The first arc of the feature was one of the worst movie starts I have ever seen, simply chaotic but not in a good way, in a disorganized and uncontrolled way, you barely know what is going on and what do you know? Not even Marvel themselves knew, they just crammed in a bunch of baseless information and dumped it in our faces with the premise of the ""Multiverse of Madness"". Now, Madness is one thing, Sloppiness is another. We don't even have time to empathize with America, she just shows up needing help, and that's all she needs for Strange to defend her to the death. After all, who wouldn't give their life, their house, their temple, and their sanity to a girl you just met, who you can't trust, whose only arguments are ""I need help""? I honestly didn't care about the girl during the whole movie, I thought Wanda could do whatever she wanted with her.

Speaking of Strange, here we see a really strange case, after all, who is he really? The Doctor Strange from movie 1? The one from Infinity War? The one from Spider-Man? Or the one we have just been introduced to? I was confused, they don't look like the same person to me, did Marvel simply ignore the continuity of a person's personality just to fit into their disjointed scripts? Well, the answer is yes, Steven Strange unfortunately doesn't follow his personality because even they don't know how he should act in situations anymore. But then you will say ""People change with time"", Ok, we agree on this, but the situation clearly is not that, our dear Doctor is taking different decisions in each movie he is in, in a way that makes me question what happens between one movie and another for him to change so much.

But let's talk about the main premise of hero movies, the fights! E... They are disappointing, unfortunately. The battle scenes are almost dynamic at times, but they don't work, because for the most part it's two mages face to face, fighting at a distance with spells, where the only action is them making faces and mouths.

And I won't even comment much on what everyone, even the most ignorant, realized, the poor humor of the feature, gee, it brought me a feeling of shame in certain scenes, it seems that it was thought by a child of 7 years, jokes totally lame and placed in horrible moments, it hurts.

In summary, the movie is a cluster of random characters making jokes and whining while fighting in weak fights covered in CGI and special effects, where their only effort is to make a bad face.

The post-credit scene placed for only one purpose: to show that there is more to come.

And it works, we understand and wonder about what may come next, but even this scene behaves in a similar way as the whole movie, running too fast and for no reason, Steven doesn't even wonder if he should trust or not, just more information dumped in our faces.

It seems to me like a bad joke from Marvel to us, they don't care anymore about the quality of their movies, they make everything fast and fill it with fan service just to cheer and ignore the quality that it should have, after all, only the final movies should be really good right? Once again they take advantage of the fanaticism and idolatry previously conquered and abuse it to gain more profit, filling the movie with effects, non-stop fighting and uncontrolled fan service.

Marvel is worrying a lot more about selling than convincing!"
Sam Raimi butchered this,"I love Wanda she's my favourite MCU character, i love Elizabeth Olsen. I Love Dr Strange and i love what Benedict has brought to the MCU. I stanned Raimis Spiderman movies. But oh my god. Sam Raimi was the worst choice for this. The directing is horrible. How is Sam making AMAZING actors be so so so bad? It's so cringey i almost can't watch it. I'm so angry and sad. The most cringe and unnescessary exposition lines, the horrible and awkwardly timed score, the awkward editing and the awful SFX. Ooff. I feel sad for the actors. They should have let Matt Shakman direct this."
Enjoyable despite the constant condescending of the titular character,"The movie starts off quite enjoyable, with the kind of VFX and feel from the original Doctor Strange film. As it progresses, the fan service and exploration are enough to captivate the audience and keep you hooked. However, it seems to rely heavily on its horror elements after this, which are moderate but still great.

The constant lack of ability every Doctor Strange shows makes the audience believe he is almost nothing without the time stone. Simultaneously, the film takes every opportunity to demonstrate Strange's character flaws but not really his strengths. The plot moves forward without him really doing anything except encouraging other characters, making him feel pointless.

There is also a lack of consideration or care for the villains motivations not due to explanation, but due to their change happening all offscreen.

A solid entry to the MCU which I credit for daring ti deviate slightly from the formula that plagues these movies, but the fan service and horror elements cannot hide the conflict the movie suffers determining its main character."
Absolutely marvelous and 10 tomes better than No way Home. The movie focuses on story not on cameos,Perfectly done to explain how powerful The Scarlet Witch is. Cameos were Perfectly balanced. The movie actually has a story unlike NWH which was so simple like there is a villain with no proper motives and 3 spiderman came for fan service which I actually enjoyed but the story telling of MOM was too good. Definitely not the best movie but still it gets a 10/10.
Not enough Multiverse and not enough Doctor Strange,"No character development. Despite the entertaining visuals, the plot is fairly chaotic, and the acting & dialogue are inconsistent. They should've let Sam Raimi do his thing and release the actual cut of the film. The ending of the film felt rushed and leaves a few questions unanswered. A big disappointment overall. They did Scarlet Witch dirty when the arch had so much potential. The whole story is overdone and Marvel could have done something much more unique. In conclusion whilst it wasn't the worst marvel film it wasn't the best."
"Good Idea, poor execution. Other multiverse movies did it better.","Plot (1/2) Visuals (1/2) Characters (1/2) Sound (1/2) ""IT"" Factor (0.5/2) Total (4.5/10)

Plot - The overall concept is a good one but not well executed. I enjoyed the darker side of the characters and their actions but side events severely distracted from the main plot.

Visuals - We've seen most of the same visuals as before but with multiverse, I expected more. Certain set designs felt cheap, like I was watching a recording of a theatre performance.

Characters - Great lead performances from Cumberbatch and Olsen. Gomez was purely a McGuffin but did well with what she was given. She should have been better introduced and given more scenes to connect. Other characters were just haphazardly introduced and assumed that you have seen several other Marvel shows/movies. I laughed during one introduction scene (I don't think it was supposed to be funny).

Sound - Nothing special. The music scene was a good attempt but felt gimmicky given the context.

IT - The vibe felt flat with little depth. It was like we were mixing a horror film with the upbeat of Spider-Man plus a younger Kate Bishop as a sidekick. Many other multiversal movies have executed this better."
Refreshing Change for the MCU,"Multiverse of Madness strays from the MCU formula ... and it is a refreshing change. I love Marvel heroes yet it is nice that the MCU doesn't rely upon cookie cutter plot lines. The acting was great, sets were spectacular, special effects were innovative. The story line was original and there was even a Zombie ... albeit a ""good Zombie"". The audience knew the MCU and seemed to appreciate the film. Go see it."
"Definitely a ""What If""",
All right,Dr Strange is absolutely my favourite avenger but this film was not what I was expecting. The story line is weak and quite disappointing. I am giving it still a 6 because of some good scenes but overall it was only all right.
The Film was good with some unexpected goosebumps but didn't happen as expected,The Film is good ... But it may dissatisfy or disappoint you with some of the unexpected cameo appearances and deaths... And there are lots of deaths as compared to other MCU movies .... The Film also has lots of character sketch changes ....... and the Film is a bit of gore and violance.
Mediocre,"Not bad not great. It was just ok. Plot was kind of thin and the dialogue wasn't great. Had enough action to keep my attention though. It wasn't great action, but good enough. Basically like everything else in phase 4, it's pretty forgettable."
Macaroni and Cheese,This movie was way too colorful for me. The minute I thought it was getting good I was let down at the end. This was a huge disappointment and not at all worth my two hours that were wasted or the cost of the movie.
Visually Stunning and Undeniably Strange,"Not as much multiverse as we wanted, but what Sam Raimi brought to the table allows for the film to stand out above the rest as its the most visually stunning and pleasing MCU film to date. As we explore the horrors of desire and grief and the beauty of the unknown and self acceptance, this one's an A+ for me and for anyone who wants camp, horror, and a good time with Wizards, a Witch, and wonderfully creative journey into the bizarre and madness of the multiverse."
"Bummer, not the MCU I'm used to...","Benedict Cumberbatch is one of my favorite actors, and Doctor Strange is my favorite MCU character, but I won't be watching this one again. I agree with others that this should've been a Wanda movie, and once it turned into a horror movie, I wanted to turn it off. Just not my cup of tea, and that's super disappointing."
Only one end credit scene,Technically there's two but the first one plays into the story line and the second is an inside joke. Stay if you want. I loved this movie. There are many funny scenes and some serious moments that were funny. Pay close attention to facial expressions it'll make sense when you watch the movie. Cheers :)
Your expectations are your problems.,"An extremely average movie. It's not what you'd expect from a movie with the title ""Multiverse of Madness.""

The graphics are bad, the movie jumps from one place to another, the editing is torn in places, the action scenes are bad."
The multiverse is a madness,"To start with anything about Doctor Strange in the Multiverse Of Madness, it's impossible not to mention Sam Raimi's brilliant and amazing direction. This man shines and plays here as if he were on a playground.

Its chaotic camera and shrewd solutions give the Multiverse of Madness the perfect seasoning for this salad. While it's not a horror movie, there are numerous horror elements in the movie throughout its scrolling. There are some script flaws, few, but there are.

It's short, but Raimi manages to deliver dense, cohesive content, which is great for those familiar with the MCU.

Here we don't need introductions, because everyone is family. From that point, the director leads the film to an epic and tireless adventure in its very well spent 2 hours of screen.

Unlike Spider-Man No Way Home, which explored the Multiverse and had a lot of nostalgia and fan service support, Multiverse of Madness differs by not relying on these pillars of Marvel's latest multiversal adventure. There are special appearances, but the film is not grounded in them.

There's a duel sequence made from the pure juice of creativity that Sam can offer. A fight with musical notes was the last thing I could imagine seeing in a superhero movie. Sam Raimi not only implements the idea, but does it well - and very well!

Talking about Cumberbatch's performance is raining on the wet, he doesn't try too hard to deliver a great performance and bring his character to life. Elizabeth Olsen is not far behind and delivers a lot in her role of Wanda and Scarlet Witch, which was only possible due to the importance her character has in the plot of this new phase of the MCU. Oh! You will fall in love with America Chavez and want to take her home because she is so cute and charismatic that she is the girl played by the young and talented Xochitl Gomez.

Yes, there's the Marvel imprint of storytelling on this film, but it's still a great addition to your studio portfolio. Full of surprises, with a director at his level and an intrinsic cast, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a movie worth watching.

But be aware that because it is a piece of a larger puzzle, you need to be aware of the other works in this cinematic universe to experience the film in its entirety."
Potential wasted,"The movie had so much potential, wasted to please Disney audience. I can feel that Sam Riami had other plans for the movie, a serious tone which was trimed deliberately to fit into Marvel standards.

However, it still manages to pull it off with so many easter eggs and fan service. Worth the ticket but not worth the hype."
Very dark,I do not expect this much demonic activity and it upset me very much. I also felt like it had a lot of instances that didn't make sense or logical scenarios. Scarlet witch also had way too much power. I did understand her love and extreme actions to find her children.
Great Disney Film Trash Marvel Movie,"If you enjoy 101 Dalmatians then you will love this film, if you wanted to watch an amazing story about Marvel Dr. Strange then this movie is hot trash, Captain Marvel was better than this and I thought Disney couldn't do worse to a Marvel character than that. I guess Moonknight is going to follow suit."
Didn't like it too much,
Wrong movie title,"Common the movie title should be scarlet witch and her madness. Literally, what's strange doing in the film is very strange. Marvel should really focus on it's story lines."
Have a read of this,"NON SPOILER REVIEW

You have the master of the mystic arts - Doctor Strange - and then you have the master of the horror arts - Sam Raimi. This leaves us with a visually stunning movie that does indeed creep up on you at some points. Using the Scarlet Witch as the character to introduce the horror theme into the MCU was a really good idea as she seems to fit so well. There are a few jump scares here and there which provides a fresh new approach to the MCU. With meticulous cinematography, Sam Raimi does make this movie jump out at you, whether its through the use of sound or just some gruesome moments on screen, you will be gripped to your seat. With some amazing VFX and a good performance from the cast, old and new, we are left with another top of the class entry to the MCU.

A final few things to note. The 'cameos' in this movie didn't pack quite the punch that I was expecting for a movie that was about the multiverse. This may be due to the limited amount of time we had with these characters but I do understand why Marvel did this because the title of the movie does have 'Doctor Strange' in it and not any other names so focusing on the main character is the main role of this movie. Another thing that I was disappointed about was the score. Don't get me wrong, Danny Elfman did a pretty good job but i just wanted to hear more of the Doctor Strange theme by Micheal Giacchino from the first movie.

Ratings:

Performance - 9.5 Action - 9 Pacing - 10 VFX - 9.5 Story - 8 Score - 7

Overall - 8.8/10."
interesting movie,
disappointed with this film,"My review of doctor strange the multiverse of madness:

Firstly this film was a sequel to the TV series Wandavision which some people may not have watched. It was focused too much on Wanda rather than doctor strange so might as well have been a Wanda film. Doctor strange was just there. This is disappointing because the first doctor strange strange film was good and I really liked his character but this film wasn't about him at all.

Secondly the plot was awful and pacing of the film was all over the place. The multiverse was barely featured in this film let alone being mad. They could have done so much more with the multiverse, with the TV series building up around the idea something is wrong with the multiverse but this never happened.

Thirdly, the acting was bad and and there was no character development. America is a random character who I won't go into depth about as it is spoilers.

Good points about the film: Very good soundtrack (won't go into depth to avoid spoilers) and very much in the directorial style of Sam Rami including the CGI which was just like drag me to hell.

Overall: disappointing film don't watch. It doesn't add anything to the bigger picture of the MCU. Only one detail is actually significant but not really that important in the grand scheme of things. 3/10 would not recommend to a friend."
Starts slow but picks up as it goes on,
Couldn't sit through the entire movie.,"Halfway through the movie I was so fed up, I just left the theatre. It's so poorly written, no seriousness in the scenes at all. No coherence between the different scenes. It felt rushed, no time was given to understand the magnitude of a particular event.

It felt as if some high school student made this film, it was so casual.

This is probably my last Marvel film in a theatre. They've lost their sheen."
Lazy...just plain lazy...,"Not sure where to start. For such a big box office movie, it's quite surprising the number of amateur-hour mistakes; 1) Sloppy camera transitions, and i mean REALLY bad. Very disjointed and noticeably so.

2) PC culture in full swing. Girl power/Girl-on-girl/Latino heroes/Hijabis in church so on so forth. If you felt Captain Marvel was nauseating with it's forced messages then bring a vomit bag to this movie.

3) Lazy scriptwriting. Not to give away any spoilers, but let's just say the greatest mystery in Doctor Strange's universe is the level of coincidences. Even one of the characters casually makes this clear by saying something along the lines of ""oh, so you happened by chance to bump into the one person (out of literally trillions in the multiverse) who happened to be the villain?"" 4) Underpowered Strange. This is the man who fought against Thanos and looked into millions of probable outcomes to devise a strategy to defeat him, yet he barely had strength against the main villain. (yes he no longer has the time stone to aid him, but still, out of all the tricks he had in his sleeve he simply resorts to dragon ball-esque energy throwing and the odd punch-out here and there. Underwhelming to say the least.

Simply put, when you have literally the full multiverse at your disposal with the chance to introduce practically any character, this is literally every writers dream, they could have done incredible things with this script, alas instead we're just treated to CGI + PC galore for a few hours. Someone please hire new blood and fire these overpaid lazy producers."
Lots of missed potential but still an overall decent movie.,
A triumphant return for Raimi,"Sam raimi has one again proved that he can masterly direct a superhero film and I certainly hope that he'll be given more opportunities to do so in the future. Not to say that this flawless, though I believe that pretty all of the weaknesses was due to the writing."
Worst Marvel movie,
Wandavision Part 2,"I was excited to watch it, but after the I watched I'm disappointed now... Why Marvel? If they named it ""Wandavision Multiverse"" will be acceptable..."
Really wanted to love this movie,"I tried really hard to enjoy this movie. The first Dr. Strange was a great story and good visual effects! Sadly, just felt bored at moments in this new movie. The story wasn't very good...it felt a little Spider-Man 3 like to me. Kind of patched together with a ton of idea but, did not flow very well. Some of the effects didn't feel completely polished either. I was truly excited about this movie when it was announced. Only can wish what could of been with the original director..."
Right mix of madness!!!,"I just saw this movie over the weekend and I was not disappointed. Other than the unexpected twist and turns of the story, the cameos of other marvel personalities had undeniably contributed to its success!

Wanda needs her own movie at this pointand I hope marvel even goes as far as creating a Femme Fatal movie where Wanda can join Jean Grey, Storm, and Psylocke!"
crazy~ and i so so love it~,
"Different of what expecting, but still funny to watch","Gotta admit I'm a little disappointed of how they show us the multiverse, expected more weird worlds and more variants of our protagonists. Sadly, they didn't give us this, and I think the title of this movie could have been chosen better. Also bit sad that the struggle of my favourite superhero Dr. Strange were shadowed by the antagonist's struggle (that's the worst error for the script IMO) BUT I was genuinely surprised of how they introduced the horror components, the rythm of the movie thrilling me, and I seriously LOVED everything since the meeting of Sinister Strange. The protagonist finally showed us some original powers, far more interesting from the usually boring shield and wrist. I loved all the weird things here! Great soundtrack and direction.

I mean, I'm happy because some disappointment aside, I really enjoyed the movie and the 2 hours really have been flight like a rocket for me, and I usually sleep over other Marvel's movie lol. Really enjoyed the second watch too!

Also really better than the first movie, who was soulless."
Absolutely Ridiculous! Stupid horror witch and zombie movie that is full of enough nonsense to make you barf!,How do you go from a Marvel movie to a bizarre piece of sheit more akin to a horror movie than a super hero movie. It has made me aware to never watch a Sam Raami movie ever again.
"Madness?....Yes, multiverse not really.","Go into this movie with low expectations. I am personally a hard person to disappoint. But after seeing this I was disappointed. I love marvel and doctor strange is easily in my top five favorite super hero's. I feel that this move felt slightly rushed and the plot was nonexistent. The characters were stale and two dimensional. The trailer pretty much gives you 85% of what happens. Leaving only one maybe two surprises I wasn't impressed with. It was jam packed with action and a few attempts of horror. When watching this I had last Jedi vibes. What I mean is it feels like a lot happens that does not progress the movie nor does it develop any of the characters. I think marvel/Disney really dropped the ball with this one. For a movie called ""multiverse"" of madness there was not much multiverse going on. I feel as if they a lot of missed opportunities when it came to cameos and multiverse traveling. What if..? Series does it better. Elizabeth Olsen steals the show for sure and does an amazing job portraying the character. Honestly should have been called scarlet witch and the multiverse of madness. I guess Disney wasn't ready or willing to do that. Overall this movie fell flat and was watered down. Although Elizabeth Olsen does wonderful I fell her character did not develop with the story and goes in a circle. As for other characters I wish I could say the same but most are not important have no meaning to the MCU or the story. If they were going to do a ""multiverse"" movie they should have overloaded on cameos and I would have been fine with them having no meaning.

The ending was not climactic or at all surprising. Again it felt rushed and incomplete. Also marvel fans do not stay for the two pointless end credit scenes that mean nothing and make no sense and don't get me the least bit eager or interested to see whats comes next as most marvel movies do. The second end credit scene has nothing to do with future marvel developments and is a character with no powers or significance to anything and adds nothing to the movie. In fact I heard a few people boo and one person say that sucks after watching the second end credit scene. Don't stay don't waste your time. Go to this move with low expectations and watch it for Wanda. Marvel knows no matter what or how they create a movie you will watch it because it's marvel. Being honest if marvel keeps making movies like this one I'm going to stop watching marvel movies. What I mean is jam packed action and not very good cgi fights with no plot or actual story telling just grab your money because it's marvel."
Nice movie,"I like the movie and I don't underatand the critizism. Probably are expecting more and more crossovers after the last Spider man. I was expecting more as well, but still I can say that is a good movie that runs far away from the Marvel recipe."
A 2 hour movie that I wish would've been 4 hours,"The movie was amazing. Why would I ever complain about seeing my two favorites, Wanda & Strange in action. I can't get enough of Dr. Strange & Scarlett Witch's storyline. The multiverse is limitless, I could've watched like 2 more hours of it if they would've given us 2 more hours of depth. I came in open minded and let myself be carried by the story. If I were to provide one criticism it would be this: they clearly held back with multiverse content to keep the window as wide as possible for the upcoming decade of movies. Cause I could've easily watched 2 more hours of it. The feeling of wanting more now is a short-term sacrifice for a long-term investment. Be kind, set reasonable expectations and buckle up folks. :)"
Wanda whinetoomuch,"Wanda Maximoff is the worst marvel character ever, possibly in all superheroes universes, probably even in all other universes multiverses. I just hate her and how she whines with everything she says. So this movie is horrible because we have to watch her so much. That and it's just not very good in general."
Great but ......,
Thoroughly disappointed with the discontinuity,"The director of Dr. Strange 2 openly admits he did not even watch WandaVision. That really goes to show in the movie we got. I was disappointed from quite early on in the movie once we learned who the villain of the movie is. I mean, even the trailers for this movie misrepresents what the movie is about. I have watched Daredevil and the other Marvel-Netflix series, and I was always disappointed that they were a complete waste of time as there was never any tie-in with the wider MCU other than the occasional honorable mention. With WandaVision, Loki and What If? I finally got the feeling that Disney was going to fix this disjointedness. Alas this movie clearly goes to show that those series were a complete waste of time. From the early onset the movie completely ignores what happened in WandaVision and repeats the same story over again, and does a bad job at retelling it. This time around the plot device is very shallow. It never goes beyond Wanda's basic, maternal instinct. I found myself bored in the cinema, actually, with yet another shallow Marvel story that relies too much on CGI. It basically is a bad retelling of WandaVision. Additionally, the movie does not know the story it wants to tell: The word ""multiverse"" is in the title, but the movie in actuality does little to no exploring of said multiverse. It does give us a quick snapshot of a number of dimensions, but no exploration happens. And that is a shame since actively engaging the multidimensionness as a plot device like in What If? Would have been entertaining to watch. As in, I would have liked to know if there was some large, hidden secret with the mirror dimension? Or the astral dimension? I actually expected there to be a huge tie-in with the Loki Series on Disney+, but alas instead we get a movie that tries to do too much in too little time. We get zombies, weird space starfish monsters like if it were a Suicide Squad replica. We get a disjointed story and an odd cameo from those other franchises that Disney now own. In conclusion, I am afraid that the MCU will become yet another X-Men disaster. What basically killed the X-Men as a serious franchise was the lack of cohesion between movies and its blatant disregard of continuity. Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is exactly this: A disaster of continuity for anyone having watched the Disney+ series leading up to this movie release. But at least now Marvel can just make up the cheap excuse for every continuity error that happens in future: ""The story takes place in another dimension"". And that is what this movie basically is. It's nothing but a strategic move from Disney to make more movies that do not necessarily relate to one another, because they now introduced the multiverse concept."
Exciting Darkness,"It is probably the darkest movie of MCU. However, this darkness gives audiences a courage to look for new suprises in each minute of the movie. Loved it!!!"
Horrible,"By far the worst Marvel movie. The plot was weak. I thought it was written by a bot. Then all those evil shot started happening. Demonic possessions, evil souls, horrible horrible stuff. Do not recommend on any level."
Fast Paced and Stunning Visuals,Fast paced and no unnecessary scenes. Magic from the start till the end. Nice scriptwriting. Visuals are stunning. Somewhat of a poetic ending. And Dr. Strange 🔥 One of the best movies of MCU. Much better than Spiderman NWH.
Stop making more Marvel sequels,"At what point, does it simply becomes repetitive with just a different villain and CGI in movies.

Apparently, this is the 28th movie in MCU, and probably the 20th time they used the same template for the movie.

The graphics were good, but the stunts were Duh! And the story was 'Okay whatever.

Done watching Marvel Sequels unless the Russo brothers come back to direct something."
Goofs in Pizza Restaurant,
I find myself in a bit of a conundrum,"What did I just watch? Was it what I expected, yes and no. Don't get me wrong the graphics, the acting, the movie it's excellent. So why a 6? There is so much about this movie that makes it the perfect MC movie. But parts of it felt awkward to me. I'm a big MC fan but I've never been much of a Wanda fan, I couldn't even get through the first episode of WandaVision. The bits in the movie that were off pudding for me were those ""WandaVision"" moments. Will I watch the next movie, yes indeed I will. Will I watch this movie again, most certainly. Overall this movie is a great action watch."
Boring script with a few good scenes,"Sam Raimi's directing , Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen castings saved the movie.

It's not even doctor strange movie it's scarlet witch in the multiverse of madness with a girl who can travel through multiverse."
Stupid and scary,"I love marvel movies but this has got to be by far the worst one. It seemed like they were trying to create a b-rated horror movie. As a person who hates horror, jump scares or gore I enjoyed watching marvel movies cause most of them did not include these things but this one included all and had a stupid plotline on top of it.

Sorely disappointing."
Too dark and evil for my liking.,
Over Hyping an ordinary movie.,
Stop expecting Cameos!!,
Garbage,"Another of those pointless, money-making hokums by Marvel. Tried too many things, failed in each one of them. Clueless script, lame jokes --> Clueless script, lame jokes, like an infinite loop."
"Enough Dr Strange, not enough Madness","Enough Dr Strange, not enough Madness.

Enough Dr Strange, not enough Madness Enough Dr Strange, not enough Madness Enough Dr Strange, not enough Madness."
It is horrible alright,"I really hated it. The story, make up, special effects, acting, lame cameos, overall cheesiness... It is completely horrible. Really wondering why this is not a laughing stock like morbius."
A super horror movie but A super hero movie,"Director got confused a super hero movie with a super horror movie and killed a wonderful franchise. Evil dead effect on Sam Raimi.

Keep your expectation really low and you can get over it."
Multiverse of MADNESS,"This film is very very DIFFERENT. It's so fast paced and this can be a good thing but the films pacing suffers from a poor script. The cameos feel forced in and not natural. The film could have been so much better than it actually was and therefore it's a bit disappointing. I think it evidently has Sam raimi's fingerprints all over it and whether you like that or not will be a big factor on whether you like the film. For me the film was decent but did I come out thinking WOW, unfortunately no I didn't."
Awesomeness every second of the movie,"Super awesome what a movie mindblowing i loved every second of the movie, i will definitely watch it again In theaters, the suspense was crazy, the running time of the movie was great I didn't want it tot stop, you just have to watch this great adventure of madness to believe it, don't read or believe those crazy nonsense movie critics that never seen a movie and just give nonsense reviews, if you read my review you no that that is the only truth don't even bother to watch any else there opinions."
Wait until it comes out on Disney Plus,
"Give it more length, let the movie breath.",
That's what you get when you have too much hype !,
Confusing,
Very disappointing ...,"The first film was very good and I had been awaiting this one's release with high hopes. Unfortunately, those hopes were dashed within about 15 minutes of the start. The story is pretty much non-existent and it has far too much reliance on CGI which dominates the entire film and is completely overpowering. As a result, Cumberbatch's acting talents are stifled. The supporting actors are downplayed, making the entire film more of an ordeal than a pleasure to watch. This is not a Marvel film that I could recommend, although anyone who prefers CGI to story may enjoy this more b."
Breaks out of the Marvel mold,
Lame,
Disappointing,"It's a shame how much this movie was hyped up, including the ads that gave away every shock value scene. I guess I was expecting way more from a film like this because it had soo much potential, but fell extremely short. This film was all the cheesiness from the MCU plus the creepiness and gore of Sam Raimi horror films. It honestly should've been rated R but not for good reason. Also, don't bother waiting for the SECOND after credit. It's worthless."
Nice movie but complicated,
Multiverse of madness,
Sam Raimi all over,"This is the first Marvel film that feels like an authentic product from a recognisable director. I get that obviously he must have been told to include certain things and what the endgame of the movie should be, but the road to get there feels very authentic.

I had never expected horror to be present in a Disney/Marvel product but here it is for the first time, it changes the dynamic of formula used in all Marvel films and it feels fresh, a bit restricted due to the PG-13 rating, but fresh nonetheless. Though this freedom given to Raimi may come with certain flaws, I hope more Marvel products and CBM movies in general go into this direction with fewer restrictions each time."
MCU have some lessons to learn,
"Best Sam Rami film, hands down - spoiler review",
Had expectations 😒,"Love the movie but story is weak. Also i had high expectation. Mfs on social media said tony stark would come, spider-man would be there. Wtfff dude.

But its worth the watch. I was looking for more. Hope to see something bigger next time wanda killed it. She was the best."
First comment from me ever,
Stop paying for Marvel movies,"Marvel is dead. The movie is garbage, woke garbage, it is full of identity politics. The character named ""America"" has a trans/pride flag pin on her jacket, ffs."
I miss iron man,
Could have been so much better! Multitude of meh,"I quite enjoyed the first Dr. Strange along with most of the other Marvel films.

This one to me was a huge miss.

Did you like Spider Man 3? If so you will like this movie. If not then even some of the great special effects in this won't save it. It could have been so much better but felt extremely rushed.

The main storyline with Wanda was ok, however quite obvious in the direction it ended. Olsen does a good job with her character and her screen time was probably the best of the film.

The rest of the film was poorly acted and seemed extremely disjointed (irony considering the subject). There were some really dark and suspenseful moments with even a few jumps, then some really cheesey moments that seemed right out of a pre ride show at Disney. Even the wardrobe and makeup were cheesy and almost comical.

Ten minutes into the film I found myself thinking ""Am I getting old or is this really this bad""

The cameos were fun but not enough to save this movie from itself."
overrated. overhyped. subpar.,"I was expecting more because of the trailer. Poor acting, poor script, jokes are not that funny, and comparing this to other MCU movies, this is definitely below average."
Exceeded expectations,"I saw this film in IMAX and it was brilliant. The storyline itself I thought was so cleverly thought out and the way they explained the multiverse was so good. I could fully understand what was going on, the CGI never disappoints and as always, the cast were amazing.

I very much recommend for anyone who is a fan of marvel, you will love this one also."
Felt more like Wandavision's sequel than Dr Strange's.,
I liked it but I was also disappointed... It could have been so much better,
*Spoilers* Great film but quite wEiRd...,
Raimi GENIUS? Answer: YES!,"The movie is a masterpiece! Both the visual part and the emotional part are on top. Sam Raimi is amazing with his unique style! Yes, of course there are disadvantages, such as the absolutely empty character of America Chavez, the film's running time is very small, I personally did not have enough time to enjoy all this splendor! It would be better if they cut the time for ""No Way Home"" and gave 15-20 minutes to the sequel to Doctor Strange! After all, the theme of the multiverse, and the film is so short...how is it at all???!

But I really liked it, morality can be traced and not even one! Finally, superhero movies teach something useful again! Thank you Sam Raimi for a job well done.

The music, the camera work, visual tricks from 80s horror movies, it's amazing!!! Raimi's openings, the horror elements are really energizing in places and it's very cool! The movie isn't scary, but it can still be annoying. At least something... In particular, I want to highlight how they worked on the character of the Scarlet Witch, this is without a doubt the highlight of the film.

And I will finally say, if without spoilers, but I really had TOO FEW ""all these guys""...) But the film is powerful and worthy."
"MARVEL'S TOP 5, DIFFERENT AND EPIC BUT ALSO HUMILIATED BY FANS","This movie is different and epic, with alot of hearth on it, with beautiful cinematography and camera work, with almost perfect VFX, the terror on it is very well done, Sam Raimi was the best director for the movie, marvel could pick, you never get bored, its always something happening on screen, the actors are incredibly talented on it, marvel really wrote and made this film for og and diehard fans, with easter eggs and enogh surprises wich add alot to the film, now the bad stuff, the film feels fast and cuted, with some unexplained stuff, then it feels like they wanted to arrive to end, it feels fast and hasty, then the runtime is 2hrs and 6 minutes which is not enough for the story they are telling, and that makes it feel (again) HASTY, then the most sad part, the cameos, sadly fans are evaluating the movie based on the cameos, fans are being unfair with marvel, their expectations ruined their experience and that makes them value the film by something they shouldn't, if you are going to watch it, and you want to see every cameo on the world, yust remember, this is a doctor strange and scarlet witch film, not an avengers endgame, this film is satisfied being a sequel.

The film is a love letter to REAL marvel fans.

The ones that are not going to rate the film based in the cameos, but with the thing that do matter.

SAM RAIMI DOES IT AGAIN."
Is it solo movie or an Event Movie?,
A good movie but didn't meet my expectations,It started off so well but went down hill towards the end. Even though it didn't meet my expectations this movie was still really good overall. This movie did an amazing job at the horror aspect which was my favourite thing about this movie . I'm excited for scat's next!!
Best movie of them all,Love all the other movies but seen that they can chance it up a little. That was Refreshing. This is DR. Strange movie. Of curse it need to be abit diffrent.
Multiverse of madness is a disappointment - and still not a bad movie,
Visually and Aurally jarring mess!,"Too fast-paced, too loud, too boring! For all the hype about Strange's and Wanda's powers, the battles are surprisingly prosaic from a tactical perspective; give me either of their powers and I'll show the multiverse how to defeat the baddies! :)"
Let's Face It. Steven Strange is Kinda Boring,"Visuals definitely carried here. As it should have, definitely blown away at every weird and shape shifting moment that left me with ""how did they do that?"". With that said, there's really not much riding with this movie as a stand-alone. We see some nostalgia and surprises that definitely keep this movie entertaining, but Steven Strange's arc just was boring and felt like filler. With that said, this movie in the end does generate more questions than answers, and left me excited with what's coming in the future.

I'd watch this again, but only to see how cool the visuals are... maybe that's the whole gimmick with Doctor Strange anyways."
2 hours of fun,"The movie was like a rollercoaster ride - non stop action and fun. 2 hours went by super fast . I absolutely loved the visual screenplay and the PG13 horror - something different in the MCU offering. Acting of all the main cast, visualization(CGI) and the background score were excellent. Elizabeth Olsen's performance was a stand out for me.

One can take issues with the lack of character development and the short time given to the cameos... but given that almost all the world now knows about these characters and their back story (except for America Chavez), I feel that the director did well not to dwell too much into these.

The only thing that bothered me mildly were the convenient plot holes the movie takes to move the story forward. But then it is all explained by magic so why not! Just enjoy the fun-ride."
It was nice,"It was a much better movie than the first movie if your expectations were not high. Wanda was strong yes but that didn't put Stephen in the background. But before you watch the movie, please forget about the fan theories. You'll have more fun."
Disney be woke yet again,
Must Watch Movie,New Story Line with Awesome Animated..Much better than the First One. Exited for third installment. Every character has done the good job Fighting scene was Awesome. Marvel Best Animation movie.
Not enough Dr Strange. Characters introduced carry no weight.,
Good but still fall short on other things,"I do like the past movies that was made by marvel, even the other tv show. This show had some highlights and low lights i think follow the release of the Spiderman No Way Home sets the bar too high for the fans to be spoiled a lot. Dont get it wrong the movie is Gorgeous and i do like it. I think the story just tried to clarify things(about the multiverse) not really good for a standalone movie in my opinion. Overall good movie i liked the visual effects it has and the music danny offered to us still giving this movie a 8 not perfect but not bad."
Many disappointments,
Glad I went,"Nearly got put off going after reading a few of these posts . So glad I went anyway. Havnt had as much fun at a marvel movie since endgame (last spidy movie was close).

Watch wandvision and ""what if"" series first if poss."
I am confused,
THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE KEEPING IT REALLY ACCURATE TO COMICS !,"Except marvel focusing on Avengers this movie was based on Strange and Wanda, after Endgame this movie was a blow of joy to it's fans. The perfect use of horror. Perfect direction. Perfect combination of cast. These made the movie a pure success !"
"Amazing Action, horror, heartfelt & exciting movie","It's extremely hard to make a movie, exciting, heartfelt with horror action. This movie has it in spades and non stop. It has mad amount of pacing and there is constantly a great threat. Just to make sure, the threat is overwhelming level of threat, story tries to convey that over & over that threat is just too over powered for anyone to handle, and if you try to reject the idea that threat is not OP you will lose enjoyment in the movie.

It has the most deaths of any Marvel movie yet. Some people feel like the multiverse is not discovered extensively but its a movie, if too many verses are discovered there wouldn't had any focussed on any one of them. I feel like multiverse idea was handled pretty nicely without overwhelming the story with just cool shots of universes. ('What if' tries to expand on them in half hour episodes and they are not movie quality, not even good just ok stories)

This is one of the best Marvel movies, took 1 point out only because 1st act could've been expanded on a little more. It was too fast paced."
Well built and masterfully shot for a popcorn movie.,"It's tiresome the amount of pretentious garbage you read from comic book fans and movie goers that actually think Marvel will produce a film without plot holes or crazy twists and weak dialogues.

It's a popcorn blockbuster movie that's supposed to be entertaining mostly because of the grandiosity of its scenes and special fx. Nevertheless this one is interesting, although the multiverse idiocy (shared with DC) is just a load of cr*p created to milk the characters.

Watch it, enjoy! There are two great actors here, with great performances. The colors are amazing and the imagery is brilliant! Sam is a great director with great ideas. There is some humor and the film doesn't take itself too serious, like all Raimi films.

Don't care about those who give poor ratings. They actually will never know what makes a film great, much less it's plot. They probably love films only after the time renders them into cult movies. They could go write about independent author cinema if they want meaningful stories and characters. Cinema is a multiverse of languages.

Enjoy the ride. It's a good one."
Madness Indeed.,
Not the sequel Dr. Strange has deserved,
Sam Raimi and His Creation...,"Really loved this film. Some of my expectation was crash but Sam Raimi did a great job. Elezabeth olsen Nailed it... Benedict is like water, he can fit in every object. New Girl Xochiti Gomez Amazed me. And wong is always Favourite. ❤❤❤❤❤.4 out 5."
Sooo bad,Who said yes to this terrible script. It's so bad. Reminds me of season 8 of game of thrones bad.do not waste your time this movie is so full of holes the Swiss don't even want it.
Amazing Film,"I haven't been following the Marvel films, but I'm a big fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and Sam Raimi, so off I went to my favorite Las Vegas theater to check this film out. Even though I didn't know the Doctor Strange backstory, it was worth every penny. The CGI is the best I've ever seen, Danny Elfman's score is perfect, the entire cast is outstanding, and there are lots of cameos to enjoy (Bruce Campbell). Sam Raimi has always been one of my favorite directors and he really excels in this one.

I think this film really raises the bar for future superhero movies. Yes, it is that good!"
Did the Multiverse gone wrong or the Madness gone wrong? Yes the answer is Multiverse.,"❎ Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ✅ Doctor Strange in the Scarlett Witch Madness

The ""Madness"" shown in this movie was pretty good but in terms of the ""Multiverse"" didn't go very well. This movie is more likely for Wanda, the main plot is just about Wanda whose already evolved into Scarlett Witch trying to achieve her needs by using the Multiverse and how Dr. Strange needs to solve her problem. This movie lacks the journey of Dr. Strange exploring the Multiverse and mainly focusing on Wanda causing madness with her overpower character."
One of the worst Marvel films,
I gave it a 3 only for the great VFX,
So here's the problem with this movie,
Bottom Tier Marvel Movie!!!!!,"Too much horror / Harry Potter and not enough multiverse. They call the movie the Multiverse of Madness, but the only madness is the plot. True Mark fans will dislike this."
"Crazy, magic, madness","What's great: Incredible imaginative effects that are mind boggling and befuddling in their execution. So cool if you are a fan of fantasy and magic like I am.

Benedict cumberbatch and Ben Wong are so awesome together. They seem to enjoy each other's company and that comes across on screen.

A far out story that is somehow pulled off even though it stretches the audience belief in its credibility to breaking point.

Non- stop action with almost no rest-bite. Beautiful character and set designs and effects. Thrilling action and camera work.

What's not so great: Elizabeth Olsen shows is a bit of a one dimensional actor and her sudden turn to the dark side seems not fully explored and seeded here. For me it almost undoes the film.

Also the story almost pushes the viewer over the edge in terms of its unreality and its plot and concepts are almost a bit to spaced out to carry the film.

Verdict What holds things together are the two male leads acting and the shear pace of the action. Benedict Cumberland can carry this and ground it when necessary. After the disappointment of Eternals and the recycled Spider-Man concept release this was a a LOT of fun."
BEST SUPERHERO movie,ALL'S DONE GOOD LIKE THERE ACTING AND PLOT ARE ALSO GOOD AND GFX ARE TOO GOOD OVERALL 9/10 And specially wanda 😭 I love her her after this her acting skill are too good Benedict is also good but Elizabeth nailed it.
Average movie,Just an average Marvel movie. Not even close to Spiderman no way home. The 1st part of Doctor Strange was far better than this one. Hype is not real. No Avenger appear in the movie from this earth except of Doctor Strange and Wanda.
Manage your expectations,"I would say that movie feels smaller in scale than you would expect. It feels just like another episode and not a game changer. It's more Wanda vs Dr. Strange movie rather then big multiverse-multistory multi phase 4 movie.

Cameos were cool, wish we'd seen more. Movie like this is opportunity to go bonkers crazy.

Manage your expectations. It's fun and solid movie, just not as big as you would think.

Honestly, the first movie is one of my MCU favourites, and I liked it better then sequel."
Hits and misses,"Plot was chaotic and confusing, and the writing was quite campy. Lots of time spent showing random character's deaths very graphically, without actually advancing the plot or providing character growth/development. Highly disappointed because this could have amazing as the themes and moral decisions were very deep and profound, but it was heavily overshadowed by the gigantic plot holes and awkward exposition. Expected way more."
Only watched the series because of Rachel McAdams,"Watched the series because Rachel McAdams was in it. Broke my heart that the lovely couple didn't go well. Can't say the plot was interesting to watch, most of the time just a crazy woman acting crazily."
More over the top but entertaining,
"The movies was good BUT,",
No Plot,"The special effects and action scenes were great. The horror aspects were very good. However, the plot was non existent and the script/acting was at times cringy. Overall rating is a 6.7."
The most Unique kind of Movie ever created in MCU,
"Plot is up to personal opinion, technicaly it was not good in 4DX","It might have been the technical presentation in IMAX 4DX of this particulair cinema but compared to the previous movie this was a let down. The 3D effects seemed very poor fabricated, too much blur and the sound was like an old television set.

It realy made me wonder if my memory of the previous movie was accurate as I've seen it twice: First in cinema 3D with DTS sound, after at a friends place on a huge Sony with 3D presentation and Dolby 7.1 soundbar.

Both times were a visual treat with excelent sound. This one felt like it was produced for TV instead of cinema.

Concerning the story nothing spectaculair, good or bad. Just bland and the Disney inclusivity touch in the form of America's 2 mothers.

The absolute highlight was the music battle! Misplaced in a Marvel movie but still very well done."
Wanda<3,"Wanda is mother Slay.

No but actually, I love the way sam directed this! It was always interesting and fun to look at even if it was scary or trippy or just plain beautiful. I think it was the perfect direction for sutch a high magic setting.

But also I love Wanda regardless, even when she's doing questionable things I will support it for the sake of her story."
Very entertaining visually and excellent storyline,
I need those 2 hours of my life back,"What a bore this film was.

I loved the first Strange film but what the hell was this?

Two hours of people yapping in a sub soap opera plot. With goals and desires that were not even clear.

After 2 hours I still don't know what any of the major characters even wanted or were desiring to do.

Went to see it at the cinema because I thought it would be a visual feast at least like this first one but no. All the special effects are in the trailers.

Other than that its just people standing around and talking with clunky dialogue and no plot.

What a waste of 2 hours."
SAD,"Opening they Copied ""The Mule"" and went on to copy many others good movie scenes like Disney is know to do.................................................."
FANTASTIC HORROR SUPERHERO BLEND,"THIS MOVIE WAS PERFECT HOLY- The acting, plot, and vfx is mind-blowing, everything you want in a doctor strange film. Elizabeth olsen and Benedict cumberbatch, give them an Oscar already, their acting is something I've been waiting and wanting to see in films nowadays. I got chills every now and then. Sam raimi you really are the goat!"
Good movie. Definitely deserves better. Marvel Team just messed up.,"I know Strange's fans were robbed, I really don't understand why they gave him kinda weak role in his own film, but at the same time I'm glad they showed us how powerful Wanda is. I have no questions for Sam Raimi and for the whole cast. They all did a brilliant job. The effects are really good and scary. They made Wanda so bossy and literally terrifying and I really liked it. America Chavez is a cute kid. I liked her too.

And I feel really bad for this movie because it's definitely not bad. I see a lot of 3-6/10 ratings and it's not Sam's or the cast's mistake. Really. As I said earlier they did a very brilliant job. It's Marvel's Team just messed up with the name and with the scale. It's like something wasn't enough for me. I mean, there just a lot of things: the multiverse stuff, the new character, Wanda as a villain and don't forget it's a Strange's solo movie. I wanna say that it's really hard to fit all of these things for 2 hours. And Marvel really didn't give full freedom to Sam.

So, movie is really not bad as itself. Sam's gave us really good horror and dark vibes. I'm on my knees because of Wanda, Elizabeth is really such a good actress, same as Benedict 1 and 2, Rachel and Xochitl. Big thanks to them all. Love them. All claims about the name, the scale, the plot should go to the Marvel Team literally, because actors and their characters have no influence in this kind of stuff. No, I'm really feel bad for this movie. He deserves better."
"More madness, less multiversal","There was surely a lot of madness. The action sequences and visual effects are breathtaking. However, you don't get much of a taste of multiverse. It still lies in the realm of the ongoing MCU universe, with a hint of multiverse and does not hint at how it will connect with upcoming marvel movies. Overall, worth watching."
This movie doesn't know what it is.,"Disappointing. The few epic and horror scenes do not go well with the cringy moments and CGI worse than the previous film. Every moment of ""wow"" is countered with a moment of ""bleh"". Good idea at its core, poor execution. Every scene and act has a different feel, leaving the viewer unsatisfied. Also, this movie wrecks the power hierarchy you thought you knew in the MCU, and not in a good way."
So many haters !,"People writing I didn't expect this meh Wtf bro . Thats the point , movie will be not what u expect it's weird and strange in a good manner Some will dislike it and some will like it . It's not a typical Marvel film it's different. U don't understand story because u haven't watched Wanda vision . There are so many Marvel haters right here It's a good movie , very good It's has some flaws like it feels like rushed , it needed some more time . Overall a excellent movie from CGI to acting everything."
Dark and Crazy,"I really like this movie. How Sam Raimi's hands completed this film with its distinctive feel of horror. I enjoyed the story, where Doctor Strange is a very responsible person. But some characters seem wasted here because of their short roles (sorry if this contains spoilers). Overall I love it and can't wait for Doctor Strange's next adventure!"
"a small step for man, a giant leap of Marvel","A nice first step of horror films for Marvel. We can see Marvel 's been trying to bring more into the genra and surprise the audience. The movie is full of imagination, though a bit pity that the pace coule have been more slow.

Many say that the plot is paradoxical, as Wanda Vision came out earlier. Actually this movie was shot earlier than Wanda Vision and should have been released earlier, too. The COVID messed up most of Marval's plans(for which reason Raimi didn't communicate with the director of Wanda Vision enough, and Elisabeth Orson even shot the two works at the same time). So to those who haven't seen it so far, you might wanna change the order you watch them."
I want my money back!,"From beginning to end, it was pandering, virtul signaling and stupid! I knew it was going to be a little crappy but this was ridiculous. I went to see it because Dr. Strange was my brother's favorite comic book character. I went in honor of him. It was a total let down. America Chavez is such an insignificant character in the Marvel comics, it's just stupid to have her the center of such a huge story. Thank goodness for Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlett Witch or this movie would have been a total dumpster fire. Wong is the Sorcerer supreme? WHAT? NO!! No! NoNO!!!! Stop with this ridiculous virtue signaling! It just completely ruined most of the movie."
Don't bother,"Don't waste your 2 and half hours. Go on a blind date! Total pants movie! Nonsensical, all about Wanda! Should've been called ' I Wanda why I bothered watching!'"
DARK AND FILLED WITH MADNESS!!!!!!,"AMAZING, JUST LOVED THE HORROR THEME OF THE MOVIE I WAS THRILLED IN EACH AND EVERY MOMENT OF THE MOVIE THIS MOVIE IS A TREAT TO US MARVEL FANS I WOULD LOVE IT MORE IF IT WAS A BIT LONGER I THINK WE SHOULD ASK FOR SAM RAIMICUT BECAUSE 2 HOUR AND 6 MINUTES FELT A LITTLE TOO SHORT TO JUSTIFY ALL THE CHAOS GOING U[P IN THE MOVIE."
WHERE IS BLU RAY 3D VERSION,"Damn Dysney, this movie is awesome and on 3D is more more more awesome than fu**ing 2D...

Why people is so stupid and useful, my god

................................................................................................................................................................................."
good movie,"The jokes in serious scenes ruined it for me, but that's Marvel i guess. Overall i like to see where Marvel is going with the Multiverse, should be something to look up for."
A welcome change of pace in the MCU,"The multiverse of madness brings an off-the-wall change of pace when compared to the normal formula of other superhero movies. Sam Raimi's directing is on full display, with horror elements from his Evil Dead days.

I will say that this movie is more dark (demonic figures and references) and gory, so if that is something that may bother you or your family, keep that in mind.

This is getting more negative reviews than other movies, and it's cause they center around one character being a lesbian. Just control-F on the 1-star reviews and type ""inclusive"" or ""politically"" and you'll see what I mean. This was an enjoyable movie in the MCU due to the plot and on-the-screen effects. If something that small bothers you enough, please continue to cry more."
IGNORE THE BAD REVIEWS,In no way was this film bad! Do not let anyone put you off this by telling you there's not enough multiverse or too much this or that. Fantastic film and perfectly sets up the next Dr strange.
One of the best mcu movies,"The acting in this movie was phenomenal, the cgi was incredible. There were some emotional scenes, and I liked how there weren't too many cameos. Cannot wait to see this movie again. Elizabeth Olsen's portrayal of the scarlet witch was amazing, and the introduction of America Chavez was good."
Not worth watching.,"The script absolutely sucks. The exposition, which there is a lot of, is not as bad as I've seen in other movies. I didn't like the movie I was expecting it to be better."
Not family friendly,
Don't read the reviews ...,"I don't know why many people writing negative reviews, probably they are haters of Marvel, the movie is good, maybe not as expected, but I liked it and will watch it again."
They did a nasty one to Wanda's character evolution,
Ooooo,
Dissapointing execution of a promising story,
"Confusing, with a dash of Disney WOKENESS",
The MCU is done!,"This latest phase of the MCU has been garbage, such a sad way for the universe to die. Not one of these movies or TV shows is a patch on previous movies. They could have called Moonknight anything or anyone else that was barely in it. As for Doctor Strange 2, what have I just watched? Wandavision was a terrible way to kick things off, terrible show, but to then connect it to this movie and take this down with it, is a crime. It feels like the whole universe is just floating out of control with a loose connective tissue. Previous films stood alone and had a connectivity, I also cared for the heroes, this group I have no connection to at all, all very unlikeable. Things are all over the place the TV shows and Movies aren't working for me, there doesn't feel like a big bad around the corner and if there is, when do we expect them to turn up. Stranges big bad, doesn't feel right at all, I just hated them and wanted them out of the way asap. This was my last MCU viewing, I'm bored."
If you can't be solely entertained by CGI for 2 hours then you will not enjoy this film,"It really is just a nonsense fest from the get go. About 20 minutes in I thought to myself hmm surely it can't be this stupid and off the walls for the entire film. And yet it was, it does start to centre more around Scarlet Witch, but if like me you didn't watch Wandavision then that really seems just as out of nowhere as everything else. By the end of the film I wished I had not finished watching it as it just felt like a huge waste of time and really just ruined the Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch characters for me in the MCU.

It was barely a film to be honest, more of a mash of Doctor Strange and Wanda based mini-films with mostly cool CGI (still some really bad CGI too) and no coherent story or direction."
WOW!,"I think this movie is great especially for the cameos and for the mitic Sam Raimi, he managed to create the perfect balance between horror and superhero movies. Too bad for the plot that is sometimes poorly developed, however for the emotions it gave me I give it 10."
Multiverse of MADNESS?...,"More like Multiverse of SADNESS!!!

This movie is great for if you need to go to the bathroom to throw up all over. I fell asleep several times watching this the effects are horrible and why was he dead? Also eye gore?! GROSS WTF DISNEY!!! This isn't what Walt Disney wanted. Please take it down from Disney+ or I will cancel! >:("
"Bad acting+direction, plot with no point",
One should watch it,"Do not wait for the film on DVD or TV. This is a film for the cinemas only.

It is like a colourful firework. And it is great.

The actors have not so much acting.

The story is not important and quickly forgotten.

The most important is, that it has an end for room of the next one."
Better than expected,
Losing its grip on reality,"So Im not a Comic-Con guy but I do love marvel movies and particularly the first phase, which felt more grounded in reality. Ok there are heroes with superpowers but they existed in a frame of reference that we understood - earth! Even the first Guardians linked back to Earth via Peter Quill (plus that film was awesome as the character chemistry just worked!) with the latest Doctor Strange, unfortunately we are now off into a different dimension every 5 minutes, with virtually no time for world building and just a series of fan-pleasing cameos and unexplored plot twists. There is one big scene in the movie where half a dozen major characters are introduced and then taken out in the space of literally 20 minutes. There is no emotional connection to the loss and it sort of just passes you by.

The film isn't all bad - effects are incredible and the new America character is quite cool. Cumberbatch is immensely watchable as ever and Benedict Wong is given much more airtime which is only a good thing!

My worry is with this film, Shang Chi, Wandavision and Loki that Marvel have opened Pandora's box and can't now go back - the multiverse is here to stay and the threats are just going to get bigger, more intergalactic and fantasy based. I'm sure this is great for the diehard comic fans but for the more casual fans like me it's a bit of a turn-off.

This is the first Marvel movie we didn't watch at the cinema and unfortunately, looks like the first of many..."
Expect disappointment so you never get disappointed,"The movie is a roller coaster, from the second it starts till the last scene, all action packed and full of twists and suspense. The rumors went crazy and made the expectations sky high, but still the movie is fun and really entertaining to watch. Definitely a marvel masterpiece."
Elizabeth Olsen was impeccable!!!,"Didn't give a 10 only because the pacing was a bit wonky but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. If your not familiar with the MCU, you may not enjoy it as much. They certainly packed ALOT into this movie but when you catch all the references and recognize all the cameos it's a fun ride!

Elizabeth Olsen's performance blewwwww me away. I honestly had been underestimating her I guess. She had the best performance hands down. Great movie and a must see."
Not upto expectations! Still enjoyable..,"Definitely a spoiler free! Not upto marks but yeah definitely say a good enjoyable spin off.

Elizabeth olsen as wanda still the show,outstanding,amazing,mindblowing, Benedict cumberbatch aka dr.strange 😍 Drastically seems like fast paced, hurry on plot Still Manage to keep you engaged on seats Through out as don't expect much just enjoy the ride of multiverse.."
The downhill trend at Marvel continues,
"Cinematography was amazing, but the script was not it.",
I want More,The movie is genius. Many beautiful women. It appears Elizabeth Olsen is a brilliant actress. Not a horror but it was definitely thrilling. Can't wait to see what's coming next.
Not your average Marvel movie.,"For anyone complaining about this movie and thinks it's the worst Marvel movie, would you rather prefer the more formulaic and generic approach? The direction and flair of Raimi sets this apart from a standard super-hero movie, and I believe will fair well on repeated viewings."
Incredible,
some cringe scenes,"I was never a real fan of the Marvel universe but I admit that the style of is not bad to see. So I had to watch the film at the cinema with my family and it was a real nightmare: a mixture of horror and fantasy that doesn't work, what happens has cringe scenes, rotten humor, the film is super long and I I'm not a fan of the actors at all. The only good point is the fantastic style of the film."
Surprised People are Rating this so High,"Went into this movie experience expecting this to set a new bar for Marvel. I should've remembered that Sam Rami directed it. Beginning to end the movie struggled to find identity from the soundtrack to Wanda/ Scarlett Witch trying to refugee out her accent to all the bad exposition. The ""WandaVision"" tv show tie in made the story feel weak, it never really felt like an epic Marvel movie & all the new ""character introductions"" felt cheap & like a desperate attempt to replicate ""Spiderman."" Sam Rami desperately tried to make this a zombie movie & fell very very short. I feel bad for all the accomplished cast in this movie. They've made huge strides to find their spots in the Marvel Universe & this movie has almost taken them back to the beginning. Probably a ""must-see"" for the Universe to work but don't get your hopes up. Let's hope some new fun hot shot director comes for the next movie to try & save the story line."
Madness of Shortness,"This movie feels like a rollercoaster that abruplty ends halfway through.

First , Raimi's style has been nerfed to the ground by that PG13 requirement which caused the movie the feel like a children's horror play.

Secondly, the script didn't help, the story feels like it was re-written lots of times, and Scarlett Witch's powers have sorpassed any bounds and limit , without any good explanation.

Third and last, the score by Danny Elfman was superb, as it was the photography of the pictures, the acting was a mix of excellent performances (Ms. Olsen) and dull (Ms. Chavez, Illuminati).

This movie was supposed to launch the Phase 4 into madness and horror, or at least towards great shores of new themes and vibes, but instead it has probably killed it."
Average Marvel Film,Definitely not worth the HYPE . It became boring in middle. They didn't take any creative risk. Usual Marvel formula. With multiverse they could play a lot with stuffs but nope they didn't.
New old acquaintances,"In general terms, explaining to you why this production line is rubbish is a thankless task. I won't sound credible to crowds of teenagers, and they'll snicker at me anyway.e anyway. My dear readers, I am going to share with you what this film is about, so you may wonder whether it is worth watching again. It is unfortunate, however, that the box office agrees."
"Average, and a bit lackluster, Rather disappointing",
This is Doctor Strange MOM,
Dr. Strange in MoM,"I loved the horror vibes, coloring and cinematography! Casting was good and everyone played their roles very well. I wish it had more multiverses and more ""mindfu*king"" thing, so that's why I have to give 9/10. Dr. Strange in MoM is an awesome movie and you really should watch it!"
Average movie,This is not drstrange movie sequel this is wanda solo movie. Movie is average my rating is 5/10. Thanks marvel tv spot showing everything. No excitement you know who gona come and what's gona happen next.
Movie felt like a SNL parody!,"Bad writing! Funny dialogue felt forced!

Great directing!

Good cinematography, but sometimes it just felt awkward and weird. Can't explain it. Felt forced, bit chaotic.

Overall: 6/10."
What the Hell was that?,"Raimi lost his touch. I really hope he doesn't direct Spiderman 4 after Spdisappointment. And this one. Too much high expectations with little of the multiverse. And who cast America chavez, I'm Hispanic and I support my heritage but that girls acting was just terrible. The plot was all over the place. If you are going to invest millions of dollars you would think they would've hire an experience and well known writer but no they got someone with 6 writing credit under his belt. Plain dissappointment."
Certainly not a 12+ movie! Should be rated 15,"Overall good movie, but my daughter ended up quite traumatised after seeing everything... and she's seen Deadpool! I would early say that it's 15+ movie.

Quite interesting story, but confusing ending :)"
The Multiverse of Campiness,"It's simple. If you like Sam Raimi's campiness and early 2000s movie making style. This will really work for you. If not. This will be a cringe fest for you.

The movie definitely puts a emphasis on what most considers fun. The movie contains horror elements. But it's mixed with a bit of goofiness that Raimi fans appreciate more than myself. There are literally random moments where the sorcerers battle with music for no apparent reason other than to be a visual and audio spectacle. Also there are characters that choose not to use their powers just to set up a jump scare.

Also if you're a fan of not too serious dialogue. Which primarily serves for expositional purposes,wacky humor and overt communication. This will work. If you're expecting thought provoking dialogue that compliments the actors performances well that'll lead to some type of introspection . You'll be disappointed.

I wasn't a fan of how a good amount of popular characters are utilized just to serve the purpose to show how powerful the antagonist is. Especially when there is no attempt to build any type of connection with the characters prior. So your level emotional investment is absent.

To conclude. It's a good visual and audio spectacle that further alongs the overarching MCU plot that most will enjoy. If you're expecting something like No Way Home or thought provoking. You'll think this movie is meh."
Did not met the expectation as per the hype created,"Not as expected. Expected more from such a powerful characters and well known director with such a story where they can explore endless possibilities.

Story timeline not used properly."
"Fresh ideas with weak plot, still appreciated","I appreciate much what Sam Raimi brought his style to refresh almost-all-the same Marvel/Disney tone. Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen both brought their character charisma into top level. With stunning visual effects and beautiful production design, It's funny and enjoyable.

However you cannot ignore these plot holes, scripts is not continuous between Marvel movies and TV series, seems they are planing the big picture all at once. Eventually this sequence is just a story in a much smaller scale and much more conventional than it should be. ""Multiverse of Madness"" is not fitting its title, I believe it will be huge disappointment to lot of fans."
Fell asleep.,You can skip the first 1 hour and 40 minutes. It was boring and underwhelming. Last 20 minutes were great though. Emotional and action packed. Don't go into this movie expecting anything more. You'll be disappointed.
Expected more...,
A middle movie of Marvel,"If you don't have seen WandaVision and What if series this movie won't explain the storyline more than the title gives you!

Visually, and sound what's good overall but in my opinion the should have gone more on the dr strange version in the what if series. :)"
Great movie,"I loved the movie and all the possibilities that it opened up for future MCU movies. It did feel a but rushed in the beginning but then it corrected course.

Cannot wait to see what is next on the list."
The best any Marvel fan could ever ask for,The visuals and the story is wonderful and at par with any Marvel movie. Little deviated from the usual Marvel way of making movies nevertheless neat. Had a fulfilling experience in the theatres. Every frame is a master piece in itself. Wanda made a tremendous performance.
Honestly boring,"Nothing out of this world, especially coming off spider man, this was a lil slow and rushed in the end. But it's still a good watch nonetheless. Just nothing memorable and forgettable."
Disappointed,
Comedy at it's best,"I couldn't see this movie as anything but somekind of a spoof comedy, it's terrible from story to plot to even graphics, one of the worst movies in general and definitely the worst in MCU, Although they have a lot of that in their drawers. A total waste of time."
Possibly the worst MCU movie so far,"So bad i had to skip most of it, just no plot, no story, awful stuff, o connection to what if, or Loki, which felt with mutiverse better.... Why was this even made? Don't waste your time."
A Sam Raimi cheese-fest with an MCU setting and budget.,
"Funny, complexed, and characterous !","This newest part of the doctor strange world succeeded in delivering the most dark theme marvel movie so far due to its evilish aspect of some characters (which may shock the audience). Despite its dark theme, marvel kept entertaining us by delivering between scenes jokes that were really amusing !

At last, the plot was complex but strong which gave the multiverse a good depiction (I was cautious that depicting such idea woul mix things up in the wrong way).

The question is: will the next marvel phase movies be centered around the multiverse idea, or we may see again frequent standard non worlds mixing movies ?"
A hollow script with amazing directions,"The excellent horror touch from director Sam Raimi was a big saving point from a pretty mid plot-driven script. The script was filled with pointless fan services, hollow McGuffin and Red Herring. Going through this 2 hours movie felt so much longer than it should. Most characters weren't get any development, the only one that got it was the antagonist but felt rushed. Marvel is making the mistake of building a hollow multi-universe and forgetting the characters inhabit it. The movie felt more like teaser for the universe expansion than a sequel for a character."
This blows the entire multiverse wide open,"Here's the thing with Multiverses. They allow for endless possibilities. Marvel has blown everything wide open, There's literally endless options and avenues that they can take now. And since we know what major threat is now waiting in the wings, rest assured Marvel is just getting started. Hang on to your butts because is gonna get crazy. I can't wait. Bring on the biggest baddie in the marvel universe. Kang!!!"
Fantastic journey for marvel cinematic,"I am a doctor strange fan which waiting for since Spiderman no way home, this movie gave me different experience as multiverse present,also sam direction everything thing is top in it , but character development is underwhelm , also i appreciate g How they present a thin line story as a universal craft."
Formidable but a little Flat,
A boring mess that is occasionally fun and entertaining thanks to Sam Raimi style.,"For start the script isn't good. It rather generic and it take some times for the real madness to begin. There's stakes but you don't feel the urgency because you don't have time to care for the characters. Most of their arc felt rushed. Also there isn't much alternate universes and not enough madness which are the best parts of the movie. There's a little bit of your typical MCU humor that are hit-and-misses but some of have that Raimi touch which can be refreshing if your into his style.

It feels like two directors worked on this, the producers and Raimi. Most of the exposition scenes are uninspired and boring. You can tell that Raimi probably didnt have enough time to establish some good cinematography. At least it better than No Way Home on that part.

Raimi style is heavily diluted but when it time for action he delivers. There's some pretty good wacky and creative scenes as well as some pretty intense battles. There's some gruesome kills but without the gore. You can tell Raimi is pushing the PG-13 rating.

Most of the cast are pretty good and the special effects are good. There's on few occasion a little mix of practical and cgi effects which was refreshing in these times.

Overall it a fun mess that could've been so much better with a stronger script and more creative control to Sam Raimi."
Check it out for yourself,
Utterly broken writing on every level,"The acting was good, the CGI was passable, considering the time constraints studios are under these days, but the writing is frankly almost as god-awful as Loki. Barely anything in this film has a reason to occur, and not a single character makes it out of the film with any coherency, reasoning, or dignity intact.

They manage to break their own Original Character (please don't steal) at the end of it.

And no, it doesn't have horror in it. It has at best a few scenes that might scare a particularly twitchy 10 year old."
Fun ride with amazing 3D,"For what it was, a Marvel flick Directed by Sam Raimi, it was the funnest rollercoaster ride I could have asked for. The part with the music was a total crackup while at the same time being a gorge for the senses. The storyline was dark and intricate but never really lost itself. All in all, really well done and a freaking fun time."
Silly movie with lots of effects,"The storytelling is silly, fragmented and a bit stupid. The ending is quite predictable. I expected something more interesting. Dr. Strange wigs are just terrible as his animated 3rd eye. This project was just meant to make easy money not really focused in what fans wanted."
Not Good,
Don't let Hardcore MCU/Disney fanatics fool you... THIS MOVIE WAS AWFUL,"As someone who has been a comic book fan for as long as I could remember, you could imagine I was one of the many who we're ecstatic to see this film without keeping high expectations because that's how you get easily disappointed (even though the first film was amazing). But this was a vast wasted effort and time. The film has one of the most boring scripts I've ever witnessed, I mean the dialogue was so cheesy with the occasional hokey MCU jokes that are clearly meant for 10 year olds.. Stephen strange took a backseat to his own film. I love the female protagonists and antagonist of comic based stories , but Kevin feige is clearly entertaining something toxic in our community. The stories are becoming almost too political to the point where stories aren't even making sense. Like I said Dr. Strange was in the backseat of his own film.. I had to go home and literally flush the BS out by watching a decent comic book movie (it was the Batman by the way). The MCU hit its peak with infinity war and endgame.. if this is a sneak peak of the future of this once great brand, NO THANK YOU. Still can't believe how sloppy the movie was."
7 it's only For The Hype and It's A superhero Movie,
Head scratching madness.,"If anyone else was left in this movie, then they should have taken it.

Leaping into Dimension has become a game.

Dimension Spacelist could never do anything by showing America's power as super.

Benedict's acting as an individual Dr. Strange is splendid.

Elizabeth's Power is shown to be Over Power."
Don't listen too the critics,What a great film this was. I still don't no how it was a 12a there were so many brutal scenes in this film. I loved every minute of it. Marvel did a great job with this film. Watch this film with an open mind and you will enjoy the ride. Don't expect lots of cameos. Sit back and enjoy the film it is great fun. Doctor strange in the multiverse of madness is a great film with plenty of excitement and fun.
The Scarlet Witch in the Multiverse of Milfness,"Elizabeth Olsen is the only reason you should watch this movie, she was given a very conflicting and at times messy scripts but took it so far, it's almost unbelievable.

Some may argue that her arc in this movie is also the reversal of her arc in WandaVision and I would like to strongly disagree. She has been in isolation for 2 years, learning about her powers and at the same time getting corrupted by the Darkhold. Her demeaner in this movie is that of someone who knows everything about themselves and is confident in themselves, that is what her arc in this movie should be. She's more powerful than ever and arguably, the most powerful Avenger. Period.

Mother gave and that is the only reason this movie is staying afloat <3."
Bad camera angle,
No Spoiler.,"A real good story in a very coherent way which has been presented in a very good way by making it a complete family entertainment with emotional dawn. Which all family members can fully enjoy but provided you are at least familiar with the character of Dr. Strange and if you are familiar with the characters of the entire Marvel series then this movie will open the doors of new worlds for you but Another condition is that physics must be your favorite subject. 3

The concept of a very difficult sci-fi multiverse (all-encompassing universes - many universes free from the constraints of time) is presented in a very simple way that even a first-time viewer of the Marvel series can fully enjoy.

A complete family entertainment that you can enjoy to the fullest."
Pure greatness. Heapy they went mostly with the madness.,
Madness indeed,Multiverse of Madness wastes no time throwing you right into the movie and never lets up until the very end. Just when you think the chaos has reached its peak it finds a way to get even wilder. You are swept through multiple universes throughout while still managing to tell a cohesive story in a understandable way. Has a few enjoyable easter eggs that provide just the right amount of fan service and leaves you excited for what is still yet to come.
Sam Raimi tried his best,"I can tell you, this movie has the face of Sam Raimi, whether it's the presence of Bruce Campbell or the details of his direction, the feature manages to convey the feeling of other movies of the director.

I was very happy that it wasn't another generic movie, but it still ends up being a Marvel movie. At several points it had to go down some meaningless paths, ending up giving more importance to references and fan services than adding weight to the plot.

The script is broken, it relies heavily on the idea that when things are lost something comes along exactly to solve that problem (ex machina), this is annoying at times.

Wanda is unstable according to the script, she is very powerful at one moment and not so powerful at another. She is simply stopped by a problem that a simple human being would have. I agree that it is hard to work in the script with such a powerful character, because you can't get him in a balanced environment, for that, the movie ends up developing a trivial problem for the character.

Overall it's a fun movie and I like Sam Raimi's direction, but still the script is very problematic and if it didn't have Sam Raimi's hand, the movie would be much more forgettable.

--------------------

Doutor Estranho No Multiverso da Loucura Loucura Loucura

Posso adiantar, esse filme tem a cara do Sam Raimi, sendo ela a presença do Bruce Campbell ou os detalhes da sua direção, o longa consegue transmitir a sensação de outros filmes do diretor.

Eu fiquei muito feliz por não ser mais um filme genérico, mas ainda assim acaba sendo um filme da Marvel. Em vários momentos ele teve que ir para alguns caminhos sem sentido, acabando por dar mais importância à referências e fan services do que adicionar peso à trama.

O roteiro é quebrado, se apoia bastante na ideia que quando as coisas estão perdidas surge algo exatamente para resolver aquele problema (ex machina), isso incomoda às vezes.

A Wanda é instável de acordo com o roteiro, é muito poderosa em um momento e em outro nem tanto. Ela simplesmente é parada por um problema que um simples ser humano teria. Concordo que é difícil trabalhar no roteiro com um personagem tão poderoso, porque não se consegue colocá-lo em um ambiente equilibrado, para isso, o filme acaba desenvolvendo um problema trivial para a personagem.

De modo geral é um filme divertido e gosto da direção do Sam Raimi, mas, ainda assim o roteiro é muito problemático e se não tivesse a mão do Sam Raimi, o filme seria muito mais esquecível."
Kind of a letdown,I'm huge MCU fan and since iron man I watch every movie day one. I waited so long for this movie because dr strange is my favorite hero and the movie was so disappointing.. it felt like they need 2.5-3 hours movie in 2 hour window.
"Complete and utter garbage - could not finish, Benedict jumped the shark","The first one was great, I couldn't wait for this one but sadly, whoever wrote/created this rubbish should never be allowed near mfilm making again. No story, much woke, boring cgi, lost all my respect for Benedict Cumberbatch in this - went from one of the greats to being a tragic sell out."
Recommended only for MCU fans .,Was waiting for this so long.... finally done watching Dr strange and the multiverse.. recommended only for MCU fans... so many cameous without any logic... script is so bad that you will start feeling sleepy...😁 Main character Dr Strange have very limited screen apperance... the only good part of movie is VFX and action sequences...
No spoiler review,"Was a good movie we give it 7.9/8 out of 10. Very entertaining, the fight scenes were amazing very nicely executed.

Was wishing to see more multiverse.,Felt a bit rushed at times .

Benedict Wong was amazing , so was up coming child star Xochitl Gomez. Elizabeth Olsen and cumberbatch was born to play the role!

Regards,

Speedy Comics Team !"
Boring,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. I found the story line boring, the scarlet witch is really annoying and an idiot. Yes visually it looks good, but that doesn't make up for the bad film and the fact Disney are just rinsing everything as much as possible hoping that the visual effects make up for poor writing of both film and series. Booo Disney, booooooooooooooooooooooooooooo."
Great movie for true marvel fans,"I can understand that non marvel fans might not think it was an amazing movie, but if your a fan of the comics you pick up a lot of references and Easter eggs and will be a great movie to watch."
This movie is awesome. Ignore the hate.,"Does it have its problems? Sure. No story is perfect. And to think it will be is a mistake. It was great. A Very fun movie with Sam Ramis fingerprints all over it. All the hate is coming from the anti-Disney ""woke/broke"" crowd that can't simply enjoy life without injecting politics in everything. Old white dudes are just butt hurt because of the diversity in this. Their precious ego is crumbling because there is a character named America that is gay and Hispanic. If you are hating on this character, just admit you are a bigot and move on. There were some minor plot holes, and some disappointment with the cameos, but so what? It wasn't enough to break the movie. Its exciting, intense, dark and at times even a little scary. And it has hands down one of the best fight scenes to come out of the MCU in years."
"Ok, but I expected more!","The visuals and the acting are great.

But the story lacks character development, and while there are some emotional moments, they somehow don't fit together very well.

Some of the woke stuff and optics that remind one of the Harry Potter movies don't help either.

Sometimes, I was even bored.

All in all it was a good show, I don't feel I wasted money or time, but I hoped for more!"
Should Have Been Better,
Too much madness for the audience to handle,"Any and every Marvel fan would expect something pretty big from arguably their biggest movie of the year (I expect Love and Thunder to be a huge disappointment) but you are set up to leave the theatre unsatisfied. Although the title is Dr. Strange the film is all about Wanda and her character's journey. Gear up for some over the top graphics as the characters travel through the multiverse.

The story of the film is less interesting although one has to praise Sami Raimi for adding a bit of horror. Few sequences in the movie were unnecessary and stretched. The bar which No Way Home set for the MCU was considerably lowered by Multiverse of Madness."
Felt rushed but still good,"My favourite marvel film at this time, but there was so many characters in such little time so felt rushed. However other than that a really good film and plot and it's exciting to see where the other films will link into this now as a whole branch of films can be made from this."
I LOVE the DARK theming,"The theming of the movie is often dark with stunning visuals that made my jaw drop.

I really liked that they got straight to the point of the movie, which made the movie feel longer.

If you like a bit of creepy elements in movies with a bit of humour, you'll love this movie.

If you hate mild horror, possibly you'll be disappointed. Its very different from the first movie. The first movie felt a bit incomplete to me. This is a HUGE upgrade!

One of the best marvel movies yet!!!"
absolutely loved it,This one is a bit darker then every other marvel movie. It was very close to a horror movie but I loved it nevertheless. I adore how they went deeper on how wanda was processing and feeling after all the loss and pain. Lizzie's acting was perfect. She portrayed the grieving mom absolutely amazing. I can relate to it and identify with it. Truly amazing. One of my favorite marvel movies.
More like Scarlet Witch feat Dr. Nerfed and The Lackluster Lady,
Marvel turns to the horror side,
Awesome but incredibly flawed,
Amazing combination of action and plot.,Good combination of plot and action. The horror aspects made it a little creepy and there were some (in my opinion minor) jumpscares. The story is good to follow for someone who doesn't know everything about marvel and what happened earlier in the mcu (wandavision for example).
"A movie that everyone loves, but have complaints about",
The Scarlet Witch,
Cool scenes held back.,"Firstly, America Chavez has gotta be the worst starring performance in a marvel movie, she felt like an actor from a kid's show like the wiggles, which really shows when she's opposite performers like Cumberbatch and Olsen who elevate these movies with Shakespearean performances.

Other than that, the plot is just a vehicle for cool scenes, and which really are cool and fun. It establishes a multiverse, which automatically undercuts all its dramatic tension, because they can kill off every character I have loved across multiple movies and I don't care because it's all just alternate realities anyway. But in the alternate realities, cool action scenes and scary bad guys and powerful magic are all there and looking awesome, even if they look a bit like video game cutscenes at times.

I had fun with this because I like marvel movies, but it's not very good, and America Chavez needs to either learn to act or be written out of future movies."
MCU just makes movies confusing,
Yawn,"The good: CGI special effects

The bad: Dialog Forced diversity for the sake of diversity Uninteresting characters you don't really care about one way or the other Too much reliance on CGI Uninteresting story. This 15 year old girl has this power why? (Oh, cause the writers say so)

Guys, pay attention to the dialog in this and similar movies now a days. It's dumbed down so much it's sickening in order to appeal the lowest common denominator...example: ""Come on kid, you got this"" ""Ready?"" ""Ye"" ""Reality has collapse"" ""Ok"" ""Run"" ""Ok"" (Insert 10 minutes of CGI) Repeat dialog meant for 5year old child

Feel sorry for my wife that really wanted to watch this, she loved the first movie.

After 10 minutes and the introduction of the cringe shoehorned in diversity hire America Chavez (wow such name creativity these writers!)) she said this is not starting good.

Mind you my wife is Hispanic and even she is sick of stuff.

Anyway she fell asleep and went to bed, can't blam her.

Unfortunately(with some exceptions) you need to watch foreign movies or pre 2010 movies to get good story without forced social justice narratives.

Sad."
Awful,Loved seeing Patrick Steward and that's it'. Bad CGI. The fun as gone watching marvel TV and films. Worst film since the Hulk.. Please stop with madness.
Get even worse at the end,
NO SPOILERS,"DOCTOR STRANGE MOM IS A GOOD MOVIE, CINEMATOGRAPHY IS MAGNIFICENT, BUT IT'S REALLY DISAPPOINTED , I WAS EXPECTING MORE , AND BIGGEST PROBLEME IS THE WAY THE DEAL WITH THE CAMEOS."
Dr Strange and The Wackiness Of Sam Raimi,
A treat for Raimi fans,"I wasn't going to write a review for Multiverse of Madness, I had a good time watching it in theatres I'm a big Sam Raimi fan and I was satisfied. But then I started reading the reviews, and it pains me to say it but the marvel fandom is becoming increasingly toxic. This pains me for the last 14 years The Marvel Cinematic Universe has managed too to be a source of unity among fans of the rather inconsistent superhero genre. Phase 4 has been rather divisive among Marvel fans there have been some pretty high highs (Spider-Man No Way Home) and some pretty low lows (Falcon and the Winter Soldier), but as super hero fatigue has began to set in fans have began trashing films and shows that ultimately don't deserve it. After the ridiculously high quality of Avengers Infinity War and Endgame people have there expectations to high and don't seem to able to get over not getting exactly what they want.

Which brings to this film which sure doesn't exactly deliver the Multiverse Madness that the title promised (a title which was announced before the current creative team signed on so...) but taken on it's own merits it is an incredibly solid and delightfully entertaining movie which some may forget is the purpose of cinema to begin with, to entertain. It's so refreshing to get such a unique storyteller to give us there vision in a franchise which is almost 30 movies long, this movie allows Raimi to bring all his usual bag of tricks and gives him full freedom to just go crazy and though this takes a little while to kick in when it does it's immensely satisfying, in fact when the film moves to the more MCUy fan service stuff is the only point were the film seemed to drag. For an MCU movie this film goes a lot further than you'd expect with the horror aspects and this is were the decision to hire Raimi really pays off with some awesome horror visuals and though it doesn't even come close to matching the terror of his Evil Dead films this is not a film to bring younger children to see. The movie manages to successfully convert Wanda into a terrifying and unstoppable force (aided by a terrific performance by Olsen) without feeling forced and staying true to the character. Cumberbatch delivers perhaps his best performance as Doctor Strange yet as he imbues the character with such confidence and bravado while still feeling heroic and not at all like the man we first met in the medical room at the beginning of the first film, yet he still has lot of lessons to learn and this film manages to give him a very satisfying and important character arc as he learns that he doesn't always have to be the one holding the knife, an arc that fully leans into the benefit of see multiple different versions of this character. Overall I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone who has there expectations in check, there are a few problems her and there, the pacing feels very off and the movie could have actually benefitted from another hour but these gripes don't distract to much from the end product. I'm disappointed that people didn't seem to enjoy this film nearly as much as I did put I hope this is a lesson to fans to keep there expectations in check."
A Sam Raimi Disney film... it is what it says on the tin.,"As a long term marvel fan who was hugely influenced by the franchise in my teens & also a big Sam Raimi fan I had a strange understanding of what to expect when going into this screening. However it didn't really work for me, you had some moments that felt like they had been ripped right out of ""the evil dead"" which where fabulous. Some really dark moment in comparison to other marvel films and some of the slightly tacky but charming humour I know and love from Sam's previous work. However this was interrupted by moments that seemed they where forced in by Disney execs to make the film more family friendly and essential be what I would call ""Disney film stereotype scenes"". This broke up the flow of the film and also made it seem long winded.

I'm not personally aware of how this film was made but I would personally say that to many seats where at the table and one person should of been aloud to do what they wanted... at-least that's what it seems like happened.

Acting was fab, cinematography was solid. I would recommend watching it after a few drinks."
"Doctor Strange 2 is a frantic, fast-paced, terrifying (in Disney measure) and interesting film.","The film brings a formula and plot very different from what we see in the MCU, it's something authentic, I've seen people talking and I say even more, it's a formula film Sam Raimi yes, without him it wouldn't work.

For me one of the highest points in the movie is the ethical and human development of Doctor Strange, he had one of the best arcs in the movie, the character in his 'tradition' is totally arrogant, egocentric and everything is always his way - That's shown at the beginning of the movie itself in the other reality - but it's clear that our main timeline stranger has had a slight lesson in this, that he's the biggest threat to basically every existing universe he lives in, every version of it.

The film has its slips like any other, the CGI bothers in some scenes but nothing that will disturb your experience with the long, it's something futile and small. The script is lazy and as basic as possible, being made up of easy solutions to move the story forward.

Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange share the role of the film, but sometimes the film ends up showing more prominence to Wanda, being a time problem for the development of the main themes of the long. Wanda is shown clearly and beautifully in the film, the continuation of a character who is destructive in what she does and is emotionally unbalanced. Elizabeth's performance is something extraordinary and beautiful to behold.

The soundtrack of the movie is something extraordinary, it reacts very well with the movie, making you feel the mind and heart of the work, it makes you explode with every epic scene of the movie.

It's good entertainment and immerses you in a bold movie style for the MCU."
Am I the only one who loved the movie?,
Things didn't get out of hand,
Decent with optimism,"The visual effect are in fact spectacular, though the hole story breaks in too powerful characters such as anticipated story turns. Would say the antagonist Wanda is motivated badly."
Good to see something different in MCU,"Very entertaining with a nice touch of horror. The name (multiverse of madness) should prepare you for this roller coaster ride. No way home and now this movie, they are game changers in MCU. Nothing is same now. Loved it!"
Best marvel movie my A**,It was hyped so much that it had no other choice but to fall so low constantly jumping from one scene to another with really bad direction and cinematography also the story line is just a continuation to wanda vision it would be decent on Disney plus but it doesn't deserve to be on the big screen tbh. And (what if) handeld the multiverse part better especially the dr strange episode was really a masterpiece but that movie heck now it sucs mega A** and i can't forget the guy with the briefcase that ran past strange like 4 times..
Doesn't live up to its potential,"Pros: stunning visuals and cinematography, great performances by the actors (with one exception). An entertaining film if you go in with low expectations.

Cons: story and character arcs taken in a strange direction, horror scenes felt out of place at times and over the top. Bit of a messy plot and some things felt forced."
Meh,"Weakest of the the franchise so far.

Just not much he there..... disappointing. Cumberbatch seemed overshadowed by effects. Wanda was ok. Wong was the best, but even his performance wasn't up to usual standards."
"Doctor Strange & the Multiverse of ""Confusion""","Yah. What to say. I had high hopes for this sequel, but healthy fears based on the trailer ...and they turned out right. My score is 5/10, but because of the over the top special effects; the score can be superficially looked at as a 6/10 if you really want to stretch it or have nothing better to do. I guess it's something to watch to pass the time. For all it's special effects ...the movie's just a confusing ball of ""meh"" to me up to a point of really confusing ""OK"".

My problems with this movie are:

--> There were too many random confused unreasoned unfleshed out plot lines that I personally did not care about. At a couple of points, the movie almost looks like it's about to take some plot idea into a uniquely interesting direction, but then inexplicably drops the ball (not to give anything away, but ""the dead body"" hint hint).

--> It was more about the Scarlet Witch than Doctor Strange really, so why not just change the name of the movie accordingly. (Actually, I felt that the Scarlet Witch was the most interesting and well played character in the whole thing - as narrow as her purpose was.)

--> Important magic items are dealt with very lightly/flippantly/haphazardly.

--> Too many side superheroes show up to try to steal the show (I had no use for the whole Illuminati thing WHATSOEVER).

--> The main side character America Chavez is pointless really. The reason for her being in the the film could have been subbed out for something else. Also felt like there was zero believable character development with her, only superficial development. Weak sauce. I had no interest in her at all.

--> Doctor Strange is turned more into a Kung-Fu Superman than the uniquely deep cerebral way he should behave - and it's jarring at times. At other points, he seems pointlessly weak/feeble for no reason at all.

--> Nothing really conveyed horror or madness at all; just a complete overwhelming random strange state of confusion.

--> I felt like the movie could have been shortened by up to 30 minutes and that alone would have made it better (...and probably even more coherent).

What I liked: -->The special effects were over the top and impressive, especially on 3D IMAX."
It was ok... for a marvel movie. It was a let down,"Hear me out, since Stan Lee died the quality of marvel movies has gone down and this is NO exception. Maybe my expectations were too high but it was a let down. I found myself asking why? Why is so much going on in such a short amount of time? Why do I feel absolutely no connection to any of the characters (besides at points with Wanda). Some scenes were executed beautifully. Others were just there. I keep trying to find things I loved about that movie and honestly I can only think of three. At the end of the day though, a bad marvel movie is still a decent movie."
"Doctor Strange and the multiverse of ""meh""","If you're going to call something multiverse of ""madness"" it needs to contain madness. This movie should have been at least 30 minutes longer and had an R rating, you could see that they cut stuff out and the gore they kept should have had more to it. It was lacking a lot in both visual effects, script and character development. America stood around for half the movie then suddenly was like ""oh I can control my powers now"" and her backstory was barely explained. Wanda's motive is so stupid and how in EVERY universe did she end up with kids? It does not make sense. I did enjoy seeing Christine more but we still didn't get a lot of Wong. The visual effects were really bad in several places, especially Zombie Strange and the roof in the city. Additionally, the dialogue felt inappropriate and out of place in several spots including the ""I can do this all day"" and ""go back to hell"". I liked the Illuminati members but they made stupid character choices and their purpose was not really explained. I was expecting more cameos when they fell through the multiverse in the beginning. One scene I did really enjoy is the one with all the music notes. It was very cool to experience as someone who likes movie scores and it fit the scene very well. I felt that it was missing plot and had a lot of unexplained points, we were along for the ride and not the lore. If you're going to give me a multiverse I want to see a multiverse and I want it to look good. This movie was advertised as something that was going to be insane and gory and interesting but it was half baked and had too short a run time. I am disappointed and I really hope they do an R rated release that is visually polished, has more gore, and a better script."
Better than No Way Home: Sorry not sorry.,
Failed to see the madness but defo seen the multiverse,"Another mcu film that fails to provide what the audience needs. Good movie, but just like most of the phase 4 mcu seemed rushed. Nevertheless somthing you will enjoy and hate and love in the same time. Another hour or 2 parts would have made a huge difference...."
Phase 4 officially sucks,"Disney tags their corporate brand onto Marvel's 14 year run of bangers, succeeding in ruining everything. The insistence on tagging a 'princess' (this time a barely tolerable America Chavez character that demands sympathy without earning it) into every iteration of their acquired IP, at the expense of story, stakes and relevance means at least another 8-10 years of crap movies enough people will pretend to like until they sell off Marvel and maybe we get some decent movies again. From the all-timers Infinity Wars and Endgame comes this worthless piece of movie-by-committee hot pile of garbage. I hated almost every frame of it. The upside? Thor: Love and Thunder is no longer the worst MCU movie."
An O.K. conclusion to Wanda Vision...,"Tis' a bit cheesy... Wanda is what really makes this movie, though not as well done as Wanda Vision. Overall, it was kind of a Strange movie 😉. Weird plot, acting chemistry felt off, some effects are lacking, Strange's hair and dye job on beard are very distracting and real fake looking. It jumps right into action, then you jump around, and around, and around the entire time. Feels like your running to catch up the entire time yet you sit for two hours just feeling perplexed. I leave the movie feeling lack luster. I guess one could think it was an O. K. conclusion to Wanda Vision... Definitely worth watching to fill in the whole MCU story, though won't be itching to watch again."
NEVER HAS NONSTOP ACTION BEEN SO BORING!,
typical hollywood,She is bad kills and destoys everything then crys and she is forgiven and looked at as a hero tired of it either you are a bad guy in a movie or a good guy it seems like hollywood has a hard time having female bad people they have an excuse or reason that they bad to justify the actions.
A bit too 'Army of Darkness',This felt very Sam Remi. Which is of course good if that style is for you. But more his stylised deliver and less mainstream in approach than other Marvel films or his Spider-Man films of old.
Good but not great!,"I honestly like the movie. I had a lot of fun watching it. But, I do feel that it didn't immerse me that much in the multiverse of madness. But on a whole, I enjoyed the movie quite a lot."
Dr Strange and the hot mess of a plot,"Visually nice to look at, performances are solid but the plot let the whole thing down as it was hard to really care about anyone or what might become of them due to the utter dearth of dramatic tension. Big fight followed by more big fights and so on and so on. I guess you could argue that due to the multiverse this comes with the territory but the result was dull and lifeless."
A Very Disney Strange Film,
Great!!,"If you haven't watched Wandavision then it will be super confusing. Also if you haven't watched Marvel 'what if' there will probably be bits that you are a bit confused on too.. I thought it was great, there is horror elements, humour and great fighting sequences. I really loved it.

If you didn't like Wanda vision you probably won't love it.."
Visually spectacular chaos,"VFX and action is no doubt great, like any other MCU movie.

The movie is too short to explain it's new characters and plot, seems RUSHED.

Spiderman No Way Home did a fantastic job because the characters which appeared out of multiverse were well known and did not need much development.

Whereas this movie's multiverse is a mess because it doesn't give enough time to new characters."
Dark,"I hope this isn't the future of the MCU. I'm a huge marvel fan but this was just really dark and feels like marvel has lost the core of marvel, making family friendly superhero movies with a touch of comedy."
"Awesome Visuals, Story and an Awesome Horror Vibe","One of the Greatest Superhero Movies of all time. Yes, there are some quirks, but except for those, this movie delivers on all fronts...Beware some of the scenes might be scary for younger viewers. Marvel keeps delivering Top class movies one after the other..."
Shocked with these reviews,"This was a fantastic movie. I didn't watch Wanda Vision and it didn't matter! Wanda was always extremely powerful. Amazing story, a ton of action. I couldn't ask for more. These reviews feel like the GEICO commercials, of just complaining to complain."
Do try to keep up!,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a crazy crazy ride, but I don't think it could have been any other way. Fans will love it, casual Marvel viewers will be asking questions and franchise newbies will be totally lost!"
The legacy of Wanda is destroy. The MCU is done.,
Distracted by the woke themes,"The movie overall is certainly less of a cinematic masterpiece than its recent predecessors, but It seemed so full of 'statements' that I couldn't really pay attention. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a hater of progress. I just can't help but wonder if Disney is now in the business of adding specific themes to every single movie that comes out of their office. It's just so in your face that it's hard to not notice."
Bizarre and Disappointing,"This film isn't outright bad, and it has some strong points. However, it strongly suffers from a variety of writing issues, among other problems.

This sequel has some of the strengths that I've come to expect from an MCU movie: (mostly) great acting, stylish characters, and envelope-pushing visual effects. Dr. Strange capitalized on the last point to the fullest, given its psychedelic subject matter. Like a few of the recent MCU movies, this one also has some very strong cameos.

That's roughly where the strengths end, though. Another typical strength of MCU movies is the witty dialogue, which this largely lacks. In addition, Xochitl Gomez's wooden performance would have worked fine for some characters, but not for the wisecracking street kid that her character is treated as. (For the record, I thought that Brie Larson was fine in Captain Marvel.) Her visual theme is also extremely on-the-nose. However, the big, big problems from this movie revolve around the plot and the villain.

I think most No Way Home viewers had a pretty sensible expectation for this movie's premise: Strange cleaning up the effects of his botched, multiverse-breaching spell. It's quickly obvious that the movie isn't going there at all. The writers threw away a perfectly fine plot and made some wild jumps in both exposition and character development to conjure another one. (Perhaps the jumps made more sense for Disney+ subscribers, but the writers shouldn't rely on that.) There are secondary plot issues, too, including an obviously nonsensical MacGuffin.

The villain's motive was reasonably interesting, but their associated world-building was a mess. Their backstory contains some inexplicable, ad-hoc components that remain mysteries to even the villain themselves. Also, their non-cohesive, ever-escalating mishmash of abilities should have allowed them to instantly defeat the main heroes, as they did with other characters. This is especially disappointing since the writers tried to blend this movie with the horror genre--just as the Guardians movies are part comedy and Captain America 2 & 3 are part political thriller. It didn't work in this case, though, since Steven Strange's very clanky plot armor releases the tension. The villain's unique powers occasionally result in some very gripping moments, but other action scenes repeatedly degenerate into Dragon Ball Z-style laser duels.

Altogether, the film is probably worth a watch for niche crowds, such as die-hard Marvel viewers, occult enthusiasts, computer graphics nerds, and Cumberbatch fangirls, but I do not recommend it for a general audience. Aside from being dark and incredibly weird, it has numerous writing-related flaws that are uncharacteristic of other MCU movies and bode poorly for the future of the franchise."
Probably Marvels worst movie.,
Multiverse of Madness,
One of the best and most underrated Marvel movies...,
Amazing,Really good action and character portrayal I thought all the actors were really good too. I personally didn't realise I needed to watch WandaVision first and I hadn't so I was quite confused until I watched that - but after I watched that it was amazing.
Satisfactory but Still not,"As I have watched all almost the main prime time series of MCU movies.

I can say that what a MCU fan can expect from this movie can't be fulfill Animations and VFX of Marvel is always as top notch as before But story line is not that hit Doctor strange who suppose to be the leading character as per the title but here comes as a sidekick I did not want to give spoilers here in my review, but thats all Hope our old MCU will return as from the timeline of CIVIL WAR and Infinity War."
Great performance great direction and a good cut.,It is a doctor strange movie but scarlet witch present equally and with great impact. This movie take you a another dimension of MCU. If I say performance wise Elizabeth oslen and Benedict cumberbetch do their work perfectly and sam Riami direct this movie in a great way also this cut into a good way the cinematography and particularly the use if angle with camera is too good.#explore a different dimension of MCU.
"Dr. Strange, but more like Jack Sparrow","I have seldom given a score lower than a 9 for a Marvel movie, but I guess it was just a matter of time. Well here it is.

I am heavily biased for the superhero genre, and so I am hard to disappoint. This movie had great effects, a lot of magic, some great reveals that foretell good sequels to come, and some nice fight scenes.

On the negative side however, the logic in the storyline is flawed, and some parts are simply ridiculous - again reminding more of Pirates of the Caribbean than previous Marvel movies. This was very much Disney. The villain story is a bit weak, and makes it hard to bite. Some of the powers are far more potent here than in previous movies, which again goes to storyline flaws. Mostly however, I had been hoping for a stronger connection to the ""Loki"" and ""What if"" revelations.

I do recommend you to see it. But whereas I have watched most Marvel movies four or five times, this one will likely not be revisited."
"Brilliant, if it were not for the woke themes forced into the script",
Not what I spected!!,
I got no idea what these people want from this movie,
One of the worst from Marvel,This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever watched from Marvel. So many wasted opportunities with this movie. It had the possibility to be good and wasted the chance.
Not the Best MCU movie for sure.,
"For me , it's a outstanding movie","It's is a great movie for all the time . And Sam raimi also directed it . The theatre experience is so great i was like thinking to shout , and so many multiverse worlds has shown it is such a great and outstanding movie for all the time."
Disappointment,"I have the impression that you have no more ideas of what to film, so the entire movie was improvised. Definitely one of the worst Marvel movies. Which has been happening very often lately, more precisely since Disney took over."
"Boring , repeated idea !","Waste of money , time , felt too much sleepy ,

Graphics toooo much and Over , Marvels' productions now it will be perfect for Kids not more than that ."
The Best movie in the past two years!!,"Every moment was compelling, exciting. The plot is very tight and the special effects are stunning. Wanda´s dream was so desperate and touching, no one is just simply evil- The travelling through multiverse was lots of fun and surprises. It's the best movie in the Strange series!"
What in the strange universe did I just watch?,"How do I begin to describe the strangest fest of madness and weird non-sensical events that happened in the movie?

If you are an MCU fan, just think of it as a non MCU movie and maybe you will like it.

CGI is very very good Acting is okayish Story is meh Cameos are entertaining This movie genre is horror and comedy and Sam Raimi did justice to that.

I could not stop laughing at some weird scenes. Lol."
"Brilliant film, sequel, and an excellent darker side of the MCU!","I am only providing a short and basic review for Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness, as there are so many positive and negative reviews for the movie already, and this is my first review on IMBD.

I personally loved the sequel to Doctor Strange and can not fault it at all. From really kicking off phase 4 of the MCU with a deeper dive into the multiverse than previous MCU films and series, to giving fans a darker and more horror styled outing (thanks to the highly skilled direction of Sam Raimi) while still being fun, well written, and visually stunning, Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness has it all.

This movie is an introduction to the broader aspects of the multiverse and an introduction to critical new characters and further development of the characters that are well known and loved in the MCU, as well as a major introduction to the darker and more supernatural-themed side of the MCU. If you are looking for a fun film with a brilliant horror theme, I highly recommend watching Doctor Strange 2 and judging for yourself. Again, I absolutely loved it and have seen it three times now, and I will be seeing it again! 10 out of 10 from me! (Although Doctor Strange is my favorite MCU character, and I am also a huge horror fan, so my review would be slightly biased, haha.) Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did!"
Honest Comic fan opinion,"Ok - I'm not going to mince words.

Raimi is a horror movie dude.

He should've stuck to his genre of flicks.

Now I love Bruce Campbell, and Raimi's work - but Dr Strange 2 was a bit of a horror to watch. I don't think Raimi's ever read any of the comics at all - if he is even at fault in the final editing.

I love what Marvel is trying to achieve - and it helps explain why the X-Men weren't in Infinity Gauntlet, or Fantastic Four's non-appearance in other storylines. I love how they're trying to bring it all together in a very creative way - and their understanding and method of bringing these old 70/80s stories to digital life.

This movie goes in the opposite direction though.

Other than the brilliant visual effects and introduction of Charlize Theron at the end, it wasn't really that good.

And I'll prove it to you: You'll watch Spider-man or Avengers over and over in the next few years... This one, you'll feel ""meh - I've seen it before"" and give it a skip.

I hope the next one sticks true to Marvel."
Don't let the rating spoil it for you,"I don't know what are people wining about this movie is a masterpiece, Sam Rami does it again He is trapped in a loop of idiots who always degrade his work I accepted the same response that the Spiderman 3 got ,that movie was the pinnacle of the superhero cinema The screenplay that Rami gives you a horror genre vibe and the music is also perfectly going side by side with the scenes."
Should have been a standalone,
Fresh air in the MCU,"Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a great Sam Raimi movie with an exciting plot and stunning visuals, which significantly and wonderfully expand the concept around the marvel multiverse. Overall the movie takes itself very seriously, is full of consequences and also significantly more brutal than usual. It has many Sam Raimi typical horror elements, that bring a nice and much desired change to the MCU. Also in terms of creative ideas, Dr Strange 2 is quite impressive (definitely worth mentioning: the Dr Strange music fight)

All in all, the movie is a must for every Marvel fan and a clear recommendation for anyone with previous knowledge."
One of My Favourite Marvel Films,This is a wonderfully fun film. There are a few very memorable scenes. And the way Zombie Strange found his way into the movie is a masterclass in marketing misdirection. I thought I knew what this film might be about. I was wrong in a good way.
TRULY AMAZING ... MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS,
Doctor Strange 2 Review,
Great movie but to much horror scenes,
Beautiful with some issues.,"I loved it, but, it could be better than this in story. Everything is great, I mean this movie looks like a real world. The only thing that just a little bit bother me is i expected more than this about quality of storyline."
so disappointing,"Loved Dr Strange 1 and Wanda as a character. This movie could have been so much better, but was garbage.

It felt like it was put together by high school students, randomly clipping scenes so dialogue felt disjointed and rushed. Wanda was turned into a boring typical villain for no reason. She had so much more potential.

Big disappointment. Everything Everywhere All At Once is how you do a multiverse well."
Fun but dumb (Not Dumb Fun),"Even though the story is kind of not up the mark, I just enjoyed. The final act quite a bit.

I watched this film a couple of weeks ago and thinking back, the first emotion/ thought is of fun (yes, that is not an emotion).

The acting, visuals and more importantly Sam Remi's direction made it worth the watch. By no means is this a great movie, but it is hell a lot of fun. I loved the horror elements in particular.

Yes, it lacks some water tight writing, it has wasted characters or plot points (but that's symptomatic of the entire MCU, still, this is one of the shorter films and perhaps that's a good thing). The end credits were worth the wait too and one of them leaving Sam Remi touch.

On hindsight, the disappointment I felt after the initial viewing has waned away to a greater degree and I am left with a rather positive vibe for the film. I wonder if that's the case for the majority or not."
Easily the worst marvel movie,"Riddled with plot holes, poor scenario and lacking character development. Only giving 3 because of good visual effects. It must have been awfully embarrassing for the production crew and actors involved in this project."
"Don't expect to see a ""Multiverse"" movie but a lot of ""Madness"" in a negative way.","There are two ways to watch this movie: As a goofy horror Sam Raimi movie or as a Marvel movie. If you pick the first one, you probably going to enjoy more.

It's clear that Sam Raimi had a good time directing this movie but didn't know how to better develop the main idea.

The sequel of Doctor Strange is a waste potential, lesser funny than the most marvel movies, with a lazy villain arc redemption and full of ""fan"" service.

Unfortunately, people want to see these movies to only have the same reaction of surprise, instead of carrying about the movie plot."
"Too much mixing, to many bells & whistles, not enough development","It feels as if Marvel is trying way too hard now to mix different heroes.

I get the teaming up of Thor and Hulk, then a bit of mixing in series for b-heroes such as Falcon and Winter Soldier, but this is a bit of a hot mess.

The movie ist definitely not PG-13 anymore. I found it way to scary and brutal for a Marvel movie without an R rating. I am not at all conservative with those things normally.

The whole movie is amazing graphically - here it could have been a consistent element such as done with Spider Man Into the Spider-Verse.

Unfortunately, the movie goes from here to there, to this to that. A bit of a mess and it is heavily about Wanda.

Difficult what to make of it, so it becomes a bit of a random super hero shuffle unfortunately.3."
Crazy movie and all masonic symbols!,
Outstanding,It was a amazing Film . I really loved it . I was so so happy after watching this film . Benedict cumberbatch as dr strange is irreplaceable . I am his big big big fan 😭😭
Scarlett Witch could be such a could character,
Honestly hard to watch past the first 10 minutes,"Disney is laying it on way too thick. Maybe if you're a zoomer you can handle it, but it really is too much for a reasonable person. Anyways I hope you really don't watch this film, lots better ways to spend your evening."
"Too much, too messy but enjoyable",
Just Madness not Much exploring Multiverse,"I love this movie, because I don't really care about the Cameo, many people are arguing more cameo to the movie, and that's why they dissapointed. For me DSMOM story is refreshing and unpredictable. Wanda is the real MVP TBH this just like Scarlet witch movie.

But i expected more in the final battle like they could use Dstrange frim the ""what if"" to defeat Wanda. The final battle is just not that big and powerfull. My little dissapointment is this movie wasn't set as fully horror movie like they had planned before. It's just like any MCU movie with little taste of horror and thriller. I hate the jokes in the beggining of the movie, it just ruin the movie."
IN THE MULTIVERSE OF WHAT?,
wasted potential or maybe wasted screenwriter,"This film cannot be called bad, a lot of effort and money has been invested in it, the only thing that comes to mind is that the film is out of place.

Danny Elfman's classical music is out of place, in the style of ""Justice League"", changing to electric guitar solos in creepy moments. Out of place is a game with transitions from Sam Raimi, in the style of the ""Charmed"" intro titles. Too adult, perhaps even elderly topics and jokes are out of place, as if the target audience of the film is not teenagers, but women and a man over 65.

The unconditional decoration of the film was the game of Elizabeth Olsen, but even she could not correct the fact that the writers of the ""Multiverse"" gave up on the solo project of the actress ""WandaVision"", where her heroine had already managed to pass the path of redemption. To put it bluntly, the Scarlet Witch is needed in this film as a tool for introducing America Chavez. The situation becomes even worse from the fact that America is a character who is an idol of young people for her punchy temper, the whole movie just runs after Strange, without having a clear motivation or any thought behind her actions.

The story of Wanda succumbed to corrosion in this chapter. Unfortunately, the story is told on behalf of Stephen, suffering from unrequited love and condemnation from the outside, so we are not shown Wanda's doubts, it is not shown how the book of the damned affects her mind. We are immediately thrown into the story, where she is bad bad witch that should be stopped no matter what. Funny, how Strange being called for ""When i did it i become enemy"" in the movie.

Speaking of the book Darkhold, which is used in story as a catalyst for everything dark in Wanda, it should be mentioned that the book was owned not only by her. Both Agatha and Strange, after applying the spells of the darkhold, were in a sober mind and remained themselves. But as soon as Wanda touched the book, she immediately lost all moral foundations and turned into a mad witch. Well, i think we see this film before and we didn't like the ending.

Immediately an unexpected comparison comes to mind at first glance - the Dark Phoenix from fox studios. In both pictures, powerful red-haired girls are forced to sacrifice for the common good and suffer for their mistakes, while male characters in the person of Charles Xavier in Fox case and Stephen Strange in Marvel case are given the opportunity for redemption without any sacrifice on theirs.

If we talk about the film not so deeply, then it is a good family dramcomedy with horror elements, the target audience of which is the director himself, 62-year-old Sam Raimi. This film is riddled with issues of aging, lack of happiness in life and raising of a new generation. Surprisingly, the ""Multiverse of Madness"" turned out to be more like a 1+1 drama comedy than a witchy horror movie."
Just bad.,"They had everythng to make a good movie. The main character was so bland, the jokes so cringy, the plot so basic. And had so much errors and an awful editing."
This is Multiverse heaven,I really don't understand some of the reviews on this movie this was brilliantly entertaining from start to finish cleverly done great affects great acting Mcu thankyou for a great blockbuster Sam raimi you are so clever in your directing. Benedict Cumberbatch You are genius in your character of doctor strange loved it.
Doctor Strange Review,"First I should say that Doctor Strange is my favorite character in the MCU and I was expecting to give this a 10 but instead gave it a 7 after three viewings.

The visual effects were fantastic as expected. This was almost Halloween themed as the movie progresses, which I kind of liked at first but it is a very satanic movie which may be disturbing to many viewers. The main villian is a witch conducting witchcraft with scenes of posessions, pentograms, and sacrificial sites. I thought this was over the top satanism thrown in but it is still a good movie for entertainment. Great action dialogue throughout with many funny scenes.

I did enjoy the thriller & horror elements thrown into this movie but the satanism was over the top in many scenes."
Loved this movie,I loved this movie. It explained how the multi verse works and I loved seeing the Scarlet Witch evolve. I loved the new character America and how she evolved throughout the movie. Definitely a great watch.
Marvel is losing it!,"How can a movie about multiple dimensions, so stunning in 3D, fall so flat? Marvel is losing it. Eternals was stupid and so is Dr. Strange. Maybe this is what happens when shooting movies in COVID times??? The actors are working from home, too. The acting was so dull, the dialog didn't add anything to the story. I found myself thinking, ""did they just say that? I could come up with these lines."" Truly, I nearly walked out, and I never leave a movie."
Very enjoyable movie. Really blow me away,"I don't what other negative reviews said but it an amazing movie. The cgi, the colors, the casting,also I really like they brought some characters from the what if... Really good movie."
Not a Multiverse of Madness,
Too short,"Character in movie really deserves some screen time which was not given to them.

The hype that first half of movie creates isn't handled wisley by the second half and felt like rush there were scenes that should've been elaborated but movie fails in that aspect also."
'What do you know about the Multiverse?!',
MCU expanding its universe is genius but will leave some head scratching,
Quite A Deceptive Title,"Not much madness or multiverse. HAH, GOT EEM!

Let me get this out of the way first, I am not a fan of the MCU, I don't consider any of their movies to be good, and as far as I'm concerned Sam Raimi hasn't made anything decent since The Gift, the man is way past his prime, so my expectations were already low.

For a movie titled Multiverse of Madness, I expected more, well, madness and more traversal across universes. The only mad thing in this movie was Wanda and Elizabeth Olsen does a fine Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman impression, and she is the only reason why I didn't give it a 1/10. Seriously, Olsen is pretty great.

It would have been far more impactful if Wanda slowly went insane because of her growing delusions instead of what the filmmakers went with, basically 'an evil book made her do it', and don't give me the 'watch the show, it explains her mental state, the book just amplified her insanity' excuse, if a movie can't stand on its own, it's a bad movie.

Raimi put some of his trademark style here and there and callbacks to his previous (and better) movies, but it's all surface level and that's about all the creative freedom he was given."
Very Exciting Like a Dr Strange Comic!,"I'm going to start off by saying the only reason this isn't a 10/10 for me is cuz 🍅🛳 doesn't happen... but other than that amazing movie for if you're a true marvel fan. I see lots of reviews from very credible people saying bad things about this movie, I think you should watch for yourself and come up with your own opinions."
Full madness with great acting by Benedict and elison,Good. JFK na GL ke rha DJ d mm ch la mm us ho ya I'll Jc cl kg GL LLC ho kya BMX cm kg cm ha cm kg GL Karo ye all JBL. Is ho gai or k DH m ky GL NV GL ke.
Very well done,
WW1984s brother,"Talk about just collecting a check! It's time Marvel went for quality instead of quantity. A character we didn't know about, throw in a touch of Xmen and this still couldn't make this good."
Can barely even be considered a movie.,
The multiverse madness,"The story and how it all played out felt really silly at times and I think all the cuts/re-Shoots affected this. The Multiverse element was okay. It was visually stunning even with the wonky VFX which was more noticeable in 3D but that's basically all this movie was, just visually entertaining. It was like turning the pages of a comic book and only being astonished by the pictures. The comedy aspect was typical Marvel which we have all gotten used to.

I liked the dark, horror elements added in as compared to the other PG5 movies the MCU makes. The core character Wanda/Scarlett Witch was the MVP it showed how powerful Scarlett Witch has become. America Chavez was a decent addition and I like the look of her power set however the movie didn't get me to care about her too much."
I gave 7 start to the movie only bcoz of cgi other than that its boring,Only good thing about the movie is its cgi and nothing I don't like the story line and wanda becoming evil and introducing so many unwanted characters into the movie from verse just stupid.
Best marvel movie,
Best marvel movie by far!,"It ties in very very neatly to What If, Wandavision, and the rest of the previous marvel movies. A splash of horror in a grotesque marvel film is genius. Absolutely amazing."
Please don't listen to the nay sayers.,"While this movie was a departure for the traditional Marvel method, I do believe this was needed as I felt the movies were becoming some what formulaic. Sam Rami was the director to take the movie to a different place also I believe that Doctor strange is the movie to do it in. Without giving away too much the horror elements in the movie are well thought and fit with the overall theme of the movie. I am not going to go into the acting as the main cast and all actors we have seen before, we know that we can trust these actors to give a good performance. Which is exactly what they did. I think that vast majority of the people who did not enjoy the movie was because Sam Rami was given the creative control which meant the way the movie was put together was not what people are use to seeing from Marvel. But even if you feel that is the case please go support this movie as it will be money well spent."
Ugh Sam Raimi,"I wish Sam Raimi would stop making movies...or at least any comic book movies.

He's terrible. I was happy and excited to see this film but when I first heard Sam Raimi taking on the director role for this film I was bummed.

Now I'm like I told you so to my friends and fam. He just ruins the potential of all these movies! Ughhhh."
Good Marvel Entertainment,"In summary, it was good Marvel cinema. There were a few scenes in the film where I was struggling, and a few weird scenes where I think a producer had ""the most grandiose idea"" (this music scores fight) but it was entertaining in the end.

But please.... does this Girl really have to be called America? There will be a lot of children in the Future named that way. My eyes rolled everytime I heard her name. I thought it weird."
The best theotre experience movie,"It is the one of the best movie I experienced in theotre, and excellent character roles Must watch movie.

VFX effects are the best in the row, horror mood."
Well...that was a disappointment...,
True Madness of Multiverse,Everything was good just the violance and horror perspective was too much. But as usual Elizabeth olsed killed the performance. She proved why she is Scarlett witch in a very unusual way 🤣
Too much,
Amazing,Was waiting for this movie for months doctor strange is one of my favourite marvel movies (and characters) Wasn't disappointed at all loved how they evolved the characters and you could really feel the horror aspects which made the experience 10x more thrilling and exiting definitely one to watch my favourite marvel movie yet and I have watched all of them 10/10.
The best superheroe movie 2022 for the moment,
Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Horror,
MoM yes it is about mom,
Disappointing movie,"Total waste of Rs290. The movie was not up to the mark. I am totally disappointed with this marvel creation. I watched the whole marvel series and this was the worst movie of the whole marvel universe. Thank you for ruining my night.

HdhdndjzkxmdkdjxjkcksksjsjxjdjzjcnjdkzksjJxjsksjzbdjksnzjskskzkdjosznjxjdkskxjcjdjdjkskzjxjdkskzbjsixjdjkskznxndnxkfkkskzjxjdjzjaksjzbhrjskzm."
Story is more relatable if watched the other series,"If one watches ""Wanda vision,Loki, what if""; so the movie becomes very interesting and amazing... But if none of the above mentioned is watched .the story line feels incomplete...."
"NOT Doc Strange 2, but ""WANDA VISION 2"" with LITTLE BIT of Multiverse.",
Average movie and much less than expected,
Disappointed.... Cuz not much characters and being so short,
Sam Raimi Horror,"A Must watch movie for a Marvel fan .... New Avengers or characters introduction ... ensures the better future of MCU.

Every Character had important roles ... Whole film centered around Wanda... and she nailed it as Scarlet Witch .."
Enjoyable addition to the MCU,"You can't watch this as a stand-alone movie, it's part of the MCU and you need the background knowledge to enjoy it fully.

Considering the premise I actually expected it to be weirder than it was, which made a pleasant surprise as I thought it would be a mish mash and much harder to follow. I've watched it twice now and it's not bored me or made me want to skip bits so I take that as a good sign."
Intriguing Overall with a Blend of Horror and Excitement!,"Spoiler-free review. Raimi vibes come together with solid acting to deliver a nice blend of horror, sci-fi, fantasy with a little bit of comedy. Visual effects are spectacular with a solid storyline and character building. Some twists and turns leave audiences at the edge of their seats as well as a few surprising cameos. Marvel/Superhero fan or not, I recommend this movie for everyone (13 and up)."
The tagline is a lie but the movie is good overall,"There's lots of good parts to this movie and while I personally didn't enjoy all of them, the setup for this movie in the tagline is straight up false.

As the trailers have pointed out, America Chavez is the key to the multiverse, not Dr. Strange. Also, not everyone in that list (of people trying to block the 'threat') is on the same side.... You'll understand when you see it.

If you want some sense of what's going on, watch Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 5/6. It's like that but with slightly better writing and a similar level of action but with more horror elements. Speaking of which, the horror is bloody at times but it's not super scary for adults. I can imagine younger children very well could be terrified by some images though. Basically, if you wouldn't let your child watch Walking Dead, you shouldn't let them see this either, the blood and gore is not too dissimilar although less voluminous due to the 2 hour runtime.

Referring to cameos - they're short and not really part of the plot (this isn't No Way Home, the story is about the characters you see in the trailer minus Professor X).

I'm not one to generally notice the score/music in a movie but there is one pretty cool scene which ties the action and the music together really well. That scene was arguably one of my favourite.

Overall, there's a decent amount of action, a few cameos (there was only one cameo that I noticed that wasn't in the trailers that I actually cared about), a fair amount of horror in the movie. It's good but it's not great."
"""sure this is Madness........But""","First of all trailers teasers & t.v spots will spoil your many charming moments.

This Marvel & Sam Raimi movie so you will get all the horror & wired creepy moments with marvelous touch. Directions, Bgm and VFX are Op no doubt

Though it's a doctor strange movie but elezabeth Olsen is the real Show stealer I mean you'll thrilled by her job. Xochitl Gomez & Benedict Cumberbatch also did great. Overall performance are good .

Movie barely has big story telling it's pretty fast forward & trust me it's not that bad .

Though ending could've better than this

After all just came down your expectations about multiverse bcz the multiverse thing is only used how much it's needed for the plot .

It's good sequel which will not disappoint you."
Quite a bummer.,Quite a bummer. Was hoping for more or less the marvel DNA. But instead it was something that i realy didn't like watching. I couldn't even watch the movie because of lack of interest...
Civil War Part II,"Wanda Aka Scarlett witch carried out her work from wanda vidion series to here and our beloved Dr Strange tries to stop her. Wanda that sexy witch whose hips don't lie sorry sorry her hips always lie, trying to convince everyone but failed. As i m unsatisfied with the script because after No Way Home i expect a higher ground work and as Dr Strange jumps from one Multiverse to another we are expecting a very strong Avenger like iron man but what they showed is just like noobs playing battle grounds that die very easily."
that is amazing,"While this film has a more grim tone than its predecessors it's still a Marvel film at heart. Of course it would take Sam Raimi to find the perfect blend of comic-book-movie, horror, fantasy and slapstick. He might be working with a massive budget now, but the man stays true to his roots and sticking with what he knows pays off.

The pacing may seem disjointed or fragmented at times, but I feel that only reflects the complex nature of the multiverse within the film. Maybe it's not like other groundbreaking MCU films, but ultimately this is an entertaining feature and tom cruse is great in this movie."
Not bad as the reviews but better...,"Well by the views I just got disheartened that the movie is a flop or not meeting the expectations. But indeed it's the complete opposite.

The whole plot is just extraordinary. I can bet that the majority of watchers didn't watched wanda Vision. So, they won't come to know what's happening in the movie... Why Wanda is so dead ass.

I suggest if you watch doctor strange watch wanda Vision."
This is Wanda Vision not Dr. Strange,This movie is not bad But im disappointed with the story Wanda vision is main characther in the movie not dr strange I think marvel wrong about the movie title.
A Witchcraft horror movie,"Do NOT go see Dr. Strange #2!!!!!!!!!!!

I went to see it tonight with my mom thinking it would be weirdly strange and super heroish like the first Dr. Strange. I was WRONG.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. I would NEVER let your children watch it. It is full, not just of magic like the other one, but of straight up witchcraft, demonic oppression, demon possession, walking dead, lost souls, demon creatures, mind control, satanic symbols and more. It was a horrer movie with some cool action at the beginning. I was mortified.

I had brought a Jean jacket in case I got cold at the movies and I had it over my face in fear 3-4 times. A grown adult. Having a jacket over their face should tell you something. I literally felt demonic oppression and my mom did as well. I prayed with my eyes closed in the middle of a marvel movie! Prayed hard. More than once. That God protect my mind... and the minds of those being forced to view this atrocity. Please don't let children or teens watch this. As a Christian run far far away...

I love marvel movies and I know some fake magic can be harmless. I'm not extreme on things. But let me tell you... Marvel Marvel Studios this is NOT ok or acceptable. I will never see another one of your movies if you make another like this. Never.

NBC wrote an article about the movie which I have included below. I found it after we got home. This is a quote from NBC...

""Oh, and it's a zombie movie. In fact, to call it a superhero movie at all would be a misnomer. It is a horror film that happens to star superhero characters. There is no saving the world, there's barely any superpowers. Other than Chavez, it's all witchcraft and wizardry.""

It would not allow me to attach the url.

Mengecewakan,
Strange reigns supreme,Most excellent film and one i plan to see numerous times. Cast was exceptionional. Action was fun and story essy to follow. Hope it is so successful at the box office.
"I didn't like this movie, LOVED it!!!",
A Trippy Horror Movie,Pizza Poppa for the win! You could definitely tell this was a Sam Raimi movie. A horror movie amidst an acid trip. It's one of the more interesting Marvel movies.
Disney is corrupting Marvel,"I would have never gone to see Dr. Strange if I'd known what was in the movie.

Corrupted & twisted view of motherhood. R rated gore and violence. Disrespect for marraige and young main character has two moms."
Multiverse Of Madness is just awesome,"Hello MCU fans,don't expect too much in cameos matter,it just a awesome film and fun to watch. Some of the horror scenes give me chills.

Positive:Cgi and Visuals were awesome. Screenplay was dope.

Negative:No too many cameos so don't expect too much. Story was ok.but the cameos matter only dissatisfied.

Worth to watch in 3D Imax."
2 hour chase scene - Fantastic Visuals,
Doctor Strange and the Dirge of the MCU,"When this first released, the critics did a good job of summing up the story's shortcomings, as well as the disappointing misuse of the Illuminati. I waited until this hit Disney+ to avoid paying to see it for those reasons, & I still feel ripped off for spending my time on it.

America Chavez is nothing more than a human McGuffin here, added in to check off the inclusion box. Wanda's becoming the Murder Witch & why is so full of plot holes, it comes across as though America wasn't even part of the initial story pitch, just shoehorned in. The trivia states that the ending wasn't even finalized until midway through filming, & it shows."
Awesome Movie But........Read my review below!,"A honest review you can TRUST!!!! Dr. Strange 2 and the Multiverse of Madness is an awesome movie and that's if you have watched in these in this order: WANDAVISION, LOKI, What If (tv series) and then Spiderman No Way Home (movie). If you haven't seen all of these, you might as well save your money because you will be BEYOND CONFUSED!!!"
Off the rails,
"Why Sam, Oh Why?","Sam Raimi is a genius. He should have known better and he should have avoided this mess at all costs. Sadly, he didn't and it will forever tarnish his silver screen magic."
One Of The Best Mcu Movies,"It Was So Good. The Humor,Horror,Action Is All Really Good A Movie You Should Deffinetly Watch And I Would Reccomnd Watcing In Imax 3d or 3d For The Best Experience."
Everything and the kitchen sink,"In a word bonkers. Beautiful to watch but this latest offering from Marvel Studios depends entirely on previous instalments of the Marvel multiverse. While that might work for the die-hard fan, Dr Strange 2 isn't a patch on the first which elegantly blended character building, a strong storyline and brilliant action sequences. Here we are treated to the latter at the expense of a convincing back story and simply nothing new about well worn characters. I am afraid this is offering is lost in the Multiverse. Wait to stream it."
Loved it,"Opens with a huge punch and keeps up pace throughout. Great story. Amazing fan service bringing in wandavision, what if and even loki plot points, if only subtle.

The raimi touches are bold - as a fan of his film style I was worried it would be watered down but definitely not.

Loads of questions answers and new questions raised as to where the story and the characters are heading next.

Funny, dark, dramatic, exciting, raimi, strange! Exactly what I hoped for! Can't wait to see again."
what,
doctor strange 2 review SPOILER ALERT,
Marvel worst movie ever,"Im so glad that I saved the money for Top Gun but not this. Probably the worst marvel movie I have ever seen, this movie should named Scarlet Witch: Phyche Madness whatever."
The show is going on!,"Okay, so I will quickly respond to a few 6 out of 10 reviews here as it might confuse the readers of this page.

If you are still thinking of a Marvel movie as a motion picture on its own and you look for the very traditional movie elements when you view a fanfare-like ""Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness"" - you might be going to leave the theatre with a few B minuses on your imaginary notepad. Leave your Michael Mann and Scorsese heads behind and buckle up for the ride.

In other words, this film delivers on all levels you would expect and beyond in its own genre as the continuity of a decades-long superhero mega pillar. We are at the peak of the MCU. No doubts about that. Bridges needed to be built and storylines have to connect with one another over time. The value of what this movie brings can be somewhat identical to the very first team-up concept, The Avengers(2012).

Except now we are in an even bigger ""universe"" compared to the now 10 years old film that broke us on what can be done on the silver screen.

The MCU takes its time and that is why it works. Be patient and view this movie as the new beginning of the next 10 years. Appreciate its ""humble"" efforts because it does it very well.

You will see a new perspective on a superhero movie that was never done before on such a scale. TV series and other movies tie in with great payoffs. The film never fails to promise even more for the future ""episodes"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, stretching its possibilities even further, step by step, with care.

This is something I can only respect when it comes down to running a multi-million dollar business.

In my opinion, the film was great. If you are doing the MCU you will have a fantastic time. For the less fanboy type it might be confusing, so please catch up on the recommended material before walking into the cinema. For example, you must watch Wandavision (which is the best series at the moment from Disney+/Marvel repertoire, Loki close 2nd) to take away the right values and understand some of the motifs of the movie. Elisabeth Olsen finally gets her well-deserved screen time. Almost stealing the show from Ben C. Himself. Not want to spoil anything, but I can comfortably say that Sam Raimi made the right choices during directing this film. Seeing something refreshing, again, after over 10 plus years of superhero movie craze. Is actually madness. In a good way.

First horror movie of the MCU?

Yes. Won't recommend this picture to kids. This film proves that the MCU is growing with the core viewers and still have not reset its target audience's age range. Which is another proof that you dear readers, movie watchers, or fanboys or girls, are still what matters the most to the creators."
Hot garbage,"This movie failed to develop a cohesive plot. It managed to just go in one big circle while jumping universes with entertaining visuals. It lacked depth and development. I didn't appreciate such a dark pivot (borderline horror) within a series. We have established a character with prior movies setting precedent on what to expect. This movie ramped up the gore and broke that trust. Aside from the visuals, it was hot garbage."
Who let sam raimi direct this,
Multiverse of Sadness.,"Marvel scriptwriters are more dependent on the VFX and CGI than actually making content. So much potential in this movie. Trust me so much potential, more deeper, darker and emotional. Could have waited for better scripts and much more vast possibilities. Disappointed."
Just watch it yourself (for good reason),"I personally wouldn't recommend going through the reviews on this one for a simple reason. This is a film that you can tell when watching it would be very divisive. Some really cool direction and horror for Sam Raimi and nice to see a Marvel film where a director has such a big influence. Alongside this some great acting and a very intimidating villain. Was cool to see a more violent and horror based marvel trip but the film isn't without its issues with some scenes that will make you cringe or wish they'd explored things more however, go into it with an open mind and expect to have fun and I believe many will."
Multiverse doesn't disappoint,
Better than The Batman,"There is a ridiculousness that exists among fans. There is no way that this ranks below The Batman, which was really just a boring version of the movie Seven. Man I hated The Batman. I put this here so that when I tell you that this movie was better, it's clear that this movie is good, not great, but good. It throws several interesting curve balls at you and it actually is original in scope. The movie is really more like a seven or a six, but I can't put it there, because the garbage that is The Batman is higher than an 8."
"Unsteady, chaotic and almost good","No good introduction, several surprisingly bad acting moments, chaotic storyline, easy decisions. A mix of horror with sci-fi that unfortunately did not work at all. The writers decisions to find extremely easy ways out. Very unfortunate cuts the first half, then long not-needed scenes. Musically it was just average. Character development was under average. I don't want to spoil the surprise guests in this movie, but money can make things happen that shouldn't happen.

Some moments I rate as 6/10 at best, then 5/10, but for the most part 4/10. Maybe I should give it 5/10, but the last scenes also were definitely between 3/10 av 4/10. I walked out the cinema irritated.

Maybe I was too tired this day, maybe I'm getting old. I love both sci-fi and horror movies. I didn't know it was gonna have this horror side genre in the movie. This should be good for me, but wow, the horror elements were not good at all. Kudos for trying, but it did not work.

I'm sorry, I don't like giving scores under 5 out of 10, but this one I find it surprising has 7,5/10 as of today. This was a literal milking money movie, not needed.

Pro sides:"
"Astonishing,fascinating and the most terrifying MCU !","This movie was so good!

The film really had the feel of Sam Remy's films and it could be felt, the level of the film was high but it also had weaknesses, do not expect the Avengers Infiniti War, but know that the level of the film is much higher than the Sheng Chi films, No Way Home, the Eternals & black widow!

Elizabeth Olsen's performance in this film is amazing and I think it deserves the best awards.

This movie really depicts madness! Congratulations to Marvel and congratulations to Sam Remy."
99% visual effectsz 1% of poor script and trama,Looks that they company that did the visual effects are participating in some kind of contest?? I felt asleep too many times.... And the monster with one eye??? I can create a better monster for sure.
eh it was ok,"Overall the movie was ok but if you're a hardcore wanda fan it may be disappointing, the movie is trying to break out of the usual mcu MO but i don't think it does that effectively i wouldn't go out my way to rewatch."
Really good film,The film has a pretty solid base. The story is well composed by Sam Raimi and the final scene is sooo good. Anyway the special effects weren't that good and even some transition.. I wish they could fix that.. It felt like a 2000's film.
Less mystical more horror/occult,"This outing for Dr Strange was... ok.. its dark.. and full of demonic and dark scenes.. the mystery and mysticism of Dr Strange has been replaced with gruesome makesup, terrifying scenes and basically a film that roars on and on with the audience really giving a hoot who lives or dies. Of course you have to watch it if you love the MCU but in MHO it's the worst of the pack. I wish I'd just missed it... i would be no less aware of the story threads and I wouldn't have scenes that were frankly boring and unnecessarily gruesome."
Superb movie,"Bennett acting excellent, story very innovating. Marvelous. Graphics super. Dheera dheera Bennett acting excellent, story very innovating. Marvelous. Graphics super. Dheera dheera."
Rubbish of a movie!,"Do not see the movie, so unnecessary Poor plot to say the least There is no logical continuation to the previous plots There is no logic or explanation that can be connected to it regarding the current plot And bottom line - one of Marvel's worst movies, and in general, a bad movie in itself Disney is simply riding on the brand and extorting money from the audience."
Wonder is too powerful.,I just can't get my head around how a bit part character in the past few avengers movies becomes one of the most powerful villains. It seems like a lack of imagination.
Just pure fun,"The more I think about it the more I end up liking it. The rating is too high but frankly, it was a fun movie. It had its jump scares and some very good moments that make it redeemable.

For a Marvel fan, this film is full of amazing moments which will definitely make people smile. Unfortunately, this film is held up by WandaVision as it is undeniably a sequel to the show. So for people who haven't watched that it'll be a confusing trip.

The character of America Chavez is pushed into the script which makes for a really annoying plus. However, the actress is a phenomenal, and despite her ridiculous comic accuracy for a Marvel Film, she certainly has potential which she fulfills from time to time.

As for the Sam Rami of it all-it is what makes it so fun. His style of directing creates some captivating moments that are akin to his other films (mainly The Evil Dead franchise). It's not a film to be taken too seriously regardless of it's efforts to do so. After WandaVision this film is too silly to match the heavy impression of loss in Wanda's heart.

Overall, my advice is to go in thinking you'll get Marvel surprises. Expect an over convoluted spectacle with breath taking visuals. This film did not make me cry, it was just pure ridiculous fun."
Just watch this one !! It's very amazing 😍,"I saw few reviews and people criticizing the plot , music , CGI but trust me thats totally opposite. I want to watch the movie again . It's a boom !

Start to end I never felt bored or anything . There were a lot of wow moments and the Quality is just top level . I expect this from marvel after the hype the trailer created."
Scary,"What do you expect when you ask a horror movie producer/director to make a marvel movie. Right title should have been ""Marvel Dead"". About the script, it seems like all the writers took a dump of their 'recycle bin' and built a script out of it."
Scarlet witch is a strangely written character,
Great Horror Film!,"Amazing work by Sam Raimi! Yes, there is witchcraft and other magic in this film. Dr Strange is somewhat of a wizard, so I mean it should be obvious that those things would be included in the film...if you don't like that stuff, just know that's what the film is about before you go complaining about it. The graphic horror scenes were absolutely phenomenal, not too over-the-top, but still shocking in a good way. If you don't want your child to see some crazy horror scenes, just have them wait a few years before watching it. If you enjoyed Ash vs Evil Dead, go watch this film!"
Quite boring,"The first dr Strange movie had a psychedelic vibe (mainly the visuals), which is mainly why I went to see this one. It turned out to be very average, very few 3d fractals, predictable story not just at a high level, but also from one moment to the next. Cringe on occasion. They made scarlet which's kids so much like kids that it seems fake. The teenager girl (America) is also too.. teenagery in the way she behaves. I know teenagers behave like teenagers but she's like all teenagers and no real uniqueness. They tried some jokes but compared to other Marvel movies, it's not that funny. All in all, it's not difficult to watch but it didn't do much for me. 5/10."
Make sure to watch Wandavision and WhatIf before watching this movie,"Loved it and is totally worth the hype! If you haven't watched the series Wandavision and What If, you are probably going to be disappointed like many. This movie is a sequel of these two series and to understand the movie deeply and emotionally you must watch these series. (People who never watched a Marvel movie, please watch everything, including X men before watching MoM 😐 , please don't go to the hall without knowing any backstory and then whine) Those who are complaining about the movie being Wanda oriented, I don't agree. The movie just showed how powerful she is, Wandavision should have prepared you enough to be able to take it."
Duoverse Of Average???,
Didn't meet expectation,It's a good movie but it didnt meet my and my friends expectation u are a fan lower ir expectation its isnt great.its not as good as any other marvel movie.
Whats wrong with people,"I just dont know whats wrong with people giving this film 1 star reviews. Its not necessarily an 8 out of 10 but theres so many unfair bad reviews i had to score it a bit higher. You either like marvel films or you dont. I do. Just for a minute, try to enjoy a superhero film for what it is and stop picking fault at every little thing. It was good, ive watched it 3 times now and enjoyed it each time!"
"Decent, but expected much more",
Good movie for kids.,"I booked the tickets with high expectations but Marvel has disappointed me. The idea of multiverse itself is mind-blowing yet Marvel failed to deliver a well scripted film. Watch this when it's out on Disney+, its not worth your money."
"The visuals fantastic, plot terrible!","The plot is so shallow, there isn't anything interesting happening, hardly any story in it, hardly any connection to either spiderman or the first doctor strange or even loki. The whole story boils down to saying: ""you can do it, you have it in you"" and it's done.

The ""multiverse of madness"" is like one scene and that's it. The whole movie is in 3 universes. The visuals are great i love them.

I have been waiting since 2016 for a doctor strange movie and im greatly disappointed and sad!"
Have not got a clue ????,"I honestly don't get this movie, it's all over the place and I gave the stars for the effects which were great as usual but that's it.

It's extremely fast paced so I can't keep up. I sat through it all feeling quite perplexed !!!!

I gave it 3 stars and that's for the great effects as always but there isn't any spoilers on this review."
The third eye is gross! Of all things,
AN ONE TIME WATCH!,"I watched the movie and my feedback is that it is a much enjoyable movie but I didn't get the satisfaction in my conscience...... although it was good...... In some scenes, it almost exceeded the limits of PG - 13!"
Bit of a mess,
Feeling of wanting more,
Amazing and awesome,I have very good expectaction about this movie also the character is amazing. I love the visual and acting even though the story is confusing. All thanks to Sam Raimu to make this amazing movie.
"Great visuals as always, great storyline",
The Best Marvel movie,"Simple is the Best de horror scene y in all movie parts! Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" had all the ingredients to be a mediocre cog in the ever-more-massive Marvel machine.

It's a sequel to three separate Marvel stories at once, chiefly 2016's meh ""Doctor Strange,"" and it's directed by Sam Raimi, who hasn't made a superhero movie since the widely hated ""Spider-Man 3"" 15 years ago.

But Raimi didn't just deliver a sequel that will satisfy hardcore Marvel fans. Leaning into the sideshow kitsch of a superhero movie about a flying magician in an anthropomorphic cape, Raimi - in a marvelous act of movie prestidigitation - has pulled a cute rabbit from the old Disney hat."
Doctor Estranged In The Motherhood of Madness,"What the title should be :)

It's about trust. Do others trust you?

And being the best version of yourself.

Special effects? Top notch.

Expect a wild ride.

My only gripe: The trailer set high expectations.

Based on the setting (MULTIVERSES!), I expected an ending the scale of Avengers Endgame. There was not.

Still, an epic nonetheless.

End credits scene: there are two. The second one is hilarious.

I only realized its significance minutes after I left."
Unlike anything I've seen from Marvel Studios,"I was surprised in ever moment. Very grim and something we've never seen before. Benedict was mesmerizing in all that he did and still can't believe how far ""Docter strange"" have come since the first installment.

Elizabeth Olsen was amazing and now she is the Scarlet witch."
Disappointed,After such a long wait to see such poor direction was extremely disappointing. Making a horror movie out of a marvel storyline ruins it all. Second credit scene was really bad too. Collective disappointment was palpable from the theatre audience.
very disappointing,
What's that? Audiences are into multiverses? Quick! Release...,"Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness"" Do you like multiverses? Do you like madness? We sure hope so, because those are the only selling points for Marvel's latest CGI masterpiece.

First, the pro's: -I liked Wanda's role in the movie. It was a little overdramatic and many actions were very illogical but overall it was an interesting plot choice that separated this movie from all the other usual superhero plug-n-play plotlines.

-Fancy exploding visuals make eyes go WHEEEEEEE -Acting was generally pretty good, as expected from Cucumberbitch. The newcomer Axolotl (America Chavez) was okay, though I think any fault there was more with her lines/character writing.

-One very entertaining fight scene involving the first and last appearances of several superheroes in the MCU (if you know, you know).

Now the con's: -Having the entire plot revolve around America Chavez made the movie meh. Why did she appear? What exactly is her power/how did she get it? Does she have some cool character development or traits that we can get really invested in? Who knows! Anyways, let's make her attacks/powers * star shaped *

-Most fight scenes (aside from the aforementioned) were very meh as well. When the two biggest power players in the movie (Dr. Strange and Scarlet Witch) fight utilizing magic with very undefined parameters, it's hard to develop any fight strategy or intrigue. Just a bunch of power balls and explosions and grunting with random attacks that are extremely specific (and cool looking! Ooooooooh, a SCORE MUSIC fight, no waaaaaay) but not at all useful or clever. I know this one's a bit of a nitpick, but I guess it bothered me a lot in this movie."
Why didn't Jon Watts direct this movie as well?,
A real miss in timing,
Totally disappointed after watching Dr. Strange multiverse of madness,
Woke nonsense...go back to sleep. Save your money,
Great plot watered down by over hype and poor directing,
Fan service driven like No way home,"After endgame, it seems that Marvel only has fan service to offer in terms of storytelling. Besides that, it has amazingCGI like most marvel films and it's well directed by Sam raimi."
Multiverse of Disappointment,"Was really going into this movie with high hopes, was met with utter disappointment.

Everything from the TV shows and movies before this meant nothing because the characters seemed to have learnt nothing from them. Because character development, who needs that right?

As for the surprise cameos, watch those get butchered in a few seconds and mean absolutely nothing other than to sell a ticket.

Visually there was some interesting parts as it is with movies that feature Doctor Strange or his own movie before this. But besides that it's a hollow, tasteless, messy and convoluted movie that betrays it's characters stories unlike what the folks on the Disney+ shows are doing.

Yes, the TV shows are doing better than a million dollar blockbuster movie..."
"Terrible, terrible, terrible movie.","Just an insult to the Marvel series. This was an awful movie with not much of a plot. I think they tried to be too ""strange"" and went WAY off track for Marvel movies. I want my money back... And my 2 hours."
Wtf was that???,
"I quote the end credits scene: ""It's over."" Finally...","Really wanted to like this movie. I liked the first part, Dr. Strange's appearance in Spiderman and Wandavision. But I don't like this movie. But why?

The fights (apart from the Illuminati scene) are very sluggish, have no exciting music and the effects are more bad than good.

In addition, everything is full of plot holes and annoying film clichés.

Sam Raimi did a great job on the spiderman films in the past. But this Film is unfortunately a low point of Doctor Strange for me."
Horrible!,Worst movie I have watched in a very long time! Could tell if it was horror or a comedy!! Made me wonder if Marvel actually made it or farmed it off to some amateurs!
Only Scarlet Witch Is Saving The Movie..,"I was madly waiting for this movie for years. But I'm disappointed so badly. My only wish was watching Strange and Wanda together. But wasn't like in this such a movie.

I've been waiting to dive into the depths of the multiverses and see many madness and surprises. Whole movie was just so unorganized and VFX were just so trash. Many scenes were feel like cheap, fake and missing.

This movie could have been much better but they wasted their chances...

The best thing about this movie was just seeing my beloved Scarlet Witch on big screen. I'm really happy about Wanda for being that much powerful and badass. The things she has done was the only excitement for me. Blood, madnees, darkness, jumpscares.

America Chavez was definitely the most time waster character. They could give that time to Wong.

After credit was so in rush and suddenly, I couldn't even feel anything about it."
"Tear breaking, but Sometimes Goofy.","Movie had it sentiments and it delivered, shedding tears at the very start. Sam Raimi did good on delivering the plot and the emotion. Though, sometimes the fight scenes were unnecessary and goofy."
A Couple Steps Up From The Boring Pretentious First Film,"This movie was amazing and it's personally my favorite marvel movie so far while not perfect (mostly because of length and some cheesy dialogue) I think this is a very satisfying entry into the mcu and I'm excited for the sequel.

Ps- and by length I almost felt it was too short for the story they tried to tell should've at least been 30-40 minutes longer I felt like I didn't get be in the multiverse enough like some of the other reviewers were saying a hell of a lot of madness (which I loved btw) and not nearly enough multiverse."
Wandavision 2,
Dr Strange : Multiverse of Madness.,"I enjoyed this movie. It took some of the winning ideas from the other films and applied them. A few shake your head moments but those were not enough to derail the enjoyment of the film. Do not expect the big payoff like end game or phase ending movies. This is clearly a step towards another film or two for Dr Strange. The villain was good and you understand their motivation. There were a few points of fan service which was actually decent for a change as it tied in other stories in the MCU. Additionally, there was some remnant of the Dr Steven Strange and his character flaws which was nice in terms of subtle character development. Finally, i was underwhelmed by the score. Most of the other MCU films had decent musical scores. Avengers, Captain America, Iron Man etc..

Good movie, Not excellent but worth a watch in theatre. I have high hopes for Stranger things ahead."
Not enough,
Disappointed,
The Multiverse of Meh,"The first half hour is good, but this is by far the most poorly made of all the Marvel movies so far.

I can't believe I shaved above the knee for this."
Multi-level downgrade,"This film was more like a Bollywood film than anything else. You see lots of inconsistencies and extra stuff here and there that just don't make sense. There is no fixed protagonist and the story feels crumbled.

Spoilers: no major spoiler but it helps from here.

Dude what the hell, power of friendship and stuff was in this movie. Stuff like ""I know you can do it"".

Marvel has made few of my all time favourite movies. Winter soldier made a rethink my life. That thing was deep.

Phase 4 Marvel has been nothing but disappointment."
Best movie since Far From Home,"I wanted give the film 9/10 but reading so many bad reviews I had to give it 10/10 to try and bring the rating up. I don't understand what is with people calling it the worst film, boring or confusing. It's a very good movie, with a simple yet intricate plot, beautiful visuals, excellent scores and nice cameos without too much fan service. Those who haven't yet watched the film please don't listen to others and go watch this film in theaters. It's an absolute treat."
An exciting Multiverse waiting to be revealed!,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is the most horror movie in the MCU. This film has a lot of suspense and action sequences ever. However, I would recommend not bringing any younger viewers. There are some scenes that may scare them. Benedict Cumberbatch played Doctor Strange so much fun and better. Elizabeth Olsen played Scarlet Witch so much AWESOME!!"
Entertaining sequel,
An amazing movie!,
So very disappointed!,
The laughs. The scares. The exploding heads. Oh My.,"Finally we have arrived. Lil bit of spooky, a lotta bit weird. Bravo to Sam Raimi who is clicking on all cylinders with this entry into the MCU. Kevin Feige and the crew did it again. What I wanted going to see this previously to seeing it. Dr strange doing some weird stuff, and Wanda strait up wrecking fools. What I got watching this movie: Dr strange doing some weird stuff, and Wanda strait up wrecking fools."
Good... Not Great,
Amaizing perfomance Cast of film actors,"Fantastic show, insane style of the multiverse of insanity. Bravo, Sam Raimi. Excellent story and directing. I am delighted with the acting of a wonderful cast. One of the best superhero movies of recent years."
Awesomeness!!!,"I loved this movie so much! The action never stoped. I just got into MCU about 3 Years ago and this is one of the best ones in my opinion! I will Admit it was a little creepy that's way it's 9/10 But it was so fun! Would recommend for teens who like action, adventure, and a bit of creepiness."
"Some interesting elements, but messy",
Won't Kevin Fiege Watch The Movie Befo,"It was Good, visuals were Amazing and Every Actors Performance was Top Notch But Come onn mannn Is This ""The Multiverse Of Madness"". I am Very Very Very............. HeartBroken To Say This, What A Huge Let Down Of Expectation nd left with Unfulfilled Satisfaction. I don't like to spoil the story here, so i am keeping complaints for myself for some days. Started Strong finished Weak. It Rushed So Much, i am a Huge fan of Marvel studios, The Movie Name did not kept it's Promise."
VERY NICE MOVIE,
"Chaotic, unnecessarily intense/ violent and overall disappointing",
Doctor Strange in The Factory of Sadness,
Conflicted,"First of all i am fan of mcu. I liked too much girst of movie doctor strange's. It was fine but second one it does not look like based story on doctor strange instead of him more than like scarlet witch's movie. If you do not watch wandavision you can miss too many details about films so that i suggested.to who want to watch this movie, you have to watch first of all that wanda vision series. Story is not good aswell it is soo classic finish scene end of movie."
Deviates painfully from what we expect of the MCU,
More than avarage,
Some almost redeeming qualities,"There is a lot to like about this movie as long as you don't think too long about it. The visuals are amazing. The artistic choices and the skill of the animators are as good as it gets. Really wish I could freeze frame in theaters to appreciate it more. The story incorporates a few splashes of genuine horror as well, refreshing as I don't recall the last time a marvel movie had the gusto to put potentially frightening material in their movies.

Where it goes downhill is the writing, mainly the plot and character assassinations. The story itself feels like no thought or care was put into it. It was the first idea they had to wrap up what they wanted to. Without getting into spoiling it, they expect you to just accept what happens. There's no good reason for the characters to behave the way they do, they just do it because that's what the plot needs. Characters aren't as intelligent as they used to be, they aren't as funny as they used to be, and they don't put together a compelling story. There was a splash of horror but that's it, and I feel like if they took that and ran with it they could've created a better story surrounding those horror elements but instead they deliver a CGI tech demo with a flimsy story thats main purpose is to set up sequels and spin offs. Because that's what phase 4 marvel seems to be about, setting up and creating product with writing quality taking a back seat. And I hate to say it, but if Gomez is a good actress, it didn't show here.

That being said it has some redeeming qualities. Visually stunning as any movie has been and the spooks are nice and adds another layer this movie desperately needed, just needed more of it. If there was ever a movie to turn your brain off to and watch the pretty colors, this is it."
Predictable strange in mom,Movie was fun and Benedict Cumberbatch acts were superb but I felt like this one could have been a bit longer and on more thing why the hell was Dr strange made sidekick in his own movie it more seemed like Wanda maximoff in the pursuit of her children.. American Chavez was good nd I hope next part will have nice story.
Incredibly disappointing in every respect,"What can I say? I had trouble just getting past the blatant, in-your-face wokeness (lesbian 'moms', pride flag on America's lapel) to actually try and keep up with the ridiculous mishmash of .... I'm still not sure what. Skip it. You won't regret it."
Not what i expected!,"Movie was quite good but,i expected more.sam Rami tried to make it scary and also tried to give us jumpscares but it didn't worked!!

But worth watching ."
Amazing,It was an amazing movie and the different layers Elizabeth Olsen added to Wanda was spectacular. Wanda's villain arc was so thrilling with its jumpscares and all that it really made the movie that much better.
"Good for toddlers, just like Shazam!","Yasir Omer got all of us to watch yet another lame movie 😏 Yasir Omer's good decisions = bad decisions If Yasir rates a movie 8.5, its probably a 4 at best..."
Its better then the first movie,"Marvel is starting to get into to the Multiverse world slowly. Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness is a great follow up after the latest of Spider-man No way home.

The movie was very creative, innovative and every character made sense. The movie had a good dialogue aswell. One heads up the movie had suprising horror scenarios which you will see in this movie.

One negative thing might be that this was one very colorful movie then what we are used too. A real splash of colors, but as long it have good Character development & story its worth 8/10."
Unexpected Touch to a Marvel Movie,
"A great movie, but we just expected too much",
Feels like I'm watching a marvel horror movie.,"This movie brings a new type of vibe marvel has never done before. I feel like they picked the right director for this. Just my opinion this movie would be 2x better if marvel has completely turn it into an R Rated movie. On the negative end, I feel like this movie doesn't have enough of doctor strange. The main villain was unexpected for me."
Was this a joke?,"Worst Marvel content I have ever watched. I am a MCU fan and even though there were some movies that I didn't like I have never left a bad review, but now I just can't.. this was a total disappointment and I want to leave this bad review because I don't understand why it has such a big score on imdb and how people actually enjoyed it. I know the story is part of some comic ideas I never liked but it could have been enjoyable if the movie script wasn't written so bad: from cringe conversations/action e.g ""beat the villain with the power of friendship"" to jump scares that did not belong e.g even from a horror movie point of view it was bad."
"Bad, worst, then comes Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)","The whole portrayal is bad, movies and comics are not the same, you know that. That has been proven before. But why make the same mistake like Spiderman 3 (2007)?"
Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch,"Starting with the first thing, the title of the movie as such ""Multiverse Of Madness"" is a bit big, and that's what has me a bit disappointed in the film. A title like Doctor Strange and the Scarlet Witch or the Darkhold, would be perfect. To my CRITERIA the title is a matter of ""clickbait"".

The first parts are a bit slow, and the others a bit faster. In my opinion the cameos were ok, it has a balance (I didn't expect more). A few scenes were unnecessary for the plot (I would give more time to the Illuminati moment). The trailers show what you're really going to see, no more, no less. A few ""surprises"", but no surprises. The ""suspense"" is ok, but if it didn't have it, it doesn't change much.

The good thing is the acting, it's a film by Elizabeth Olsen and Xochitl Gomez, although Cumberbatch is no slouch. It's a balance between witchcraft and sorcery, different terms. Sam Raimi's direction is AWESOME, whatever it is, you can tell he did his best. The visual effects are good, and the music has his style (you know also to the tastes of Sam Raimi). The plot is well told in general terms, going a little out of the way of the super heroes without leaving completely, there is a balance between the characters, but if one of them over comes out. The comedy that Marvel adds to their productions, in this one in particular, is little, 2 or 3 jokes and that's it. It's a well edited film, very clean photography, the CGI is good, you know, Marvel style.

I must say that the 4th phase of the UCM is full of strong feelings and situations and they are projecting them in an AWESOME way.

You don't need to see 66 movies to understand the plot, just by being aware of UCM and watching WandaVision and Doctor Strange 1, all good, you understand him. Yes there are some references, but they don't take more than 3 seconds and there aren't many.

My rating is for the title, but I understand that Marvel's projects are long term and just like that, as brushstrokes, they are touching the theme of the MULTIVERSE. (and in this movie too)"
Not Enough Multiverse Explored,Well.. with story coming off right after Spiderman No Way Home and considering what an amazing storyline and performances it had. It's a disappointment. Even the multiverse is not much explored. Story line is a minus. Overall one time watch.
Epic MARVELOUS and truly mesmerizing movie,"Director Sam Raimi works his magic by giving the audience an entertaining multiverse saga by packaging it smartly with the elements that he believes can cast a spell on them, irrespective of their love for the MCU."
My style of a superhero movie and I don't like super hero movies. One of the best ever made!,"Sam raimi is a great visionary. Ground breaking CGI with original storytelling and unusual plot twists. A sorcerer, a witch, and a reminder of any good horror movie should be. Zombie themes and my style of superhero movie to a T. But I love Sam raimi!"
Nothing compared to the first part,Boring film. Bad screenplay. No direction to the story. Definitely a big step down from No way home. First part is way better. Watch it for VFX and Sound mix nothing more.
Marvel did it wrong with Doctor Strange,
Raimi's Flavour,"Doctor Strange in the MoM is an undeniably a Sam Raimi film. Mostly deranged - infused with macabre elements and as diabolical as MCU will ever get. No breaks, all gas from start to finish."
Wanda-verse of Strange-ness,A good story on its own but you dont just take the connected timeline story way off on another path especially after building the hype of this being a continuity of the events at the end of No Way Home. Biggest let down of the year!
A marvel movie made for evil dead fans,
It's like Wanda Vision S02,"-Weak script
Very campy
Jokes not Funny
Not serious enough
America Chavez there for only LGBT+ purpose
Short length & too much focus on wanda."
Hopes are uncompletely complete.,
Epic!,"The movie is really great! I wish it was 3 hours long! I always love both doctor strange and scarlet witch, hope to see them both again in future movie."
its just the announcement about multiverse,
America Chavez in doctor strange,
"It's good, but could have been much better","I felt like it was a good movie, but unfortunately I left the theater not feeling like I want to watch it again to see more details, etc... Like I felt when I watched Spider-man no way home, for example.

I thought Marvel could have explored more of those cameos, with more screen time and more significant roles (I thought just 2 characters of those cameos were really awesome, the rest was like... okay...).

Also, the CGI and special effects definitely was not on point. I see a big let down in this regard on Phase 4... The infinity saga had an incredible level of editing, special effects and CGI and I don't see the same after Avengers Endgame.

Overall a 6.7 ~ 7.0 out of 10 for me. Hopefully the next ones will be better."
Illuminati,
Exceeded expectations,
TERRIBLE!,
just bad,
Overall fun to watch,
Great Movie Can Watch Multiple times,"Great Movie. I do not know why people do not like it. Great movie with great direction. Starting was great. I would suggest that people read about the comic characters before going to movies so that you do not feel necessary for character build up. This is the Dr strange movie and it serves it purpose. I think people did not watch wanda vision to understand the motivation for wanda. Its not perfect but its feel good movie. It is a movie you can watch multiple times without getting tired. The flow of movie is perfect and do not have unnecessary parts. I understand people are complaining about not having much multiverse but What would you expect than the 4 variants of Dr strange in one movie? Additionally, this movie puts foundation of multiverse and it will be explored in future projects. Overall it is great and entertaining movie with small and forgivable flaws. Definitely watch again after it comes in Disney plus. My suggestion will be to expect it to be Dr strange movie and you will be happy with the result."
Dr Strange a new marvel fans view,"Often would give this sort of film a miss, however after being recommended by a friend to watch the first, I couldn't t give this a miss. Ensure you give Wanda vision a watch before hand or you will miss some key elements to the film.

The film itself is a is visually spectacular, almost as good as the first dr strange. It keeps you attention right from the start, and continues through out.

The film develops well and has a good balance of comedy, action and horror throughout. Madness at times is a slight understatement. Most of the film fitted in nicely however a couple of scenes really did not need to be included.

The acting is mostly very good but a few times lacks the consistency I would expect, but we do get to see the characters develop further.

The film in total is an entertaining watch and felt shorter than 2 hours, and I'm looking forward to the next one."
I'm outraged for Stan Lee,They are moving away from great story telling and substituting horror and gore. I did like some of the ideas but execution was more about Disney plus characters more screen time for subscriptions.
This movie is like of Spider-Man nwh...,"I anticipated watching spider man nwh so much and seeing the old spider men that were rumored to be in it. I remember I would have dreams that I finally saw the movie and they didn't put in the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield Spider-Man and it was the biggest feeling of disappointment and let down. That's exactly how I felt watching this movie. Their is a 10 minute scene where they have all the multiverse cameos jammed in and it's cool. But when you realize that's the peak of the movie, and nothing else is coming, it is outrageously disappointing. I'd constantly see things on the internet how people said this movie was going to be crazier than endgame, nwh, and infinity war combined. And it would have more marvel characters than any other marvel movie. I am the easiest person to please, I even enjoyed movies like the 2014 fantastic 4 and eternals. This movie just sucked, it was a snooze fest. Don't get your hopes up."
Some soaring heights and crushing lows,
They dont really Use the potentials,
This was definitely more straight to Disney+ quality,This was definitely more straight to Disney+ quality. Great graphics but storyline was lacking. Of course there had to be a lesbian couple trying to be woke.
Creepy Marvel Kill Bill,
Madness Guaranteed,"This has to be one of the messiest movies I've ever watched, the plot is long, stretched there are countless and countless scenes of action some with very little purpose. It also doesn't feel all too much like a Dr. Strange movie like the prequel did. What it does do is entertain. The movie is long, but didn't feel long. It felt like a breeze when actually watching it, probably because of the amount of things going on. The movie definitely doesnt deserve prizes for writing directing or even acting, but also with the little horror-movie like touches added on if you're a marvel fan it is worth your time because of it's entertainment value."
Wanda didn't learn a thing after what she did in Wandavision!,
"I loved it, great scenario","Their performance was incredible, and the CGI was brilliantly rendered. The multiverse is a concept that I enjoy, and seeing one character in several variations is incredible; there is the evil one, the righteous one, and many more is a sight that I must see in the future."
Bad script,"Only plus points were going to the special effects.

The whole storyline is bad and i mean wtf was the fighting at 1h33""?

Those script writers were on drug i think."
it's like watching a two-hour bonus scene,
Underwhelming story line,
I thought it was a great movie,This is my first review and I had to comment based on all the other negative reviews I have been reading. I thought this was great movie. CGI is top notch. I don't know why people take things too seriously. Just enjoy that we get to experience these kinds of movies instead of complaining all the time.
Rubbish excuse for graphics,All flash this movie. One of the worst films I have ever seen. This was an excuse for amazing graphics and not much more. Poor story line and frustrating writing (you are being chased and finally find the thing that will save you and you stop to look and ponder ) These movies are becoming glossy colours to throw at the masses and make money. I used to enjoy these movies but the latest ones are lure drivel.
Sam Raimi messed this up and script is terrible,"Sam Raimi wasn't the right choice to direct this, his direction was childish, felt I am watching high budget evil dead.

Story is so bad that it's irritating at times. Everyone using their super powers as per the convenience of the story.

Terrible addition to MCU movies. It's so bad it collected 1 billion dollars."
Script was okay,
Wasnt worth the hype,Apart from the stunning visuals and cgi this movie might have not fulfilled expectations of an average MCU fan. Although Benedict Cumberbatch and Elizabeth Olsen delivers a masterpiece action often times the movie felt disconnected and writing of the movie is mediocre.
Give back my money,This was one of the worst movie i ever watched. Marvel is literally testing my patience. I thought Morbius was the worst marvel movie but i was wrong. Didn't Marvel watch the movie themselves before releasing it. Too much fan service and too little story. Like what was the story about. My Disappointment Is Immeasurable And My Day Is Ruined.
Horror elements aren't my cup of tea,Apart from the visuals I didn't like the movie sadly because I'm a fan of Wanda. Mainly because the horror elements of the film weren't for me. Also I think they centered around this parts and miss huge opportunities in the development of the caracteres new and old.
Marvel has done so much better,"Disappointing movie from start to finish. I'm not sure where to begin because I'm not sure what I just watched. It's a mess from start to finish. Why on earth (616 or others) are we suddenly digging into super dark territory for a universe of films centered on superheroes saving the world from some bad guys. Marvel was pretty much stuff the whole family could watch now it's just pathetic dark elements that just bring down the whole name of Marvel movies. Super shameful for Marvel and Disney to go this far into that stuff knowing young kids look up to these movies. I could go on and on, but the movie already did that."
New and interesting spin on a somewhat repetitive formula,"Though this film suffers from many marvel -ish ailments (vague and sometimes unbelievable plot, shaky dialogue), it brings a unique angle with horror tones and a tense and exciting middle-part. The CGI is excellent, and cUmberbatch and Olson are great in their respective roles. If you're a long time marvel fan (like me), I definitely recommend seeing this one, but for outsiders I'd say sit this one out."
It was phenomenal,"Tbh the people who rated it low just don't know enough of the backstory and context. It was amazing. Everything made sense, so many characters from marvel came out and I was SO HAPPY to see them."
It was Wanda's movie. I'm happy with that.,"No idea where this is going. Was hardly a Multiverse of Madness , Love Wanda though.

Hardly let the expectations but then again the bar was set too high for this movie."
TOTALLY BORING NO STORYLINE,"What happened the first film was great. This one has a very thin story line and is just one fight after another. Yuk.

The acting was poor and this film was just about special effects,. Double yuk."
The Metaverse implodes on all sides.....,"Not gonna lie, i had very high hopes for this movie, and it didn't get close to reaching them. After seeing the (worse) blunder of Thor Love & Thunder i'm starting to realize that Marvel's high volume slate of content is starting to condemn itself from within. I think the original ideas of these movies are getting torn apart, due to time constraints, or random needs for the adherence of ""continuity"" for the Marvel universe. Which is funny.... considering there hasn't been much up to this point in phase 4. More on that later.

I have all the faith in the world that the Scott Derrickson's MoM would have blown my mind.... could he really not make his own movie and still work within the confines of Marvel continuity? I guess we'll never know, and are likely to keep suffering compromises, in the form of last minute plot changes, reshoots, or otherwise forced deviations from the original ideas. Marvel had some serious misses with Dr Strange and Thor this year, and i really hope they make it up with a proper banger at some point when all the continuity building starts to spell out their greater macro storyline. At this point i don't have a ton of faith in Wakanda Forever, but.... i do think Quantumania has potential, with Kang reverentially capable of bringing some properly high stakes.

With all of the sacrifices being made in plotlines and movie execution i'm having trouble keeping faith with Marvel's macro direction not being well defined this far into phase 4. They need to set way higher stakes within their world-building, and soon.... before their fanbase loses steam completely."
"""Madness of Scarlet Witch""",
Disappointed,"A huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, but the movie lacked depth and direction. CGI effects were good and I watched to the end, hoping there would be."
Great visuals and designs but lacking in plot,Visually it's a strong 9.5 Plot however is uneven and logic of some characters is very immature at times which is making the whole show less believable.
Like Watching a Disney Channel Movie with a $200M Budget,
Great Actors terrible politics,Sorry I turned off at the universe with 2 mums. How was she conceived ? Trite woke nonsense. How this got a 7 / 10 I'll never know. It never stops surprising me how loonies in Hollywood cater for this tiny minority of loonies in the world.
Classic Sam Raimi MCU Film (NO SPOILER REVIEW),"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is already the 28th entry to the MCU franchise and still Marvel continues to deliver new and exciting experiences to the fandom. What can only considered an entry in the horror genre, Multiverse of Madness succeeded on all fronts with its crazy and bizarre out of this universe premise. The film did not shy away in its weirdness as it expanded on the concept of multiverses originally introduced in WandaVision, Loki, What If?, and the latest Spiderman film, No Way Home. Helmed by the one and only Sam Raimi (known for directing the original Spiderman trilogy, and the Evil Dead series), he masterfully crafted a unique and visually stunning experience. If you are a fan of Raimi like me, you will be surely be delighted as this film is filled with his signature flashy and dynamic direction (and his brand of humor). Being a master of horror-comedy, it is in full display here and I relish every second of it. Being a PG 13 movie, he might have made some compromises here but some scenes are borderline Rated R for depictions of gore and shock and I loved it. Once again, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is as charismatic as ever and continued to be impressive in this role. It is also worth noting the strong performance of Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch) which greatly added to the emotional weight of the story. As expected from MCU, the cinematography is breathtaking with visuals that are reminiscent of the colorful panels of comic books. The music is also worth mentioning as it added another tool for storytelling, and Danny Elfman did a wonderful job in scoring every scene. My only complaint is that there is some pacing issues near the beginning as the film tries to explain the concept of multiverses. Once the action picks up though, it is non stop.

In conclusion, this is a classic Sam Raimi film. Fans of his will have the added bonus of seeing nods and winks from his previous works. As an MCU film? It definitely stand toe to toe with the best of its entries. It is entertaining from start to finish, and I just can't wait on what the future holds now for Marvel as the gates of multiverses are open.

9 out of 10."
A Sam Raimi film from start to end.,"You always wondered what a big budget Sam Raimi film would look like in the 2020's? Here is it. One of the most unique, strange and visualy interesting films of the MCU by a fair margin. The overly complex yet simple plot of the movie doesn't ruin the masterfull visual experience. It's a treat for the eyes (and ears, you know what i'm talking about). I loved that Marvel had the guts to let Raimi do his gory bizarre stuff. Pays a fair decent amount of tribute to classics like The Terminator and The Evil Dead without hammering (like Rogue One did for example). A fantastic despite all it's flaws in the script and pacing. A definitive most watch for horror fans and expecialy Raimi fans particularly."
End of era of marvel movies,"First black widow, now this trash movie. Marvel you doing not well.

My advice: do not go!!! Believe me I went with great expectations, but this movie is by far the worst ever! This is not a marvel movie, its a horror movie.

Terrible. Shame. Weakness."
Surprise,
Vfx and story,One of the best movie of Marvel with different story I loved it on 3d screen waiting for nest MCU movie this movie is out of the world vfx cgi amazing characters and last post credit scene was awesome love this movie.
Madness definitely ensues,"Wanda vision set up the scarlet witch and this movie proved she was unstoppable. The first doctor strange was a cohesive narrative that followed a seemingly fitting chronological order of events, but it is a movie that holds ur hand the whole way through and tells you everything you need to know.

This movie on the other hand does not hold ur hand and perfectly captures the madness element. For those who feel ""underwhelmed"" that is simply due to the fact that your expectations betrayed you. To adore this movie it needs to be critiqued as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and not as the movie after no way home or the first doctor strange story since What ifs masterpiece, ep 4.

While I definitely think an extra 20 mins in this movie would have been nice to extend some of the scenes and dialogue which felt rushed. Missing moments that you just then needed to imagine happened.

Other than that, this movie was nothing but madness and I have more questions after it than before it and I just hope that doctor strange will return... just not taking 6 years this time around."
Pretty dull CGI no-brainer maybe better if a mini-series,
another excellent work by sam raimi,"Another excellent work by sam raimi

Definitely the most daring movie in marvel.

Absolutely phenomenal. The camera work, the music, the acting it's all great. Elizabeth Olsen is truly great, this is a must-see! The cameo's don't overshadow the current plot and they don't take too much screen time, speaking of time the pace of this movie is so fast you'll be entertained the whole time!"
Boring and Nonsensical,
One of my worst Marvel's Movies I have ever seen,"Even the story was so bad, and we were waiting for a lot of characters, the scenes of the trailer were all the scenes from the movie, at the same time the TV spots spoiled a lot of things one of them is Captain Carter, the name of the movie is Doctor Strange but the movie focuses on Wanda.

I didn't have lunch yesterday just to go to cinema and watch this movie and i was so excited to see it but I regret it so much, because it didn't give me so much pleasure.

Hope it's not disappointing me to watch the next marvel's movie: Thor LAT."
Dr strange,
"Not great, not terrible","The movie is well put together which you'd expect from a seasoned director. But the movie never goes above the mediocrity and never gives you a 'wow' moment. To me, Dr Stranger's battle with himself was cool. Benedict Cumberbatch is a great actor and he commands the screen everytime he's in the scene. I wish there was more of him and less of the cameos and other fluff.

The story is very weak, especially if you haven't seen a particular TV series, you'd be left confused. The weakest point by far was America Chavez. Her acting was straight out of a school play. She ad a single expression for every emotion. In the end when she tries to act confident, we all strated laughing as her attempt to 'look' determined came across goofy. It doesn't help that she has to play against an Oscar winner actor in most scenes.

Overall, it wasn't as bad as I was expecting, but nothing to rewatch."
Unfortunately this episode is very weak!!!,"I was looking forward to watching this episode for so long, but I was shocked when I saw this.

Such weak story!!!

I am a big fan of Marvel universe and have seen all the sequels several times. But This Dr. Strange movie is really a disappointment! The story is very very weak.

If you do not have a good story, it is best to let it be."
Another MCU Phase 4 disappointment,"My wife and I thought The Eternals was a stumble towards the bottom of the barrel. This movie proves it's on purpose. Sam Raimi barely watched WandaVision to direct this, couldn't be bothered to watch 8 hours of TV from the people footing this multi hundred million bugdet film.

Character plots are badly handled, so many moments where the script breaks established laws of the MCU. The world building is either so thin or so distorted it's like watching Star Wars 8 all over again. Please Disney, stop turning respected properties into garbage fires. Doctor Strange was praised by critics and amateur video essayists. Avengers Infinity Wars proved you can write super heroes movies and write them properly. Make bank and provide quality entertainment.

Phase 1-2-3 was built on folowing the thread of what was made before. So far none of the shows or movies tie in to anything else phase 4. Loki's Kang should be all over the place by now. Where's Shang Chi, didn't Wong get him earlier?

Asking for continuity trhoughout movies is a lot, I know but this movie cant keep up from the previous movie for which it is a sequel, let alone scene from scene Strange's cloak will fly him 100 m in the air but can't hold him upright while he's fainting? Wasn't it fighting bad guys on its own in the first movie? Did the people making this film alsk not watched that movie. I'm not a comics diehard nitpicker, i just like narrative's that are consistent and hold together, especially at the price point of this media property."
Good but not Best yet,"A great movie to watch. Everything has been displayed appropriately. It is absolutely chaos and madness all over yet it lacks the action in the multiverse. If the run time was extra 20 min and all the Illuminati were there, and proper display of power from them would been amazing. I felt the introduction of Illuminati was for nothing.

Overall good action pack movie, all the actors/actresses have presented it well."
expectations failed.,"When i saw imdb ratings, i tought people gave lower ratings because of darkness of the movie, on the other hand i like dark spirited movies.

Movie has very nice ideas/concepts but executions are somehow mediocre.

Battle scenes are short and spiritless, there is no single goosebumps scene when watching movie and even after a long time i wont be rewatching the movie as a whole or rewatching battle scenes with goosebumps."
Cop out for number 3,Great action ect ect some corny parts. Bad person was a cop out totally didn't fit the past of their character. I hope some real villains are in number 3... really wanted to see more of the multiverse.
Dissapointed,
That's It? Now I'm The Mad One.,"For all of it's majestic and creative moments, this experience did not land for me. It's flat story and disjointed writing kept me from feeling invested in what should of otherwise been a horror mash up masterpiece."
"The writers are messing with us, right?","Bob, screen writer at Marvel, talking to Joe, another writer.

Bob: ""Wait, people are still paying to watch our movies?""

Joe: ""Yeah, I know, right!? I thought the movies would run out of steam ages ago XD""

Bob: ""Same. But no, even though we've just been messing about with the scripts and making them weirder and spending less time on them, people still pay for them""

Joe: ""Yeah. The last script I wrote I finished in like two days. All you need is a few male characters, some one liners, plenty of fighting scenes and a woman that needs saving.""

Bob: ""Oh, and make the antagonist a woman too, but let her main motivation be something like her husband or children!""

Please, Marvel, put more time and love into your movies. Stop putting together weirdly cut scenes with wooden sounding dialogues. Also, please work on your character portrayals."
One time watch if you have free time,"I went with more hope of trailer but seems lot missing and story could have been way more better. The way it represented is good so you won't bored a lot. Also, you must watch WandaVision before watching this movie."
"History had good potential, bad execution","I loved the first delivery of dr. Strange. I had high expectations for this one.

I feel the idea had potential but the execution was like eternals film. Lots of madness little explanation, coherence.

To add to all of this, this film has little of terror, boldness and scenes that I felt I was early hung a zombies movie, not a hero's movie.

Then I realized the director did other zombie movies."
"WILD. Genre confusion, please read before you get hurt","TL;DR: Thriller/horror movie featuring superheroes. Definitely a ""wild"" movie.

The movie is not under the normal genre for Marvel and uses dark/grim to try and prove that it isn't always a happy universe. The result? Having graphic deaths and murders thrown in your face that make the movie feel very out of place in the MCU. My wife and I were shocked at what we were watching; we came to see the intelligent, clever Dr. Strange, not a celebration of possession, unkillable monsters, or jump scares. I had been very close to taking some younger siblings/friends kids with me - I am SO glad that I did not. This is not the unconditionally family friendly movie MCU usually shows.

If the genre was not MCU-usual, the sub-par writing was. The villain emerges in an out-of-character fashion, under the guise of emotional grief, mental instability, coupled with magical corruption. The incredible visual effects are both stunning and aggressive - but not quite enough to cover bad dialogue, escape cringey comedy, or mask the amount of wasted material. One thing I hate seeing is introducing constant new material without developing anything fully; this movie is fast paced and dumps new characters and scenes onto the viewer, but just as quickly abandons them. The world building is somehow both constant and shallow. The pace wasn't bad, but really takes nothing with itself; the middle of the movie could be spliced and it would still follow. Character development is a mixed bag - one protagonist makes some admirable headway, while others have token moments of ""self-realization"" in the last sequence that win the day. A particular character has a role constituting little more than being chased, which is a disappointing limit on what the character could have brought to the table with a richer story or exploration. I was heartbroken with what they did to the villain; you may disagree. Some characters have major regression. A number of beloved characters are introduced to the fan's delight, but this is soon used to betray the audience. The response to the evils in the film are also not addressed well by the characters - there is no processing of anything that happens, and all is seemingly forgotten by everyone for a happy ending for the heroes that is not felt by the unsettled audience. While unexpected elements are bombarding the audience from start to finish, the general Marvel character formula is not.

Ultimately a very mediocre film, but with the problem of being marketed to the wrong audience. If I had known what this movie was, I wouldn't have gone, and neither would any of those who were with me. Others who are more prepared may enjoy the film more. Also, couldn't they have waited until Halloween to release it?"
Massive letdown for Doctor Strange fans,
Great Potential... Poor Execution,"As highlighted by other reviewers, the pacing of this movie was disappointing. Also, the plot is too simple for a movie encompassing the Multiverse, and the excessive CGI fails to create a believable Multiverse."
"Well, it was Marvel polished, but very little Doctor Strange",
It's a step in a right direction with some cost,"Come on viewers. If you watch this movie in a theatre and couldn't catch up, don't give it a bad review solely because of that. It's like you are playing a video game and you can't beat it, and then you call this game garbage. It's similar to Nolan's TENET, where people can't catch up and give it a bad review.

Ok, let's talk about this one. It's a Marvel's superhero movie. Like the comics, it will eventually evolve into extremely powerful superheroes and multiverse. Why? Because without those, in order to have a new story, you either watch the old superheroes fight another villain nobody cares or introductions of a new superhero with a backstory and the same old ""from Peter Parker to Spider-Man"" development.

So it features a mega powerful superhero/villain and multiverse. Upsides:

1. Each universe can have a big threat - a superhero/villain we have known got way too powerful,which we can relate to instead of let's say Steppenwolf from Justice League.

2. Heroes can die easily which intensifies the war. Is it a real war without someone died? Ok in Endgame Iron Man, Black Widow and Vision are gone. There is a hole needed to be filled. With Multiverse, no problem, there are Iron Man from other universes and there are universes without Dr Strange etc.

3. Diversity. In this universe Dr Strange is a superhero. In another universe he is a supervillain. Endless possibilities, endless threats, endless solutions.

Downsides:

1. It's more fan focused. The characters you know may become someone completely different. You need to watch what happened in the series before to understand what is happening.

2. Story moves fast. Characters in different universes are doing different things. Hard to catch up for some people.

Finally, let's talk about the plot. Once again, it's a superhero fiction. Do not take it too seriously. It's supposed to have fun, great visuals, unexpected twists and actions. Otherwise it's gonna be another Age of Ultron where everyone takes it seriously and it's not fun anymore.

I admit the logic behind the motivation and realisation of Scarlet Witch is a bit questionable. And there's some loopholes in the plot. But if you want pure logic from a movie, watch Inception etc. While this is just a fun superhero movie where you are amazed by what happened, and wandering what happens next.

I like the approach of this movie. It's not towards general audience anymore but Marvel fans. Sure it will upset a lot of people who except an old Marvel formula where the superheroes are grouped to face a different villain. However there will only be one Thanos, one Joker. And there's homework needs to be done before watching it.

I don't think a series which face general audience will become great. This movie is by no means perfect, but it's a right direction to keep the series we love alive."
Marvel heading for Madness,
Movie plot,
Multiverse??? Nahhh,"Movie was ok, but no MULTIVERSE nor Madness. It was just another episode (a loooong one) of some Marvel series. No relevance, everything is the same after this movie."
A real candidate for the worst MCU film yet.,"Let me start by saying I was excited going into this movie and had fairly high expectations. Coming off of Spiderman, I was hoping for a little less nostalgia bombing and a lot more creative storytelling. What I got was poorly written garbage dumb of a film who's cinematography was it's only real saving grace.

The storyline is the weakest point. It was fairly linear and easy to follow for being so-called ""madness"" but it doesn't deliver much substance beyond the basic plot points and barely kept my interest. In an attempt to be edgy and horrifying, much of the story centred around satanist themes and imagery that was well beyond what was necessary or even interesting. Meanwhile the concept of the multiverse, while ever-intriguing, was poorly executed and did not draw you in at all.

The acting was passable, overall. Cumberbatch and Olsen were fairly good as always, but nothing groundbreaking here. The real story is how absolutely atrocious a job was done with America Chavez. It is unclear as to whether it is the fault of the actress: Xochitl Gomez, the writing team, or a combination of both, but this character was poorly executed from start to finish. America Chavez had the opportunity to be a very cool and interesting character in the MCU but they absolutely botched this introduction. Here's hoping they either kill her off quickly or do a better job with her next time around.

As mentioned, the one saving grace of the film was the animation and cinematography. As is the norm with marvel, this was executed near flawlessly and the film was very visually appealing. Bright colours and imaginative sets made the film a lot more enjoyable than it would have been. Again I'll mention my one caveat here is the constant use of satanic imagery throughout the film. When dealing with magic and witchcraft, it is to be expected that some satanic imagery would arise, but an overuse of this sort of thing creates over saturation and takes away from the overall quality of the film.

All in, I'm giving this a 3, verging on a 4 because of the great visuals and always enjoyable Cumberbatch and Olsen. The story was truly awful, and, recency bias acknowledged, I currently feel that this is the worst MCU film to date."
Sadden they turned this movie into this.,We were so excited to watch the movie but ended up leaving half way through. The amount of gore and demonic material they had in the movie was such a let down. This is by far the most let down we have been over any marvel movie this far. I hope they can turn the next movie around if not we will not be watching it. We truly love the marvel movies but this one was such a let down.
"Excitment, balance, lots of great moments!","The movie has a great mix of intense scenes with some twists and turns together with some good quiet moments where you can just relax and enjoy the beautiful visuals. This is a balance I truly wish more action-movies could have. Absolutely loved the original trick towards the end part. To make the movie experience even better, watch WandaVision first!"
Don't waste your 1000 bucks on this movie,"Storyline is kind of absurd. Don't waste your money to make marvel rich. Wait for it to screen on OTT or wait for the price to come down to 300 bucks.

Overrated and disappointing movie."
Could have been better.,"Movie is quite above average, but could have been way better than this if it was a bit longer. It starts up slow but with time gets rushed that at the end you fill like you are not full and wants more of it, but its over already."
Great movie but could've been much greater,
Worry about kids,
Disappointment,"Non-spoiler part-

We all were curious about how the MCU was going to live up to the expectations we had after the Spiderman NWH. With the perfect cameos of our favourite superheroes it showed us the glimpse of the future of MCU and we all were like how can u make something bigger than that and then we get the trailer of Doctor strange MoM. With the rumours of biggest superstars making comebacks and joining the MCU, we were quite sure that this movie will be equally good as NWH if not better and there we went wrong.

I personally liked the movie but am disappointed like most of the people just because of the huge expectations I had with the movie so I think we will really enjoy this movie if we watch it again sometime later because then we will be seeing it as Doctor strange 2 instead of the Competition of Spiderman NWH.

Spoiler part-

I am trying to list out the parts where I got disappointed.

1- Comeos We were expecting to see Loki , Deadpool, Ironman, Kang and many others but didn't get to see any of them.

And characters that actually showed up were the part of so called Illuminati and I believe they were the most useless characters in entire MCU. They could not lay off even a single good punch on Wanda and we're expected to believe that a team which has a captain Marvel as it's members were beaten up by a single being within 10 minutes. And I am still trying to figure out why did they have Reed Regards in the movie as he looked so pathetic in that scene. It was just an insult to those characters.

2-Doctor strange's power- I can't believe that I paid to see doctor strange running from Wanda for his life throughout the movie.

Most of us were really excited to see the power of sinister strange as we loved him in what if? But what we get to see is the same doctor strange who was hiding from Wanda in entire movie beats the sinister strange without breaking a sweat.

3-Movie duration- I lost half of the interest in the movie the day I found out that this is just 2 hrs movie. It was very impossible to give good role to characters making cameos in such short duration and that's what exactly happened."
Dr Strange and the multiverse of cringe,"A marvel movie with gore? What? Are we in another universe?

With some steps into the horror categorie and a script that looks more like a comic than a fil. This time is nothing like you ever saw in the franchise.

If that is better or worse it's the decision of the viewer and I couldn't judge this movie on that (even if I'm more of the second opinion... )

What I can judge is that the voice actress that learned spanish the day before the audition was not a good choice to interpret the spanish protagonist. (I saw the movie in France)

That if they finally show lesbian characters in marvel movies they should show of them something more about their characters than the fact that they are lesbians.

Or that the ending felt forced.

Obviously I can't deny that the visual part was amazing, the acting perfect and knowing more about our heros/villains was very entertaining. But as a friend of mine told me, maybe they did too much."
Olsen CARRIEd the movie,"I wouldn't even have bothered had Wanda not been in the movie to be fair.

A bit underwhelmed by the third act after a strong start and build up though.

Also, harassing film execs with fan casting works!"
What an utter disappointment,"I never felt that ""sad"" after watching a movie. Yes, that's how much of disappointment I felt at the end. I literally waited months for this and jumped right on it once it was released. But man, that ain't no Doctor Strange movie whatsoever.

If you are like me and loved the first one so much, expect anything far from that in every aspect. I don't even know when Dr Strange was supposed to be a horror movie?

The first movie had a magical blend of fantasy, character development, wit, humor and action. I never liked a superhero movie that much. But this. This is brutally bad.

Just remove Strange's scenes already and name it Wanda's Fallout (like literally, her character is destroyed after years of development). His scenes were too insignificant anyways."
Not sure when it was made but definitely not 2022,
lower than average,"Is it horror movie or what, if someone made this without marvel characters score would be only 5 and also we need to talk about awfull effects Idk what they call CGI or what, its just pathetic."
"This wasn't the Multi-Verse of Madness, it was Wanda/Vision Season 2..",
Not Doctor But Dissapointed STRANGE !!!,
Why Marvel!?! Why?!?,"The movie starts out good and the Multiverse is introduced really nice, but the last hour of the movie is maybe the worst 60 minutes in Marvel history."
"I loved the movie and the effects were so amazing, but I was expecting more than this, because it's short and fast, and I expected that more than five characters would appear","I loved the movie and the effects were so amazing, but I was expecting more than this, because it's short and fast,and I expected that more than five characters would appear."
"Not quite the film I was hoping for, but still an entertaining watch",
A Different Marvel Universe,
"Weard, and bad, and weard. Just special effects",
Worst marvel movie ever,"Seems like watching evil dead back. Did very bad job saimi. Don't direct any marvel movies in the future.

I couldn't feel like I was watching a Marvel movie. It was quite hilarious just like evil dead."
Disappointed big time,
Not as expected,"Marvel said there will be lot of surprises but there is no any, only those who were at the trailer .

Don't expect any surprise so u won't be disappointed like me. The movie is still very good tho and I recommend to watch of course."
have you heard about fancy trash ?,"Have you heard about fancy trash ? Well , this is exactly it , very expensive marvel movie with a ridiculous script and so much unnecessary things , this is first class fancy garbage."
"The MCU just gets sludgier and sludgier. Thanks, Feige","Great performances, exhilaratingly detailed visuals very akin to the source material, bold story concepts and a distinct directorial style that weaves a new kind of Marvel experience. One of intensity, mysticism and horror!

Unfortunately, it suffers from much of the cataclysmically confusing and infinitely inconsistent world-building present in much MCU content nowadays. Dialogue is needlessly peppered with juvenile, insipid jokes that muddy the drama or stakes of the story and characters, the protagonist is an unusual far cry from his pre-established level of intellect and resourcefulness he previously demonstrated, the main villain is bafflingly unlikable and ham-fisted in execution, the established forces of good in this series are bizarrely absent despite this being the highest possible stakes set in the Marvel movies on record, scenes of calmness and natural assessment for characters to better connect them with the audience are missing in favor of big action spectacles, intense verbal confrontations or the same cookie cutter gags eminating the stench of a first draft. And above all else, it leaves a disheartening impression of having to juggle many themes and internal narratives at once while failing to satisfyingly conclude any of them

Certainly not a movie I would recommend to comic book fans, action cinema fans or really anybody who desires anything more than a colorful computer generated explosion or a well-known actor proficiently delivering a poorly written jest at the expense of any serious investment in this story. Unmemorable mediocrity."
Losing interest in MCU,This movie contains nothing of what made the phase one movies interesting. A decent storyline. CGI effects in which made up far too much of the screen time. By the time the movie was 3/4 of the way done we couldn't wait to get out of there. Lost interest by that point.
It felt rushed,"I really enjoy the movie, but fights scenes felt rushed, especially the Illuminati scenes. They can be more intriguing and challenging, but director chose the easy way."
Loved it,Watched this movie with family and I can tell you everyone loved this classic. Must watch for everyone. Waiting for sequel I rate this classic 9 out 10 Jean claude reuille.
VERY RANDOM,
Dont watch it in theatres even if you are rich,"I was too excited about dr strange i love the character and after no way home my expectations was too high.

Multiverse is a great concept i would love to watch movie on it and here i got chance to watch it through multiverse madness.

I went to watch the movie the good part in the movie is their visual otherwise no storyline , no good action sequence except one where wanda killed some heroes the best part of movie is already shown in trailers it is not a movie just an extended trailer.

It is not multiverse madness but a sadness after you watch the movie you will regret it why i waste my precious money and time.

Marvel again looting people and fooling 1 good movie now impounding our hard earned money.

Please try to save yourself from the movie.

Invest those money in shares better than watching it in theatres.

End credits are pathetic,absurd totally scamming."
Expectations were high and didn't dissapoint!,
Is it a good movie?,
Not enough multivers and bad ending.,"Honestly the only thing I loved in this movie is wanda, but the rest was weird specially the way how the movie ended. I'm not sure if I will be a fan of the msu longer, I just hope Thor love and thunder does well."
Movie needs to be renamed Wanda Vision,
too much to tell but too boring to hear,
visual treat but not mat with expectations,"It's a Wanda Vision Finale more than a Doctor Strange movie MCU is becoming M She U just watch for visuals not worth the hype of multiverse,but its different from other marvel films."
Lmfao what did I just see,Really just wish I can travel to a alternate universe where I didn't see this movie. Take me back to the time when I didn't see this. I was more captivated by trying the different slushee flavors my local cinema offers than trying to follow this confusing and poorly written plot.
I liked the movie very much i only wished to be a little bit longer so the storyline no been rushed,I liked the movie very much i only wished to be a little bit longer so the storyline no been rushed. Beautiful executed with some awesome and brutal elements.

Was very dark and demonic,Was dissapointed to see that Marvels changed. Used to be semi-family friendly but not anymore. It also had a lack of a storyline and was kinda boring.
Third class plotting,"Very cheap story nothing amazing Marvel standard now maybe not upto mark these days. Simple thoughts not a good script or writing, may in future thry good work. Film by film they downgraded wow effects.may good work in future ."
Madnesss Alll Around....,Movie Stands True To It's title .... There's Madness All Around In The Movie From the word go.... IMO It's Darkest Movie To Come Out Of MCU.... The Movie Is Poised With Spectacular Visuals... Vfx team Did a Great Job...
Haters gonna hate,"Being a DC fan I was so disappointed with this year's batman, however multiverse of madness truly exceeded my already high expectations. Yet its shocking how this one gets a lower rating than batman.

Watch this if you got a brain and have the context for all you need to know before this movie. I did hear that Raimi's original cut was way longer but honestly didn't felt it was too rushed or had loopholes.

Great soundtrack, visuals and some horror. Again you wouldn't be disappointed unless you crave medicore things like "" The Batman"""
Non spoiler overview,"Let's start with the cons of the film; I believe that it should have been 30 mins longer so that the scenes could breathe a little more and that there is more of an emotional connection in the film. The pros; I love how this feels like a Sam rami film, it's camp horror and editing style works beautifully and I think this will decide audiences based on there preference, however it's still a very good but not one of the best films you will ever see."
"They tried TOO hard, and they failed...","This was supposed to be a horror movie, but it played more like a Disney princess story. I wanted to like it sooo much, but I hated it. Everything felt forced and the CGI was mostly laughable. I'm happy I didn't pay to see this in theaters."
Sad that Dr Strange was too weak to be the hero in his own movie.,
THE MULTIVERSE OF MAD,
Gets 6 for the special effects,"The plot itself is messy and very rushed in itself. Doesn't have the ""magic"" feeling the first one had. Kinda feels like a B-movie with high budget and not on purpose."
Universe of random nonsenses,I don't understand how can somebody create film like this... It ruined the meaning of MCU and its history... I don't remember when I was so dissapointed with film in cinema...
So good,It is so good.ii jogging officiunofficial hu hi hormones HTH 8th uucp in hu hi u go up him muffinally. Highish guys obit I ho go bo jj Kyi hi HTH bud good up huff hi hi hu 87888.
I like it!,"Not perfect because of some plotholes and a few cliches but very very entertaining. I liked it a lot. Definitely a different type of marvel which is pretty awesome.

Great jump facto to in some scenes."
BEST. MOVIE. EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
Misleading,
It's basically the Marvel version of the first season of Fringe,"This movie isn't bad. It had some great parts and it had some parts that made me scratch my head. I've recently started the show Fringe again, and it's eerie how similar it is. I think most will like this, but it's not amazing. I think some of it is how they (mcu) lead us to believe that this movie would be very different than what it was and the expectations made us think it would have something to do with the last Spider-Man movie, or who the villain would be."
This is not that what we want,
Seems like watching a Bollywood movie 😂,"It is unbelievable that this movie still have a rating over 7. The weak storyline, worst CGI and visual effects, lack of expressons from the actors doesn't even up to the mark. Specially the character built by wanda maximoff is pretty weak. Not even the evil can turn himself into a destructive materials for this weak reason lol. Wasted my time on it."
Great if you've watched the rest and don't have overhyped expectations,"Let's set it straight, this movie is fantastic in its direction (Sam rami you smashed it) and the story, acting and pacing is amazing. To me it seems like two sides of hate which is clashing in the reviews.

The first side is those who haven't watched the other content (like wandavison) and so don't fully understand the reasoning behind character motivations, actions and beliefs. Without the background history I understand the movie might seem confusing.

The second is those who heard the word 'multiverse' and imagined that meant that Hagrid was going to come aboard the millennium falcon to fight golem for the ring to save kings landing from Donald trump. Like chill out. I feel like the cameos were enough to feel fresh and surprising but not too much that it detracted from the story.

If you read this and feel like you are one of those above, fair enough, you probably won't like this. But otherwise, it's a great film, with a great story, amazing visuals and direction and a heartfelt story that does justice to its characters."
"Definitely a lot of Madness, and we're here for it","Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a fantastic film. The visuals are incredible, the plot it remarkable and the horror aspects bring something new to the MCU. Multiverse of Madness is the darkest Marvel movie so far and that makes the story even better than it already is. The acting is also one of the best parts of the movie, because watching MoM, I felt the characters's emotions.

Even though I really loved this movie and I thought it was amazing, something was missing. The ending wasn't as awesome as it should've been. As we've seen, Marvel movies always have an epic ending and I'm not saying this one didn't, but it deserved so much more!

Overall, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a visually pleasing film with great actors and an amazing storyline, just wish that the ending would've been better."
Hopefully this will improve on second and third viewing,
Major plot hole...which mom was her real mom?,"I'm sure there's a irrational explanation, but I'm too busy trying to digest this absolute trash of a movie. Bravo Disney, try hiring a production crew that doesn't take acid before writing the script."
Wanda maximoff,I love Wanda maximoff I hope we can see her become a hero in the next movie. Please don't make her old In the next film after doctor strange in the multiverse of madness.
Wanda maximoff,
The movie,
The movie,
Actually pretty bad.,"Every once in a while the Marvel franchise throws out some outrageously funny movie where you can look past all the plot holes because it's a bit of a laugh but DSMVM was not this and was presented as a serious action adventure.

I think the biggest problem is that the Marvel universes no longer have any rules that the universes have to adhere to. This is a collection of universes where you have Tony Stark and Groot, and witches, and zombies... you literally have aliens and zombies. This is poorly explained as earth 616 + others. Because anything and everything is now possible there is no longer any meaning, it's not madness, it's nonsense."
Amazing!!!,"Where To Start 😜 This Movie Has Everything From Horror to Very Dark and Must Say this is The Most entertaining Marvel Movie To Date!!! I Laughed, i Jumped And Must Say Danny Elfman Score is Amazing 🤘💪 Congratulations Sam Raimi for a Job Well Done 😎🤘 Hoping for Another Raimi Directed Nr 3."
One of my favourite MCU movie,"I really enjoyed the movie, it was more ""horror"" than I expected but in a good way! You can clearly see the hand of Sam Raimi.

Even if the plot sure has some weaknesses, the movie is definitely enjoyable and (finally) a bit different from the classic marvel formula!"
This a preschool movie,"This movie is a joke ,it is not worth my money or my item that I spent on it 😑 I'm so disappointed.

I didn't expect this at all ,the story itself isn't satisfying neither enjoyable to watch ,maybe others will like it but this is my opinion and I'll never change it whatsoever."
Worth watching on the big screen,"I don't usually go to the cinemas but i try to make an exception for MCU movies. And this one deserves a big screen viewing. MCU stepping into the genre of horror is something fresh. In addition, all those gore (although at the expense of some great characters) is an indication that MCU is ready for deadpool."
Horrible movie!,
Malayalam movie Anadabadram copy,"Seems like Malayalam movie Anadabadram copy, Wanda = Manoj k jayan. Most of the mo vaa ir Wanda reminds me of manoj k jayam. Overall good movie. Wanda overpowered. Could have been better story line."
Don't trust doctors,"Doctor strange started out as a regular doctor you see, performing surgeries and what not then BAM, he gets into a car accident and lose his precious little fingers he starts crying and skip a few scenes he becomes a sorcerer that can do strange things, and you might think ""Well this is a marvel movie there should be a hero to this story."" very false. He became known as Dr. Crack he used his special powers to come up with the best coccaine known to the universe and here's where I come into the story. I'm a regular guy minding my business and I hear noises coming from an alley way right, and there I see a computer that has roblox on it, I didn't think much of it so I instantly logged into my account and played a game, unbeknownst to me Dr. Crack is also playing the same game, I'm minding my own business and then I see Dr. Crack doing what he does best (selling crack) so I walk up to his little stand and I have a full 5 stars in my hand and I say ""do you have any of the good stuff?"" Dr. Crack then nods yes, so I give him my VERY expensive 5 stars for some crack, but lookey here, this little marvel ""hero"" scams me and I throw a tantrum, I throw every insult I can to that man and then he just boots out the game, and I'm sitting here questioning my decisions, questioning life itself, and then it hit me, I'm gonna review bomb every one of his movies so he gives me my rightful 0.4 grams of crack he promised. End of the story, thank you for coming to my Ted talk.."
solid,"Short review: It is definitely not the best marvel movie at all but I would say it is made solid. I like to see Benedict Cumberbatch in his role, the story was okay and some funny scenes were in it.

Important: you have to see the new Spider-Man movie, the first Dr Strange movie and also all of the Avengers movies to understand everything in this movie.

Nowadays I often notice that the film industry puts the main focus on visual effects and not on a brilliant story. This is a great pity. The best movies were made between the 90s - 2010 (more or less) and there the effects were nowhere near as good as today. Still, the movies were a lot better. It doesn't always have to be more bombastic, more twisted, etc. The story counts!"
Good but not Great,
Fantasticcccc,"Truly a mind bending vision brought to us by sam raimi. The way he has created this immersive and indulging, heart thumping, With goosebumpy feeling movie at every instance is just out of this world."
Not top of Marvel list,
Doctor Strange: MOM,"Doctor Strange: MOM.

This film really has fantastic visual effects. The story is very good too, because it has got touching elements of family and love. The story also contains many surprises, and a few laughs too. I enjoyed this captivating journey right from the beginning to the end."
Huge disappointment compared to the first movie.,"The first Dr. Strange movie was a serious work with great and intelligent ideas behind the storyline. It was a smart drama about the transformation of egocentric personality into altruistic character through spirituality.

What can I say about the 2nd movie?

Actually, nothing to talk about apart from amazing visual effects.

Unfortunately, there are significant gaps in logic and motivation of characters, silly dialogs and the movie seems to be a number of bright but disjoined scenes.

The only thing one can learn from that ""masterpiece"" is: Whenever you want to do anything (even to buy a candy) you should use black magic..."
ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF 2022,
Rambling Raimi,"Save yourself the 2 hours and the cost of admission and read the spoilers later. Despite the runtime over 2 hours, the movie feels rushed from the outset. I was able to tolerate that until the campy, cringy, C-list horror movie vibe dragged the film beyond the limits of reason into heinous nonsense. Marvel really whiffed on this one."
Horrible,"This movie was so disappointing after loving the first Doctor Strange. Poor acting overall, the heavy use of green screen must have really affected the cast this time around. The writing was cheesy, poorly executed cliches, entirely predictable and lacked any sense of pacing.

Blatant use of exposition throughout the entirety of the movie, literally stating the theme at the end. Not to mention the plethora of plot holes. The scientist who created the secure observation chamber then tries to break it with a fire extinguisher?

One of the main plot devices (Dreamwalking?) entirely defeats the pursuit the antagonist has because it is essentially the same ability that they are chasing America Chavez (cringey name) for.

This is an abomination of a movie and I wish I could have those 2+ hours of my life back. I started laughing at the serious moments of this movie because it felt like a parody of itself.

""Is America okay?"" - not after seeing this movie.

Avoid at all costs."
"Troubled, and not flawless, but at the very least a fine film",
Stop setting up the next film and do justice to the current one.,Seems that all marvel are doing is always setting up the next film and the next film instead of doing justice to the current film. Great acting but story was weak and direction was weak.
Green screen - the movie.,"The real question is.... Is this a live action movie or a CGI/Animation movie with real actors with some CGI alterations on top? Is there a limit/rule for not having a single real set in a ""live action"" movie? Maybe it is just me getting old and missing the balance that made movies immersive and relatable, even if the plot is totally fictional..."
Not enough doctor strange,
fantastic movie!,"I truly enjoyed the entire movie from front to back. This was one F-word away from being R and a little scary.

Because of the actions of Loki, the Multiverse is WIDE open and there is now endless possibilities to bring previous characters back! No matter what movie they starred it.

I'm rating this an 9. This was more WandaVision 2 (without Vision) but too good to not see it 3 more times. The Captain Carter character was awful and the fight scene with her was dull."
Multiverse scenes,"You can enjoy multiverse concept in this movie. Although I enjoyed it, but it can be more interesting ad we all know Marvel for this. Though it's a pretty good movie to enjoy."
Barely any multiverse,
A disappointment.,"This film was just underwhelming. The acting was decent, but the production value and directing were just abhorrent. From painful cuts to even more painful cheesy dialogue. The attempt to combine various movie genres simply failed, instead of making a movie with a concrete structure, the director made an abomination. I enjoyed the first Dr Strange film and it deserved its high rating. The film I watched today is a significant downgrade which deserves a rating not higher than 6.5/10."
"Sam Raimi is, once again, out of his depth.",
Illuminati,"I will like to tell the world, MY TESTIMONY, I want to quickly let you know how my life changed from Grass to Grace. Armstrong Philips is my name and I live in New Mexico City USA.

Great movie enjoy and wow,"I like doctor strange Very excited for the part 2, i booked ticket for first day in my country It what I expected for a movie , no boring, good view, funny, messy , ... mixed in best way.

Except i dont feel much about the America. She must be more special with her role.

I impressed with the scene that doctor strange use evil soul to become his cloak."
Send the MCU into the Disney Vault for 20 some years... please,"Superhero Fatigue, if you weren't getting already you will have it now. A convoluted plot with story beats ripped straight from The Hex of ""WandaVission"" that spends most of the film telling you they don't care about any of the characters you love and ignoring most of the set up other MCU films were supposedly creating for this 2+ hours of uncharacteristic gore. With cameos that feel more like Disney bragging to you about all the IP they own now."
"Not worth the hype, but pretty enjoyable.",
Another hit from Marvel,"Wow, this movie is actually better than No Way Home, and exceeded my expectations in every way. Not a boring moment and it was an amazing journey. Both Wanda and Strange were great in the movie and well acted too."
Don't live upto expectations,
Doctor doctor who is there,"Finished watching the Dr strange in the multiuniverse of madness. The film itself would definitely be a movie that all Marvels' fans would be interested to watch, however as have mentioned in the name of the movie itself ""madness"" at some point the animations and storylines are confusing. It has turned the movie into partially horror and too realistic. To compare with the first dr strange movie, this one is a bit out of our minds and our imagination."
Let me tell u my point of view.,This was such a boring movie. The MSU has done an amazing job with their movies. Although this was not it. 2 hours was not long enough for all these happening. The first hour i was ready to stop the movie and just sleep. Also in the last 10 minutes everything happened so fast that we could not understand them. Hopefully this won't happen again! Sorry MSU :(
Not what you're expecting...,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a tough one to try and review.

I think that comes down to this is something completely new for Marvel, it's very dark, it's very close to a full blown horror film, it's full of things you would never have expected and it's incredibly fast paced. It also comes down to some clever marketing from Disney leading many fans down a path prior to the film and then in the cinema the experience is something entirely different from what was originally expected.

It's a new genre of film for the MCU, at points this feels like a genuine horror film, it's gory, it's dark, it's gothic and at point there's genuinely good and frightening jump scares. A lot of people are saying it's not suitable for kids, but I would imagine most teens would be fine watching this. It's still a superhero film after all and although dark at points it still follows a superhero trying to do the right thing.

It's fast paced from the off set, from the opening scene of the film until the finale this movie is off to the races at 100mph and doesn't hit the brake pedal until the after credit scenes. That's not a criticism, and unlike Episode 6 of Moon Knight, this film doesn't feel excessively rushed or that it could do with another half an hour added to the run time, it's just fast throughout, but I think that plays into its title and it's aim of being a bit mad and crazy.

Lastly, I've watch so many predictions on this film from critics and film and comic book fans and had many a discussion with my friends and partner on how this film is going to go down. Nobody I've spoken to or seen even came close to predicting this films plot. There's certainly things in the film that are to be expected but the overarching plot is one of madness and darkness but sets up a new aspect of the MCU well going forward.

I think this film has been massively hyped up, No Way Home was hugely successful and despite Disney have a part to play in that, it's ultimately a Sony owned property and Disney wanted to hit back with a blockbuster of their own that brought in huge box office numbers. Because of this I was expecting a barrage of cameos and moments only wedged into the film for fan service and this film isn't that, and I think it would have disappointed many if it was that. There are cameos, there are surprises but they make sense and they're done well. There is fan service too, but again it's done tastefully.

Disney and Marvel's clever marketing has made us all expect a film of cameos and fan service but actually the film they've given us, isn't what we were expecting at all, it's a film filled with unpredictable madness."
Amazing but not exactly what was in mind,
Mind-blowing,"This one is full of awesome and more creative visual effect scenes than the previous one. And just so we know that the director, Sam Raimi, he had made one hell of an ultimately scary movie back in 1980s. So it is predictable that he will be using his old-horror method from Evil Dead sequels :D.

On the other hand, the fighting scenes are not as cool as I thought they would be. Much better when he directed the Trilogy Tobey Spider-man.

What makes this movie is so mind-blowing is that there are so many surprising elements which we haven't seen before in any previous MCU movies. Too many confusing theories regarding to Multiverse Concepts."
Meh,
Ideology for no reason,"I would have given it a strong 5, if it had not been the leftist thread of two lesbian mothers, which was forced and unnecessarily added to the script and completely meaningless and irrelevant to the story ... it is a pity that marvel is also involved in pushing the toxic ideology into heads of young people ..."
"Great acting, so-so composition","Acting was great and no problem with casting. Superhero was kind of cool. Innovative in that it tried to take some new elements but it wasn't really new a - just a remix of formulas that felt contrived. And so I didn't care very much about the characters. There is a superhero who seems like he could be cool but I am not invested. We can do better. Stellar acting, I blame writing team mainly. Probably trying too hard to make this do too much, for too many audiences, without offending anybody. The new formula, so boring."
"In case you were wondering, it's definitely a stinker","What's that smell? Oh, it's this movie.

Just remember, lots of people got paid a lot of money for this production, but no one deserves more credit than the editors who digitally removed green screen reflections from people's eyes and every single damn frame of this film. No wonder my local Joann's was out of green fabric. Also, literally any Disney Channel original movie from the 2000's has less cheesier lines."
"Was really good, but wasn't what I expected",Score is mostly due to Wanda
Disappointing,"Worst comic book movie of the year. Yeah worse than Morbius. I don't believe that my favourite comic book movie director Sam Raimi did this movie. Probably Kevin Feige directed it with Raimi's name in it. It feels rushed, unnecessary cameos, cheesy dialogue,weird camera movements, very bad cgi. I can't think of anything good about this movie. Not worth your time."
Please hire someone who actually know comics,
Wanda supremacy,
want expecting much and i got it,"One star is too much the effect were decent, but that should be a given.

My sons loved it they couldn't say why but they did.

Scorsese said MCU is not cinema its like a theme park this was the teacups. With a side show of adding some marvel character previously lost to other production company's.

Elizbeth Olsen is a terrible actress how she got co lead is beyond me.

Very dark movie also be wary of taking younger children the 12a rating is a bit of a stretch, it get bums in seats."
It was fire,Movie absolutely bangs lots of surprises that weren't revealed through the trailers ! Also some of these scenes and action sequences are absolutely awesome and gruesome.
Amazing!!,
A long slog of bore,Not even Bruce Campbell could save this film. I legit checked my watch 6 times in the first 40 minutes. Long boring and this is coming from a guy who can binge LOTR in a single weekend. I wanted to get my money back before the first hour and I didn't even pay for the tickets. I even regret wasting the energy required to post this review. Just don't see it sober.
"think the movie was kinda short, I felt like I was waiting for something. But overall it was good.","Benedict Cumberbatch was good.

I'm curious why didn't they let Raimi make the movie longer. The movie overall was nice, but not the best. I think Spiderman no way home was better. New marvel movies are nice."
Not a good movie actually,
6.5 stars for frustratingly wasted potential,"I had high hopes for this movie, and was left underwhelmed and disappointed. It wasn't terrible, but it is very obvious that 40+ minutes of the film has ended up on the cutting room floor. The awesome first trailer was better than the final film.

I love multiverse and time travel storylines, and the cameos could have been great. But the great potential of this film, its actors, its story and its concept just doesn't come to fruition.

It all just feels rushed and incomplete. I love Wanda and Dr Strange as characters, but I didn't buy Wanda's motivations or characterisation (following straight on from the events of the WandaVision series) at all. Don't get me wrong: Elizabeth Olsen did an amazing job with what she was given! What Wanda wanted made sense, of course, but the way she went about it (and what she did in attempting to achieve that goal) was completely out of character, and made no sense for a character with her intelligence.

I'd love to see a cut of this film with the missing 40 minutes put back in, as it may make more sense. Because the film in its current state is frustrating in how much potential it had."
They named this movie wrong,
Wow!,"Ok I had high expectations for this movie and it wasn't good. The movie had a lot of visual effects which I'm sure people will love, but it was just too kiddish. The script of this movie was super basic and it was just a basic disneyfied movie to keep a child entertained. I really feel like marvel is getting away from its roots. Just so stupid!"
I guess it's time to grow up,"Had I not gone in to watch a marvel movie, I would say, ""eh, it was pretty good."" However, as an installment to the marvel cinematic universe-this movie will be the film that killed the magic for me.

Cutting out the most unnecessarily gruesome or more so just downright upsetting scenes, this movie would make for a decent continuation of the universe. With those scenes, this movie does not belong in marvel.

It is very weak reasoning to say the fan base is maturing and thus the movies shall also. The magic in these movies for many, myself included, was starting them with your dad or maybe an older sibling, but nonetheless being guided into a breathtaking universe at a young age. The future of marvel is not something I will ever show my kids.

The death scenes in this movie are appalling at the least. Not to mention the entire sequence that contains the most disturbing deaths is a complete copy and paste from a popular Amazon Prime IP.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Mutilation is the exact thing the world could really go without now and forever more. Perhaps I'm just aging out of the magic that marvel once enticed me with.

It was fun while it lasted."
Marvellous,
I feel there was room for an even better outcome..,
"Good, but could be better",
When trumpet-loving conservatives write movie scripts,Ooof what a waste of time and talent. This was a return to the terrible 90s hero movies. Horrible writing from start to finish. Maybe they should drop the Strange films all together if this is what we're in for.
Week storyline but best VFX and surprise of Horror,"The storyline is quite weak but watches VFX, cinematography and Direction. Horror is going to be new cool in Marvel Cinematic Universe. And don't forget to watch credentials till the end."
More as a stepping stone into future of madnesses.........,"Before watching Madness of Multiverse, you have to watch ""wanda vision"" series and ""What if... episode 4"". Without the idea of ""scarlet witch"" and what she is capable of, what drives Wanda to madness, what she cherishes most, her regret, We cant completly get the madness of multiverse. Endgame has hyped our expectation from MCU. Visuals were marvellous but I found that feeling, that energy missing here at the surface. But lets not forget Avengers characters had developed in cinematic universe since a long time. I wish role of Captain Carter, Ms Marvel, Charles Xavier of alternate universe could had some more depth. Through glimpses of alternate universe's Doctor Strange, we get very important lesson that it is not life that decides what you become, rather it is your choices, even the small ones that decide what you will become. Giving this 8 star, because we always expect somewhat better from MCU. Worth watching ...."
fancy game-like CGI and bad script.,
Movie is good but cameo is bad,
Suits it's rating.,"This movie was not bad at all. But it does not suit its name, this isn't a Dr Strange movie. This is a ""Scarlet Witch"" movie. Seeing one of my favourite superhero teams getting destroyed in seconds was very disappointing. I like Elizabeth Olsen's performance and Cumberbatch's. It might be way too cheesy for me but it's Raimi and I'll take it. Like the horror elements but somehow lacking in plot."
u should read this review,
"a paced movie with bad story but stunning visuals, a normal marvel movie",
"Sam Raimi delivers, but let down by weak dialogue and writing","The visuals were good and made the film interesting. The A-star cast acted well, with the highlight being Xochitl Gomez starring as America Chavez. Sam Raimi interweaves his directing style, with weird shots being the highlight. However Michael Waldron falls flat with his writing. The writing left multiple plot holes, the dialogue was simple and not very convincing, and the villains justification would confuse any casual Marvel fan."
1000 genres in one,There was a multiverse of genres and it was madness but still worth the wait!!!!! I think there is purpose behind why they did what they did. With MCU there is always more to these movies.
It is a grain for bigger tree in the future,"A fun ride,i wish i could got more story content and it has more or equal content of wanda then strange.the 9 ""nine star"" rating is for visuals and acting of cast nice....!"
Victim of its own false marketing,
Morbius was better!,"As much as I love marvel , this movie just didn't do it for me.

Morbius being better is obviously a little exaggerated. But i overall enjoyed it more than doctor strange 2 ."
Not as expected,
Super bad,"No liked. Very fantastic, no good arguments, the sound is not the best, bad photographic.im so decepcioned. I do not recommend it. Now all marvel movies are not good."
It was fresh,
Jumped the shark...,"So... did the screenwriter (or writers, I can't remember) intentionally mean for the core characters to completely abandon their core motivations and beliefs or was the audience not supposed to notice? SMH."
Multiverse? No thanks,"I am wondering if Marvel knows people hate multiverse? Multiverse is a fraud to audience: with multiverse everything is possible, you don't need to take care of plot because it can change everytime, a dead hero can easily be alive in another universe or be evil or whatever.

Multiverse killed comics and now it is killing movies.

Anyway, if that's their decision..."
"More Like: DR STRANGE AND THE MULTIVERSE IF MADNESS, BLUNT HUMOUR, SENSELESS VIOLENCE AND GRATUITOUS BLOOD AND GORE.","WARNING-this is NOT like the origin MARVEL movies of this series!

The studio has almost completely deviated away from any FUN entertainment in this one.

Instead, they have embraced the dark, sledge hammer, shock value humour and shock/horror, ultimate gore cartoon entertainment that leaves nothing to the imagination and that seems to be becoming the trend now in their studios.

For those expecting MARVEL fun and adventure you can take your kids to, this is not a movie I would be happy to see, or recommend any person under 16 watching (15 to 18 is even concerning). Nor for those with depression or mental concerns. (I made the terrible mistake of taking my 18 year old autistic son with me and it took weeks to get his mind around it. Thankfully his general consensus was that he felt uncomfortable watching it and did not like it much.)

More forewarning would have been appreciated thanks MARVEL.

Actual acting was very dead pan and pretty emotionless considering what was happening. As if it were run of the mill everyday stuff. Even the usually brilliant Benedict Cumberbatch couldn't act his way out of seeming bored and dulled by it all.

And, if the actors were dulled by the darkness and violence of it, what does that mean for the audience who watch if this continues to be the direction MARVEL are taking their movies??

It is a sad reflection on this production when the best non violent enjoyment and comic relief came from a CGI cape! (The only reason why it got a star)

I ended this movie feeling quite mentally tired, saddened, stunned, depressed and somewhat confused and disorientated and very disappointed by it. Gone was the clever, adventurous, humorous and FUN (Mild violence and gore accepted) MARVEL stories that can be enjoyed by the greater general public and families. Something the general public of the world needs in these fairly dark (real world) times.

At least give us FAIR WARNING so our youth and children don't become traumatised by it or, perhaps worse, desensitised to it!

And leave the gratuitous violence, horror, gore and sledge hammer dark, blunt humour more to the direction and genre of ""The Boys"" to the minority GRUNGE ""Adult"" audience who are old enough to fully understand and accept it, and may even like it.

We didn't."
"Great special effects, middling plot","We've reached the point in the MCU where the comics are becoming more and more of a resource for what we're seeing on-screen. Not to say that's a bad thing; as many of the visuals are taken from them and they are both beautiful and visually dazzling.

As for the plot, there's a lot left to be desired. It doesn't feel so much as a multiverse movie but more of a Dr. Strange v.s. Wanda's Evil Twin movie. I was looking for an entertaining balance between plot and special effects (much like the first movie) and I got more on the SFX side. Have to say, overall it was enjoyable but I wouldn't watch it again."
SAM RAIMI SAMRAIMING,"If you expect Spiderman Raimi, then welcome back Evil Dead. Surely out of the common MCU, the flow is faster than an heartbeat and the newcomer do their jobs. Less visuals than Derrickson but the travel is leading you crazy. Not the best Cumberbatch but The newcomers don't disappoint."
Sam Raimi being Sam Raimi,
Real Madness for Wanda fans,
Wanda's Fury,The movies visuals are exceptional. If you get a chance to watch in IMAX it won't disappoint you. The movie was entertaining throughout. Wanda is on John wick mode. There is no place to hide and No superhero or god can withstand her fury. It's a first horror genre. Sam Raimi did a really good job. The time just ran out so quickly as strange travels multiverses. Really excited what the next movie has to offer going in this direction.
Typical example of too many specials effects and too little story.,"Let's start by saying I love Marvel, especially for the special effects and because there's always something going on on the movie screen.

In this film too much attention has been given to the visual effects and not enough attention to the storyline. I missed an introduction, a build-up and a plot.

I like to know why something happens in a movie, how characters develop and I kind of missed that. The special effects, however beautiful, unfortunately confused me even more.

Conclusion is that I expected a lot from this movie, but I have to conclude that there are better Marvel movies."
Not worth watching in a Theater. Wait for OTT relaease and save your money.,"The story is very mediocre. And the heavy VFX is only used to hide this fact. Didn't feel like I was watching a Marvel movie. There are also many plot holes that the director just didn't bother to fix, maybe he was too busy with the VFX team. Disappointed in Marvel after watching this movie.

Don't waste your money for a ticket. Wait for the OTT release."
What a mess!,"This movie is all over the place and failed to keep my interest. Sam R visuals gave the only entertainment value I could digest. After the intrigue of Loki I expected so much more from this movie.

Bummer...."
Dr Strange and the Multiverse of Meh,
What?,
Worst marvel/dc comics ever...,Just don't watch it .. looking to an empty wall for 2 hours is more fun.. Too much visual effects and NO story NO acting.. I wonder why an actor would like to be in such a horrible movie.. From great Superman 1/2/3 to this garbage .
"Incoherent story, flat characters.","Incoherent story, flat characters.

Second protagonist, though crucial storywise, is neither introduced, nor said anything about. Her role is running and screaming, thats it.

This movie is like horrible fanfiction."
It's all about expectations,"With Loki's ending, the What-If-Stories, the Wandavision story & the multiverse happening in Spiderman one could think or expect that Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness now kicks off the Multiverse story in a big way or at least hint more directly where the new big story arch might evolve into.

And this simply doesn't happen. Some tidbits to the left and right but nothing adding something substantial here.

And that's okay. Because the pure action fanfest and all those visuals create a speed from the beginning to the end which is very enjoyable.

It's simple und pure fun. Raimi's influence here is very welcome. Some scenes could even be coming out of The Boys.

So. Nothing spectacular but a very welcome flick to enjoy some MCU in the movies again."
Another MSHEU masterpiece,
Messy and a little boring,"Not sure what was that specific ""spark"" that was missing, maybe the characters and actors didn't fit in as I hoped or just the story itself was too messy. I hoped more of it and didn't enjoy."
Best Marvel movie so far...,"I watch Marvel movies casually. Usually, I wait for a few to pile up and watch them. So, I am no Marvel die-hard fan. Also, I am 43 years old. I'm just saying that for the readers to have a reference in which age group I belong and how much to trust me or not.

This movie started and I thought that it would be the usual superhero movie. In my mind, that means nothing special. Popcorn movie to pass the evening. And then the third act started. That was an amazing ride that screams Sam Raimi all the way through. I couldn't believe how he could make a recognizable stamp on a Marvel movie that made it amazing instead of average."
Superb. But a little too much Wanda,
Enjoyable but overwhelming,
MCU and Sam Raimi Deliver,
Waste of time and money,It's Totally waste of money and time it's totally Worst movie I ever seen in my life please be don't waste your money it's full of by marvel full of madnessssss.
This is a story about Strange after all,
Mediocre....,
"Visual spectacle, as expected from a Doctor Strange movie","We're deep in the cinematic universe and right now you won't understand the main plot points if you haven't watched WandaVision.

Sam Raimi returns to Marvel and you can see this is a very different movie from the others in the MCU because of his direction. It has more horror elements, jumpscares and the violence escalates in a way we haven't seen in any Marvel movie. The kill count is very high, and the way most of those kills happen is pushing the boundaries of a PG-13 rating.

The revelation of the villain was a pleasant surprise (and boy what a terrifying OP villain), I love when the antagonist shines more than the protagonist because of their motives and the lenghts they go to complete their objectives (like how Infitiny War was an Avengers movie, but Thanos stole the show).

But two movies dealing with the multiverse is showing us what Marvel is planning to rely heavily on fanservice to sustain the plot and, like No Way Home, this one has it's share of fanservice as a ""reward"" for those who watched all Disney+ shows (and other movies not related to the MCU).

I mentioned the ""reward"" above because, as a person wo haven't watched any Disney+ show other than WandaVision, the post-credit scene made no sense to me (and most of the audience, as I could tell).

I really hope Marvel does more movies like this, not every superhero movie needs to be jolly, full of jokes in the wrong moments and serious wounds that has no blood. Not a perfect movie, but Sam Raimi leaves his mark."
Disappointed,"This movie had so much potential. It was more just madness than multiverse. Most the time after a MCU movie I walk out of the theater blown away and super stoked about what they did in the movie and want to see it again, but not this time. I didn't feel fulfilled. I felt bored throughout the movie and it all seemed a bit rushed. How they resolved the movie wasn't the best either. I wish they had added an extra 30 min to explore more of the multiverse and put some more characters in it. Even if it was just a brief cameo or someone in the background of some of the multiverses. Either some other variations of some of our favorite characters, introduced some new ones, or even old original ones from the 2000's movies. That would have been amazing! I was super excited for this movie and all the things it could've done. The only true thing I was stoked about was about mid way through when a specific character appeared that wasn't spoiled in trailers and played by the actor the fans wanted. Other than that, I wish we got more. More characters, more multiverses, and more excitement."
The worst movie in the MCU by far!,"I don't usually write reviews, but it had to be said. It was horribly written and horribly executed. Spider-Man 3 was better than this! I hope that gives you a gauge for your worthiness of watching it."
Boring (apart from the 15 mins),
"The multiverse of 9 varients and wanda,",
Kept my expectation low and I am happy about that,"I don't need to say too much things about this film. I enjoyed it. There is a kind of horror scenes in it and it is cool, I think. I love Benedict's acting in general. The editing was... not spectacular but good enough."
Not up to expectation,"The movie did not provide me with the required level that I expected. The story is not creative and repetitive in one way or another. I couldn't even finish the movie. This is in addition to containing immoral incidents, according to my beliefs."
Forgettable,"The multiverse offers up so many possibilities, but there are no dinosaurs, no mind bending ideas, just Earth with more flowers, or Earth with the traffic lights reversed. Of course it was a CGI fest and this suspension of reality makes the viewer feel less from the supposed threats. Ultimately wish washy and forgettable."
My honest opinion about this Movie,"I thought it was a okay movie but it had its moments where it went trash apart from those moments it was pretty good but this is a movie you should wait to see at home on dvd or a streaming service not worth seeing in a cinema.

I rated it 5 stars because it was ok but not great It was a bit everywhere they should of focused more on the multiverse theory and less mish mash."
Something's missing,Visual stunning with nothing much left to say. Storyline is too flat and basic at a point I almost felt anxious by risking my health (against covid) just to see this movie on big screen. A bit of waste on the very good actors and a subject as explorable as the multiverse.
yeH,IT IS good to put a little bit of turn. However the madness is not as much as I expected but still best overall. The plot is chaotic and have their own action that give a little bit of fun to watch but overall its kinda mess like the title itself.
"Not terrible, but not great either!","I feel bad giving this such a poor score, as it was not terrible. However, if it reflects the direction Hollywood is taking with the garbage coming out lately, I need to be completely honest.

The storyline was weak. I won't give too much away, but the motive of the main villain was seriously unconvincing. The movie was perhaps 30 mins too long. If it's a masterpiece, I love a 2hr movie, but this was no masterpiece. It became boring 3/4 through and it couldn't keep my 9 and 14yr old boy's attention all the way through. They started to lose interest just after halfway. While we're on the subject of what I didn't like, why does every Hollywood movie feel the need to contain so much ""woke"" content? I'm a fairly progressive guy, but I'm really tired of having it constantly shoved down my throat in every movie, TV show and even sporting events! I won't go into any details to keep this review from having spoilers, but how did the movie about Dr Strange become more about other gender diverse characters? Is it because Dr Strange is a single white male who doesn't satisfy the narrative of the day? Honestly, I'm about to give up on Hollywood. I don't mind diversity and inclusion in movies, but it is getting ridiculous, where movies are not even about the main characters they're based on anymore.

Like I said, the movie is not terrible. It has great CGI and really good acting. However, it is far from great and definitely a movie I'll never watch again."
Worst movie I've had the displeasure to watch in a long time,"This might just be the worst Marvel movie to date. I've watched them all, most of them more than once, so it's kind of hard to express just how disapointed I am. Nothing in this movie makes any sense: there is absolutly no charecter building, old characters act simply based on plot convinience and new characters are either incredibly bland or completly irrelevant to the story. Most of the scenes don't even have a purpouse, it's just void entertainment.

Absolutly dreadful. A score of 3/10 is generous."
my expectations were toooo high,"Leaks ruined the film,the film should have been delayed to fix alot of things in it,no ironman,zombie wanda or tobey's spiderman the film is kinda boring the story is bad because it doesnt really show everything in correct order."
I am incredibly disappointed,
Omar shehadeh didn't like it plus fee homework math,
Should have been 2h 30m,We needed more of the multiverse and more cameos. But totally worth watching. One of the best marvel movie after 5 years (Avengers infinity war).....................................
Watchable,"Not a great movie, but if you have nothing else to watch then I guess it's fine. Sometimes felt like a parody of a marvel movie? That was kinda funny I guess."
Starting of multiverse,"I don't know, what wants people, what expected from movie..... I like it more , it was ossm incredible Marvel movie Something was missing I know but not a big matters."
The plot that IMDB has listed is all wrong!,
"Its mid, but its good mid",
It's a continuation of WandaVision,"If you don't like horrors, you probably won't like this movie. It's dark, twisted and has quite a few jump-scare scenes. It has a lot more violence then other Marvel movies and that where it didn't seem neccesary. This seemed like a try to make something more serious and dark from a Marvel movie, but instead of being smart, it just ended up being twisted and forced into being violent and intense. As of story and characters, it seemed more as story about Wanda then about dr. Strange, thus her character gets more development then his. It is also directly connected to WandaVision TV show and if you haven't seen it, you may find it harder to understand the story and Wanda's character. You may also want to see Loki TV show prior to this to get better understanding of Multiverse.

Overall, putting aside the personal preference of genres, it has a good concept, but it is very forced and lacking in development of main character."
The most DIFFERENT MCU movies,"All i can say is, i'm so exited and happy for this film, specially for Wanda Maximorf finally got the opportunity to have a big role and influence in MCU, same as the comic,, The jumpscare is enough, and the concept of multiverse is good enough to be represent to all audience,, And it can be expanded again and again for another MCU project,, Great job for Sam Raimi !!"
Easily the worst Marvel movie,"This movie was on par with Morbius (probably, I haven't seen it). Don't waste your money. If I saw this on Netflix I wouldn't watch it.

There were groups of people literally laughing out loud at the fight scenes. The target audience was elementary school kids. I would've rated it lower but Wanda is kinda hype."
Disappointing,"Very disappointing and didn't even end up finishing the movie. The new character is thrown in randomly at the start and there is no character building, so I couldn't care that people were trying to kill her. After the first Dr Strange, this was a bit let down."
Wokeness and chaos personified,"If you want LGBT culture shoved down your throat in every scene, as the lead character wears a pride flag on her American flag jacket and has ""two mom's"", then this for you. If you want to be caught in a mishmash of nutty storylines that jump so quickly from one to another with little or no connection, then this is for you. However, if you're tired of being treated like a stupid ""sheeple"" who blindly follows anything put in front of them by an entertainment industry that counts on believing you are a robot who can't think for yourself, then skip it. Better yet, skip Disney all together. They are digging their own grave."
Can't believe I paid to watch this!,"What a load of rubbish. I was expecting a film about Dr Strange but got a film about Wanda aka Scarlet Witch instead. That story has already been told in WandaVision. It didn't need to be rehashed. The animated episode of What If? Was a billion times better than this film because it was all about Stephen Strange and his many alternate selves, and him alone. Some of the acting was truly appalling and the dialogue laughable. Wooden characters that you honestly couldn't care less whether they lived or died, especially the character of America Chavez. Do yourselves a favour, save your money and watch it when it's on Disney+ if there really isn't anything else that you can find to put on instead. Or better still, watch an episode of Sherlock and see Benedict Cumberbatch at his fabulous best!"
From a disappointed Marvel fan...,"I'm not even sure if the movie is about Doctor Strange. There's no relation in genre between this movie and the first one. The director, Scott Derrickson, just a made a collage of Horror+Comedy+Drama+Teen +Zombie movies.

In the music...Danny Elfman just copied Danny Elfman.

And the scene after the credits is a complete lack of respect with the audience.

What happened Marvel ?"
Good not great,"The director obviously didn't see WandaVision nor Loki and maybe not even Spiderman NWH. As the storyline and characters is out of context for the MCU phase. Also, the fight scene with melody tunes was a joke, didn't show the thrilling of a fight between the Sorcerer Supreme and him(other)self, this type of fight is Mickey Mouse level not Sorcerer Supreme level. Overall, it was good, but not great, especially after all the over-promoting and over-rating. A bit disappointing."
"An enjoyable watch, but",
"It Was A Great Movie, Sam Raimi Fixed His Mistake",
Didn't like it that much,
Worst ever...only fan service,
this movie made a billion dollars?,"What a piece of crap...as bad as matrix resurrection. To much cgi and confusing plot......please do not make a dr strange 3.please no more of this torture and with a imdb rating of 7,you have to be kidding."
Eternals better,
Fentastic,"Let's explore multiverse with this movie and i know that wanda you'r how much capable off.

Let's explore multiverse with this movie and i know that wanda you'r how much capable off."
Honest Review,"VFX and Animation: If you are finding best VFX and animation movies, this is one of these. Your eyes won't take a moment from the screen.

Story: Storyline is average. You will enjoy whole movie, but don't feel. Your experience will be mind-blowing. This movie is like beautiful body but there is no heart in body. And heart is story.

Who should watch: From my side, you should not watch this movie in smart phone, if you are Marvel fan. But If you are not Marvel fan, you can skip this movie.

Plot and Ending: There is good plot. On one moment you will be have question in your mind, ""what will happen?"" (Only one moment!) Ending is normal and The normal term doesn't look good on Marvel. It could have been better.

Rating: This is my final statement. As a Marvel fan, I am giving 6 out of 10. And As a normal audience, I am giving 5 out of 10."
Wanda maximoff,
Disney does what it does best,"Absolute rubbish!! Disney have absolutely destroyed everything it puts it's hands on, have nothing else to say but this review has to contain at least 150 characters so ....................................................................................."
Goofs,
"After EndGame, MCU movies just like FanService",
nothing here,"First off I will say that I turned the movie off at the 30 minute mark as I did not want to waste anymore of my time. Up to this point the movie as near zero character development and is full of CGI. I fully enjoyed the first Doctor Strange which made me excited to see this but there is lack of substance, it was just as shallow mess of cheesy over the top CGI.. I want to see practical effects and deep (or at least _some_) character development. It is clear that Disney is taking Marvel in the wrong direction by replacing good writing with cheap effects; it looks like Marvel has finally lost their way in the film department. If you enjoy just a bunch of over the top plastic visuals and characters without character then go ahead and give this a go."
Madness,"Boring, lots of cgi but no substance. Watched and have already forgotten. My wife's favorite character is dr strange, and she agrees the movie was just bad."
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness' is an extraordinarily unique and fun film that dramatically differs from the usual concepts and themes from most average Marvel movies. It is a thrilling cinema experience with thrills around every corner. The acting was absolutely amazing, mainly Elizabeth Olsen made a surprisingly great antagonist that you can't almost feel sorry fro despite the vile acts she commits throughout the film as many long-time Marvel fans will see her fall from grace as she was mistreated and controlled her entire life. Benedict Cumberbatch was great as usual. Departed his character arc being pretty much done, his character development was pretty decent. The references, callbacks and cameos are fun to watch while not stealing the show or being too involved in the story. The spectacular visuals are applied appropriately for a unique visual exploration of the Marvel multiverse. The gore/horror element and jumpscares fit the theme of the movie well and many concepts are explored are explores both visually and emotionally. Depsote the moviehaving a short runtime, this psychological thriller is a fun watch and I recommend."
"Wtf did I just watch, The only redeeming quality of this movie was the beer in my hand.","Save yourself the time and go watch something else.

My biggest issues with this movie are: 1. Patrick Stewart really didn't need to appraise his role as Xavier. During the last Wolverine movie interview cycle he had said he was done with the character because he explored everything it had to offer, it should have stayed at that.

2. Disney, please stop throwing an LGBTQ agenda into everything.

3. The plot is long and shallow, what were the writers smoking."
Meh,"Could have been so much more, but instead it was all very one note without subtlety. There was humour, but with the exception of one great sequence toward the end it had all be done before. I wasn't blown away, but I didn't hate it, I was just left a bit disappointed because there was so much potential to do something great with this film and none of that was realised."
Trash movie. Kills all new Characters in 5 min of their introduction,
Dissapointment,"This had to be one of the best mcu moveis but he failed. Visual effects are great but plot,music,villian all things need to be better.this movei is only 50% of doctor strange in multiverse of maddnes."
"It is not what you expect it to be, and that's good.","For movies like this we usually say that what makes them good is that they don't take themselves too seriously (see Thor: Ragnarok or Guardians of the Galaxy), but what makes this one so, so delightful is that it is so refreshingly sincere. We are adults watching a movie about a reality bending wizard called Doctor Strange, we don't need to constantly be let in on the joke with irony and sarcastic jokes, we WANT it to be as absurd as it sounds.

Halfway through the movie I found myself smiling and that smile refused to go away. I too can point out flaws all day long, but I'm giving it a 10, if not for any other reason, but for the fact that it genuinely gave me joy."
It was fun but kinda disappointing considering all the hype,"-1 star because David Haller wasn't in the movie, another -1 because America Chavez deserved a better adaptation than this, and another -1 because no earth 3490 Stony cameo, and ANOTHER -1 because no Stephen/Wanda/Loki team up. But overall it was fun i guess."
What after this?,"The first thing I like about this movie when it's started is introducing characters, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness movie introduces characters professionally but introduces movie elements in a thin and weak way and it did not because of this it did not help the story to be more interesting, which are making me not feeling excited or curious about the next scene or it was very easy to expect the next scenes easily. The movie did not give me any chance to discover what is going on by myself. Too many expositions, too many expositions. Maybe because the story was not attractive enough for me.

The movie could use the universes to link them in the story. It was trying to satisficing me after nonsense scenes with crazy and interesting fight scenes, which make me move on to the fight scene, it was very good and I really enjoy it.

All actors in the movie were incredible but ' America' she was very bad and miscast. I did not worry about her.

Sound effects, graphics effects, and everything ending with effects😂 was super cool. I really like it.

In conclusion The started with a nice introduction but ended with a very cringe-ending like every cringe American movies."
Too much,"It's a bad wedding dress of a movie. They've put in everything they had, when a little judicious selecting would have been better. More is not always better, just more. It makes for a lack of rhythm and pacing. And certainly gets in the way of character and dramatic arc."
Satanic,"This may be the movie with most satanistic and ocultist imagery, symbology and themes that i've haver seen in my life. Doctor Strange is an easy depiction of Aleister Crowley, and the duality between him and the Witch the androginy of Baphomet. Don't take your children, as this images are easily absorbed by the unconscious mind by everyone oblivious to their meaning. Danger."
It's truly great,Listen I understand the average/ bad reviews from the younger none mature crowd or people with kids because this movie is dark and twisted and could be scary for kids. But as for a marvel movie it's definitely in my top five. It was action packed from the start the storyline was great the dark and twisted side of things was shot very well it had a couple jump scares added in which I enjoyed. There's really nothing not to like about this movie!
Bore. Only good thing was it created JOBS.,"Terrible fall from the standards set by the first movie. Would've been a lot better if they introduce Cameos in every other scene, and read the script out aloud."
My first review,"Not a big Marvel fan, but it was ok. It kinda felt rush in some moments, a little confusing, and the ending let me with questions. Hopefully it will come a new film in the near future."
Another great movie ruined by its sequel,"The hype for this movie was real and that excitement carried us about 1/4 of the way through the movie. From then on you could actually feel yourself begin to sink with the ship. From the unnecessary child lead acting, the dreadful storyline, to the crappy gore the entire movie unwound the longer you watched. One of the very few Marvel movies I walked away from wishing I had never watched it. Bottom 3 Marvel movies of all time, right up there with X-Men New Mutants and Fantastic Four."
You cant make a worst movie even if you tried.,"Its really bad. Don't waste a single minute watching this. Nothing about it is good, bad acting, bad cinematography, bad story. No Reason or logic just some random hocus-pocus, zombies and unreasonably long time wasting scenes."
Phase 4: The Comedy-verse.,"Dear Marvel.

I understand that your shows are now made for children and supposed adults. Oh well. Another great kids show. Just didn't understand why good and powerful characters like Dr Strange and Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch had to be put through this embarrassment.

The only good parts of the film were the deaths of Captain Marvel and Captain Carter (I feel Reed deserved a worse death for being so stupid)"
First disappointing marvel movie,"I'm a big fan or Doctor Strange and Wanda. So I was pretty excited for this movie. It could've easily been ranked The best movie in the MCU, As it had potential to be one of the greatest MCU movies. But in my opinion this movie unfortunately fell flat.

Not sure if it was the writing or directing of the film.

The lack of character development for both Wanda and Doctor Strange was bizarre. The plot was an overall mess. The only thing that made it the movie decent was the horror aspect and interesting visuals. Other than that it was very dull and I left the theater feeling empty. Which is a first for me with a marvel movie.

I feel like they focused way too much on the horror aspect and action sequences. That they forgot about the actual story and character arcs. Especially for the antagonist.

I'm highly disappointed with the lack of connection to previous characters origin stories. The only people I see praising this movie are either diehard fans of Sam Raimi or people who just love action without an actual plot."
Dr strange in the Madness of Wanda!,
Enjoyable !,"The visuals effects are just incredible!

I enjoyed the film and confirm that no one could have played Dr Strange role like Benedict C. Did.

The entire cast was just amazing !"
The story 😫😫😩,"Even Doctor strange in the Spider-Man of No way Home did better then this Doctor strange .

The story is too madness and going everywhere .

Focus on Doctor strange please .

I'm so disappointed !"
What a great movie!,
Doctor strange,
Sam Raimi gets to make Evil Dead with a big budget!,"I'm not entirely sure what I've just watched.

But what I can tell you is it was a waste of two hours!

The plot is all over the place, the acting is awful and well loved characters are misused to the point that at times, they become unrecognisable.

The cameos are forced in for the sake of it, with the opportunity for something interesting to happen with these characters completely wasted.

I really wanted to like this film, but it was painful to watch at times.

I like that they've tried to inject a horror element into the MCU, but I have no idea why they chose a director who hasn't learnt any new tricks since he first started.

This could have been a really interesting step forward for the franchise, but it falls flat and comes across like they had some good ideas, but just didn't know how to link them all together.

Judging from this movie, Disney are starting to run out of ideas... I really hope that's not the case."
So much witchcraft (spoilers),
"The perfect mix of sci-fi, drama, horror, and comedy","Sam Raimi did not disappoint, much darker than Spiderman: No Way Home, and that makes it superior imo.

Only drawback is that it could have been better if they did not cut the 40 min."
Disappointed,"That movie was such a big mess and a huge disappointment after spider man no way home raised our expectations!

The movie plot was really bad just some random events connected by a very weak plot line.

Using characters from what if with a great potential and ""miss-use"" them in a few minutes."
VFX amazing.....but nothing else .,"As expected the VFX of the movie were amazing, ofcourse it's Marvel we are talking about here . But the story kinda felt off. The dialogues were dumb. The soundtracks were off . Some lame part of the movie . The acting was not quiet good except Benedict."
An Adventurous Movie But not truly Marvel-ish.,"I feel that there has been a steady decline in what the original philosophy of marvel movies, the high action, enthralling and somewhat broken sense humour that made us fall in love with the franchise. The movie feels more like a horror film than a true MCU film. The concept of the multiverse is an absolute joy to watch and Benedict Cumberbatch is probably my favourite MCU actor to watch, smart, cunning, sarcastic and methodical, he brings something new to the table with his incredible acting. And Elizabeth Olsen is an absolute goddess her acting and perfect voice matching is a thing to cherish. However it continuously bothers me to think that Marvel has been slowly discrediting its original six to make new characters in-order to extend the franchise. Yet this is a must watch for all MCU fans out there. And it gets a 7/10 from my side."
Kinda just bad,"The movie has a solid premise but major inconsistencies, the actor is bad and the fights are filled with too much gimics. This movie butchers Wanda's character, the motivations behind the heroes don't make too much sense, it's incredibly predictable. The music fight was so so so poorly done.

There was like one good scene with the mirror world but frankly the movie is a mess with few redeeming characters or scenes.

Would not recommend watching, but worse I think it has actively harmed the MCU."
Childish Rubbish,So disappointed in Marvels churn out of movies they should have stopped after Avengers Endgame! This latest one continues the childish storylines with mediocre acting and subpar production. On plus is watching for nearly free on Disney Plus.z.
An awesome Movie :),I appreciated the new horror twist in the movie and felt it added to the story. Despite some few off voice lines the movie was absolutely top tier in my eyes and was an absolute blast to witness :)
Terrible,"Not good as the first movie. The actress that plays ""America"" is terrible. Cheesy jokes didn't go well with the seriousness of the movie. I'm not sure how people give this movie a 7/10."
Boring first half and slightly better second half but overall average,"Only thing going for this movie is wanda really. Movie is dark but it's not horror man come on. Usuall Corniness that marvel movies have really do not work in this one. At 2hours,movie felt slow but slightly rushed towards the end at the same time??Eh story with mild hook."
"Weak story, average acting but grand CGI.","The story was quite weak and had some holes and sometimes characters felt quite out of character.

The combat looked fantastic but had issues with being rather inconsistent especially in the case of Wanda.

The new character America felt rather uninteresting and small, with screams that truly hurt my ears in the theater.

She was just a plot device that didn't add anything to the story which sadly felt like a missed opportunity considering her fantastical superpower.

It was fantastic to see some new but old characters like Xavier, Reed and even Carter as Captain America.

The horror aspect of the movie was very tiny and barely worth a mention beyond the rather forced jump scares being a bit annoying instead of scary.

I felt that the movie was confused about it's identity and it kept fluctuating between comedy and rather ruthless murdering with some weird horror elements mixed in.

I must add that I personally really liked the ruthless way they showed death in some parts of the movie since it felt more realistic and gave weight to what a monster Wanda had become.

All in all it's worth a watch after you can see it for free on a streaming service and is more of a gateway movie than an actual story, It's clearly opening the way for the future of Marvel movies."
"A great Doctor Strange movie, but a terrible Scarlet Witch movie",
Trailor been more exciting than the movie,
A stunning new direction for the MCU,
An absolutely fantastic entry to the MCU,
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Disappointment,
Just a little bit more.,"The movie was good (6/10) and interesting (6/10), but in the moments when you expect something exciting and big to happen, it doesn't. The small amount of ""horror"" added to the movie was definitely a bonus to the action; it just needed a little bit more Doctor Strange and a little less madness. But if we put those things aside, I highly recommend watching it if you like this type of movies."
Not as good as the first.,"What made the first movie so great was the interesting visual effects that had never before been seen. The kaleidoscope mirror-verse truely Mesmerising all the viewers.

This new one is trying to be a horror in the most cliche way possible. They just slapped a whole bunch of demonic stuff through out it to try make it ""freaky"". This had as much, if not more demonic content than some horrors I've seen, but none of the fear. What makes a good horror is the tension, the scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat or better watching through your fingers. This was not scary at all, so why so much demonic content? Give me jump frights not exorcisms.

Over all it was an ok movie, but the attempts to try take it away from being a typical marvel yet not committing to just making it a scary horror left it just being a mild marvel and even more mild horror."
Overhyped and overall letdown scripts and plot management,"Okay, first of All, this is a decent movie, hell it is a good movie. But that the problem, that's about it. If any of you expecting yet another cinematic breakthrough by Marvel, boy oh boy you're in into a letdown

I need to acknowledge the efforts made to include certain notable characters, but mostly barely known characters that making me questioning how will MCU progress with such lineup in the future. But there's that, abit confusing or unknown new appearance character selection.

So unless you're a massive fan of the comic like the guy sat next to me in the cinema and cheering all the way when nobody does, you won't feel anything.

Now the most important part. The plot. How in the Stange's multiverse that Anyone think the plot is acceptable, the plot forces the character to react out of character and behave poorly and inconsistently throughout the movie to make the story goes, which really bugs me.

Trying not to include spoiler here but, I'd say that Strange is the wise-est of the Avengers at this moment, but somehow throughout the movie, most of his action are not what you would expect from someone in his caliber, and not to mention the plot convivence, the sudden ability to control certain stuff/power, and to defeat the main villain with the power of trust and friendship. Just cheesy and disappointing.

Finally the plot pacing. Its not the best. The first 30min, everything goes as fast as sonic, the plot unveiled quickly and hastily, spoiling the suspense I would say, and for the rest of the story it's start slowing down, and sometimes too slow!

Thus conclude my 6/10, its good but don't expect more especially from the fan's overhyped."
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of VFX,"This movie is 75% VFX and 25% plot (and I'm generous). Good family-friendly jump scares and horror vibe, not bad fightings and useless cameos. If you are a Marvel fan-boy, a less than 15yo kid or someone who never watched a well done movie before, u will be able to appreciate this movie.

But for me it is a big NO.

4 stars are mainly for the amazing VFX, more blood and seriousness, and because the plot is so useless and stupid that probably they wrote in on the toilet during the morning poop."
Great science fiction movie,"I love this movie , storyline , and vfx I suggest to watch this movie one of the best marvel movie and screenplay also good if you wants , science fiction , action , perfect story line and little horror. The go for it ."
Always lower your expectations.,"Lower your expectations so you wont get disappointments. I know we have different kind of type whats best movies for us, but why people always higher their expectations?😂. I mean, this is what Sam Raimi can give us and this is the best he can do. Respect."
NOT MATCHING THE HYPE THAT WAS CREATED.,"Sam Raimi definitely put a splash of horror in this film.

However the villan was revealed too soon in the film as well as there was not a scene that one could say is a memorable one."
A struggle,"My biggest issue with this is that you really do need to watch multiple different MCU projects in order to fully understand what's going on and the importance of certain moments which isn't a good thing. It should be able to stand on its own or, at the very least, have most of its ties to the first Doctor Strange film so you would just have to watch that one."
Missed The Mark,"Dr. Strange 2 is basically the teenaged edgelord younger brother of the Marvel franchise who thinks he's so cool but actually isn't.

First, did the movie have to be so demonic and satanic to be ""interesting""? It's like they took every dark element of Twilight, The Walking Dead, and other dark fantasy/supernatural shows and threw them together haphazardly. Too much.

Also, what's up with the PG-13 rating? This should've been R for the amount of graphic content (brutal murder, gore, etc.). It is NOT kid-friendly.

The plot fell flat. It felt more like the movie was trying too hard to include fanservice and flex its visual effects than making good use of its cameos and having a compelling story line. Sorry, Raimi. I loved your Spider-Man movies, but this one ain't it."
Less Multiverse more Madness of Horror,"This movie is one of my fav movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it at cinema.

Visuals, cgi, direction, camera work, bgm, acting, horror element, jump scares, everything were op, but my main concerned is it is not that much of madness of multiverse, so about cameos you should keep your expectations low, they should've named movie 'Dr Strange Madness of Wanna', storyline and the ending were mid, there were many plot holes but nonetheless it was really a masterpiece to enjoy at cinemas..."
Entertaining but....,Entertaining but....if you don't like or don't know Sam Raimi's movie in 80's you better go out. Not suitable or good for you. Good but not fresh story. It's Sam Raimi's Universe.
Not upto the hype,
Not nearly enough cape jokes at all whatsoever.,"When I heard this film was coming out I was exhillarated! I watched all the trailers and sorted through the many, MANY fan theories. Alot of them were insane, some of them were likely, but almost none came true. I didn't have any theories that I subscribed to per se. Although I did have one idea for the film of which I hoped would make it in. I wanted a joke in relation the cape that the titular Docter Strange wears. A pun, a gag, a joke ,a little bit of a funny bit to do with the seemingly sentient cape. I admit, there was one scene where the cape gets up and starts punching Strange in the face to wake him up, this was the funniest thing I had seen the whole movie. I laughed out loud in the cinema, the laughing quickly turned to screaming. I couldn't breathe, it was so funny. I even peed a little! I was kicked out and banned from the cinema for this and I had to pay for and download the movie so I could watch it at home where I could lol all I wanted, of course my neighbours did file a noise complaint and the cops did knock at my door when I watched the scene for a second time, but that's besides the point. My experiance trying to watch this movie and get through that bit was quite hard and did contribute to my one star review but nonetheless, this severe lack of REAL cape jokes was a problem for me. The bit with the cape punching Strange was a little bit funny of course but it wasn't a REAL joke. It wasn't acknowledged by any of the other characters and it was quickly forgotten. Exuse me for a moment as I need to take a break from thinking about that wonderous cape scene.

I am back five hours later after letting all that laughter out from thinking about cape jokes. This makes me realise that, opportunities which presented themselves were missed on numerous occasions to add cape jokes. It's as if two sets of writers didn't communicate - one team setting up the opportunity' and rhe second team not following through. The first set needed to explicitly write 'add cape joke here' for the less capable second team. As well, it should have been called Dr Strange in the multiverse of sadness. I mean they make a joke about spider-man's webs coming out of his arse for godsake, like that's still relevant! I mean the cape fits much better into the narrative of the movie! Like, America Chavez could have said ""The Docter Strange in the last universe didn't have a cape! I mean, does it poop?"". That would have gotten a solid chuckle out of me for sure! Or maybe a running gag of the cape trying to help by telling Strange what to do, and by the post credits scene the cape could grow a mouth and start speaking. They could flesh out the cape's character in a cape movie or Disney plus show. This could develop into the cape becoming a fan favourite. Overtaking Iron man and Spider-man! Instead they decieded to have no cape jokes at all! This movie is the worst movie of the 20's! 1/10 stars! 0/10 if I could. TL;DR, No cape jokes, banned from my local cinema."
They showed us a scarlet witch movie,
Best and awesome multiverse of madness,
Worst Marvel Movie! DO NOT SEE IF YOU LOVE DR STRANGE OR MARVEL,"Dr Strange has just been destroyed. The Marvel movies, universe -all of them, including Disneyland Marvel experience. Embarrassing to several actor's reputations. Bad writing, no great lines, very little story, very poor character development and connection except for maybe 10 minutes at the end. Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Benedict Wong could not save this movie and I personally feel very badly for them. SAVE YOURSELF AND STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE.

Still In shock.

Tainted my love for Marvel and Disney."
Do not see this movie if you haven't seen WandaVision,Scarlet Witch story start to make tone of senses after seeing WandaVision series. My initial rating was 4. Wanda Maximov fixation about family was not credible. After watching WandaVision series i changed my rating to 8.
"Too many jump scares and special effects, zero content",
Just awful,"This movie Is just stupid. It is ridiculous. Terrible acting by everyone... especially the children. One of the worst films I've seen after the new Matrix and Captain Marvel. How this film has a rating of 7.5/10 is beyond me.

Must be all the die hard marvel fans giving it a 10/10.

A very poor film. I would give this film a 4/10 max."
Very disappointed,If you are a marvel universe storyline follower.you mustn't waste your time watch this one.if you're bored af then you can watch this at YOUR home. Its total waste of money if you are thinking about watching this at cinema centre.i almost slept during half time lol.killed some heroes just for nothing. And wanda's attacking strategy got some major faults. Strange's some moves was total hilarious.its more of a normal movie rather than a marvel universe movie.its the 2nd worst marvel movie after Eternal from my pov.
It just doesn't work,Plot: inexistent. Engagement of the spectator: impossible. Aesthetics: beautiful. Content: awful. As cinema (in terms of art): awful. As entertainment: also bad. Seems they are more interested in delivering movies and series at regular intervals than with quality. Don't wast your time with this one.
Some cool scenes but the first one was way better,"Doctor Strange's world gives the director opportunities to get very creative and i thought Sam Raimy delivered on that part. The visuals were great during some scenes but overall i think Marvel is getting more and more heavy on the CG, and i feel that the ""world bending"" visuals were a lot better in the first Doctor Strange and in No way Home. Overall a bit disappointing, some characters have no place in this story other than make the fans cheer for 5 minutes.

I like the ""horror"" aspects of the movie and i truly hope marvel have the guts to make more darker movies with some of the characters in their universe

Overall, i left unsatisifed from the theaters."
I think people missed the landing,
Needed more backstory,
Predictable garbage,"This has got to be the worst marvel movie to date(and I'm including the 1979 spider-Man movie).

Predictable dialogue and numerous chaotic scenarios, which don't follow the cinematic glory of the previous phases. I honestly can't see where marvel can go from her.

Stan Lee must be spinning in his grave.

Some of the worst acting I've seen for a long time.

WTAF was John Krasinski preparing for for this role?

Reed (dad bod) Richard's?

And Benedict Wong's speech impediment appeared from nowhere.

Overall a ridiculously disappointing film.

Get it together Marvel!"
Unnecessary! To say the least.,
Dr Strange is ?,"Well the previews before the movie started was pretty good,

The Top Gun looks pretty cool.

Mass confusion watching this movie.

Popcorn wasn't bad,

Thor looks kinda cool,

O Yeah, the movie Strange, if you want to skip and wait for your home movie system to watch it, Yeah that's what I should of done."
Not worth the price,
Technically good looking,Visually thie movie was great but you can paint a good picture of a turd if you want. Plus america chaves is the epitome of just a plot device escort mission of a character . Have you ever seen a painting that you want to like but can't cus someone just threw paint at a canvas and hoped it would stick? This is the Jackson pollack of super hero movies. It may get some people going but i am not one of those people. This movie annoyed me so bad I created this account just to express my disdain and scream my dislike of this admittedly visually impressive eyeball finger-blasting.
Multiverse of Nothingness,"Doctor Strange: In the Multiverse of Madness is a film that fails to do what Spider Man: No Way Home did. It keeps me interested and on the edge but never gives me the cheer moments that you want to see. Sam Rami's style is beautiful and strange in this movie, but in a good way. Cumberbatch is himself (I did really liked the dynamic he had with the illuminate is fantastic but no spoilers), and so is Olsen. But, Xochitl Gomez stands out to me in a good way. She brings a new feel to the MCU and in my opinion, made the movie better. But next time marvel, add some more cameos. Overall, a really great movie."
"It is Strange Madness, that's for sure.",
It was... ok,"Fan of the Marvel movies-this didn't really feel like a ""marvel movie"" to me. With each solo character movie like Iron man, captain America, Thor- even the Disney+ series, their individual stories showed growth/development. I like that they tried to switch it up some with the madness & horror which is fine but fans of Doctor Strange would've liked to see more character development/growth & maybe more focus on the actual title character.

Great acting from everyone & the cameos were nice until... spoiler."
Not as awful as some reviews,"I don't usually comment here but I feel like I should do some justice to this film. I personally don't think this is a waste of time and I did enjoy it. There were definitely flaws in the storyline since if you've never watch WandaVision you would have absolutely no clue what's going on. It's kinda funny how WandaVision matters more than Dr. Strange 1.

The horror aspect was great and it adds a bit more flavor to the film, and I think the horror part made the movie a whole lot better as it distracts you from the flaws in the storyline. America's acting was pretty bad and basic, the resolution was basic, nothing surprising. Cumberbatch was great though.

The CGI was cool like the first movie, a bit more scarier though, I enjoyed nonetheless. Fighting scenes are cool and exciting and I had a great time in the theater eating popcorn."
Better the more you watch,
Feel like watching spider man 1 (2002),"Sam Raimi did a poor job, I dont expect to watch a MCU movie in 2022 using cinema angle, tech, and shot back in 2002. Trying to bring back the 90s horror glory? It's fine, but please make a good reason to do so. The movie length is 127 mins but I think that 100 mins will be quite enough for Its lengthy and make the pace out-fo.

Again, i agree too madness of the director and not multiverse enough of Dr Strange to extend the MCU world."
It's ok,If you're a dedicated marvel fan then you'll enjoy it quite a bit as it's Raimis classic formula and style of the comic book movie genre. However if you're not a marvel fan and don't know too much idk if you'll like the movie as much.
Decent film despite the box ticking nonsense,"The film was of a good standard. Elizabeth Olson was really good. It's just a shame, yet again in every film at the moment, that all this box ticking garbage spoiled it a bit. I wish these film companies would just focus on making awesome movies, rather than brown nose these idiot woke types."
Not completed,I feel like the store doesn't add anything to the Marvel universe and the phase 4. But it's honestly good but there are some things that shouldn't be Added.
Awesome movie,"I re-watched it i like the movie so much than I watched it on theater Dr Stephen Strange casts a forbidden spell that opens a portal to the multiverse. However, a threat emerges that may be too big for his team to handle.

Release date: 6 May 2022 (India) Director: Sam Raimi Starring: Benedict Cumberbatch; Elizabeth Olsen; Chiwetel Ejiofor; Benedict Wong; Xochitl Gomez; Michael Stuhlbarg; Rachel McAdams Distributed by: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Based on: Marvel Comics Written by: Michael Waldron."
Good Movie,"I went with my daughter and both enjoyed it. I love it you enter in a new dimension of Strange. Benedict is the best. It is s movie from Marvel Studio. The movie delivers all the action and visual excitement. I saw it in the movie, I think it's better than in home."
Subpar plot with good action,"Dr strange is one of my favorite characters in the MCU, so I was mad that this film didn't do him justice. The plot is kinda like Kung Fu Panda 3, but very disjointed and strung together with random items and abilities to make things work out, which feels very contrived. There are lots of weird moments in dramatic sequences where the pacing is off, which messed up my immersion. I didn't like America Chavez's character, just bad acting up against Cumberbatch and I was left wanting more of characters that barely got any screen time. As far as effects go though it was pretty cool, but yikes on any substantive stuff Marvel."
More!,"I love this movie, we just need more of it!

I'm so excited for what else they have to show for us all, hoping that some of the characters will be back for another MCU tv shows and movies!!

Elizabeth Olsen as the Scarlet Witch was definitely amazing!

And of course Benedict Cumberbatch and the others too The story is kinda sad at the same time, continuing the end of Wandavision. We are hoping to see Vision with Doctor Strange too!! Working together for Wanda."
GREAT MOVIE if you like drinking dog water and hate plots and character development.,"Terrible all the way around. Too much CGI BS and no plot development or ANYTHINNG else.

This is the last episode of WandaVision staring Dr. Strange. Cant believe we waited this long for a second Dr. Strange and they desecrated him like this.

Zombie Dr. Strange? Are you freaking kidding me......"
Fun film,"The movie fun was good and a lot of fun but it could have done better in the story

There was a lot of exaggeration in the story that was inconsistent with other Marvel films. For example, Wanda's power was sometimes high and sometimes low."
Could we not let Sam Raimi anywhere near MCU from now on? Please.,"If I'm being honest, I'm not that hardcore of a guy about comic books and other stuff, but always loved MCU. And I think Iron Man in 2008 paved a perfect road for more films to follow. Keep it clean, keep it pretty logic, so audience can engage with heroes and story.

This film it's just a convoluted mess. Especialy in terms of power levels. It's ""not being reasonable"" about averall logic, heroes arcs basicaly not existant, all the way through the film you could see many of the worst ""hero-movies"" stamps like ""It's not gonna be Wanda, It's gonna be a Scarlet Witch""(Wanda). Who in the hell talks like this?

I heard this movie is gonna be dark, it's not dark - it's dumb.

I heard this movie is gonna be horror, it's not horror, it's Horrible.

Is it ANY good? Not really.

Should you watch it? If you're bored and want to be pissed - probably.

Overall production value and acting is great as almost always.

5/10."
Recover stolen crypto,"Falling victim of a scam can be depressing, you were given empty promises.

MASTERPIECE STRANGE MOVIE,"I have watched the movie yesterday in Hotstar, I don't know the Technical and in depth details, but a superhero movie lover wooooow.

What a story line., 2.6 Hrs with single sitting The Movie don't have fantasy superheros fighting like endgame and No-wayhome that expectation pay off for negative reviews.

Loooving and waiting Next strange Move.from Sam Raimi........"
"7.3/10, disappointing given the possibilities but still not bad",
dear god,
It was worth the money,
Doctor strange,"I thought the movie was overall quite good but the storyline was quite bad and boring, i feel that the storyline was not that much to entertain or fill up 2 hours of a movie. The peformance and acting was very good i felt that Elizabeth olsen did a very good job portraying wanda."
CGI Heaven,
The worst editing and cinematography approach ever!,"I'm not gonna even start talking about the non existing and from little importance plot twist. However the editing of the film felt like the directors just discovered all PowerPoint slideshow animation! What were those wavy moments. This felt so cheap. To top it up there were two scenes blending into one moment in such a cheap irrelevant manner as the two moments were complete different to each other to create a smooth unnoticeable blending and reminded me of the singing scenes of Lion King 1994.

The CGI was even worst. At points I could see the unedited part between America's hear and the green-screen.

There was a lot of experimentation of camera angle which usually is a good thing but definatly not in this film. The dutch angles that are used to create feeling of psychedelia we're just over used and at times unnecessary."
Sam Raimi should leave the director's chair as soon as possible!!!,"I hate when director gives dominant power to certain character just for the arc of the story. Animes like naruto has been using this kind of thing. There was so much potential to this movie.

The illuminate seems like the weakest and dumbest version of avengers. If falcon was in this movie as an antagonist he could have defeated the whole illuminate members

People here saying that expectations were too high for this movie... Well it should be.. Its how they advertise in the trailer. And its not that we wanted like avengers endgame all we wanted was a movie where characters has a effect on the story and were there not just for the sake of cameos."
better than endgame,
They have lost there values.,"I think by making a movie like this, and with a superhero favour like strange, have they crossed a line of marvels values, (in a bad way) This is not what you expect from a marvel movie. I'm looking forward to see how they will pull back to the true marvel.

5 stars is primarily because of the great pictures that doctor strange movies normally bring."
Screw the haters,"Best Marvel film ever. Really not sure why it's getting so much hate. Fantastic visuals and lots of fan service for both Marvel and Raimi fans. Don't get put off by the negative comments, judge it for yourself."
Average movies ever .,"Doctor strange is my one of the favourite mcu character. But Sam raimi did so wrong ,whole movie was showing that movie has based on Wanda not on Doctor strange and the costume evolution was so cheap 😔 i like the costume which showed in Spiderman NWH, Doctor strange, Avengers infinity war.

Thanks I hope you work on it......."
It's crap after crap,"The grandeur of earlier Marvel movies like winter Soldier etc are nowhere in these recent movies now. These are just mediocre movies to be fed to under teens. Any serious Marvel movie fan would denounce this Dr Strange 2 and other recent ones and call for serious pause and overhaul before they ruin the entire franchise. Atleast we had fun till it was good. Sorry for new kids to this fan club, move on this ain't worth the hype."
:),"It was boring and the trama was pretty mediocre. Also kinda ""hard to follow"". I think that this film is one of the worst films of Marvel. But i loved Wanda's story."
Absolutely loved it! Could've been a 10 starrer....,"This film is one of the most enjoyable films by Marvel! The usage of horror elements in a superhero fantasy film, paired with excellent production values and technical aspects, makes this film special for me. It is full of surprises and jump-scare moments for someone who's used to watching Marvel movies. These techniques are also not overused. This is the brilliant part of the film.

Now, coming to what it genuinely lacks. It could've been 10/10 film but it didn't. There are some reasons I observed as a Marvel fan and audience and a critic.

The movie could've balanced the scenes of ""madness"" with scenes showing the multiverse, but it focused more on the madness than the multiverse.

The story of Scarlett Witch was bleak, and nothing unique. It is like those cliché Hollywood stories, where the antagonist is a gullible & emotional idiot, who can be transformed by bringing his/her family in front of him/her. This makes the whole film pointless.

The introduction of few new characters and showing the infinite possibilities within MCU is something that will impress an audience."
Always Awesome.,Fabulous movie. Loved it. I watched this 6 times . Enjoy With friends and family. Best movie ever I have seen. Loved it. Absolutely Awesome. Go right now & watch the movie & enjoy as well.
Good movie,
Fun and Unexpected!,I really loved this movie. Lots of character development and surprises! And of course action and the graphics are out of this multiverse!! Benedict Cumberbatch just makes the most phenomenal Dr. Strange!
"Overall, the film is nothing short of being a 2hr 6min thrill ride, and Sam Raimi hasn't missed a day.","'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness' marks Sam Raimi's return to filmmaking after nearly a decade. Throughout the 2 hour 6 minute runtime, viewers are treated to a fast adventure through the multiverse.

Although this movie is part of the larger MCU, it veers away from the formulaic approach to past films, and gives the director more freedom like in 'Eternals' (2021). Truly, this is pure Sam Raimi. Released 15 years to the week after Spider-Man 3, Raimi clearly knows his way around the genre.

As the second installment in the Doctor Strange series, this is a continuation of this multiverse saga that began with WandaVision, and was continued by Loki and Spider-Man: No Way Home.

The movie follows Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) as his world is flipped upside down when he meets America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) who's on the run from a magical demon. After jumping through universes, we visit the Illuminati, and adventure unfolds.

Although Doctor Strange is the main character, Elizabeth Olsen truly shines as Wanda Maximoff. Her performance is truly captivating as you can feel all of the emotional buildup over the last 18 months of her journey. Xochitl Gomez is also a scene stealer, bringing charisma and charm to her lines in what could be interpreted as a very dark script.

Overall, the film is nothing short of being a 2hr 6min thrill ride, and Sam Raimi hasn't missed a day."
Awesome,
"Nice visual effects, disappointing storyline","Ok, the actors and the visual effects deserve all the stars from this review. And that's it, unfortunately. The storyline is unimpressive and childish. The horror elements have nothing to do with Marvel and superhero world. It's disappointing! I watched the other movies with my kids, but this one definitely not! It's more like zombie apocalypse+superhero lame scenes and that's it."
Can't find a fault but...,"Everything about this movie is done well, however I still didn't enjoy it like all the others.

Acting was good, plot was good, action scenes done well, but it just didn't give you that feeling of a typical Marvel film."
Hmmm...,"I didn't love it. But I didn't hate it either. This had so much potential to be way better than it was. So many missed opportunities to create an actual story and not focus on the horror aspect. Don't get me wrong, Raimi is great at what he does, however it didn't need to be overdone to carry this movie. Just go into the movie and watch it for what it is and leave your expectations at the door."
It is a multicurse for die heart marvel fan.,
John Krasinski???,
Subversive and Encouraging,
Not a compelling story line,Why couldn't the scarlet witch just ask the kid and Dr strange nicely to help her find her kids 😒. Motive and plot of the main villan in the movie is very weak. Still an excellent movie with special effects to watch.
"Watchable, I guess.",
Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Sadness,"Imagine baking a cake. You find the recipe from a cooking website targeted toward white suburban moms. You gather all the ingredients and lay them all out in front of you and begin the cooking process. Out comes an amazing, taste-bud-provoking, bliss-invoking cake. The cake is so good that you decide to make it again the next week, and the next week, and the next. A year later, the cake is not the same, in fact, you have to force yourself to eat it. The first cake was Iron Man, and the last one was Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness. I can't eat anymore cake.

Marvel writers are following the same recipe that has worked to garner billions at the box office. In this new Doctor Strange, there is a Latina woman named America Chavez (which is weird, why name this girl America, it caused a great deal of confusion for me at the start), played by Xochitl Gomez. Who? Disney, the second-largest entertainment company that can afford any actor in the world, chose an actor nobody knows. Okay, you might be saying that maybe it's cause she was an amazing actor that deserves a chance and killed it at the casting call. No. That was not it. She was a terrible actor with emotionless facial expressions, I could barely even watch the scenes she was in.

Enough with the woke casting choices, that didn't bother me as much as the inconsistent dialogue, chaotic plot, and character arcs. But hey, the movie was shiny and filled with lots of cool colors! From the beginning to the end the pacing was so off. In the slow parts, I would just think about how lame that part was, or why Doctor Strange doesn't fly up the 1,000 stairs and instead walks. Or how Wanda, the villain who is supposedly the strongest character in the MCU, takes a few minutes to fight off a captain America woman. I just don't get it. I wanted to like it, I'm a fan of Marvel and loved Iron Man and the Avengers series, but I just don't get it. And now Morbius, another new Marvel movie, is supposed to be one of the worst movies ever. I'm not even gonna watch it.

Somewhere in the multiverse, there is a new Marvel movie that is original, unique, and does not follow the generic, boring Marvel recipe."
Marvel First Ever Horror Flick.,
Strange,
Awesome and Constant Action Scenes,"It brought some of the great MCU action. However, it seems like they were in a HUGE hurry. There were so many areas where the plot concluded without being developed. The writers aren't building suspense in the past couple MCU films. This one is no exception. I wouldn't stand in line for this."
"just another flat ""Avengers"" movie","Unfortunately the best parts from the first movie were left to create just another politically correct flat action Avengers movie.

The kid has two mothers, the villain is woman who kill men superheroes just with a look but have tough fight with the other women - yeah these things start to get annoying."
didnt live up to the expectations,"All those marketting for basically another Dark World alike marvel movie.. if it werent for the cast and flashy scenes my rate would have been way lower.

Over all this is below average and the first movie and definately is not on par with NWH, infinity war or Endgame.

As multiverse introduced killing become meaningless, and just for the sake of it there was alot of buddy counts in this movie that frankly left me in a questioning state, didnt enjoyed the ride, no consequences, and characters didnt feel right, didnt feel like themselves.. for the sake of horror they threw the MCU magic."
Great Visually but storyline makes no sense,"Hands down best visuals in any Marvel movie so far.

Storyline in the movie is significantly different than the description in IMDB and what and how they displayed it in trailer. Seems like they had to change important pieces of storyline last minute."
"Cool effects, repeat plot, too scary for marvel",
I didn't like the script,"This movie isn't about Doctor Strange, it's about Wanda.

Doctor Strange doesn't have a deep story Wanda has a deep story.

If you have watched the ""..what if?"" series, this movie will seem very shallow to you.

But CGI is perfect."
Fresh take from Marvel,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a fresh breath of air! Expected something like Spider-man No Way Home, but was totally positively surprised."
"It's madness, but entertaining","It's madness all the incursions occurring during the film, but surely despite all the crazy parts is an entertaining movie experience. I highly recommend curb expectations about continuation of previous story lines."
Awesome visuals,"Wow, the horror aspect of the movie was amazing. Doctor Strange definitely needs to keep this tone in future movies. Scarlet Witch was the key player in this film, which was great and disappointing at the same time. The multiverse should have been front and center and I feel like this film failed in that aspect. Would have like to have seen more alternate versions of characters, maybe reintroduce some of the characters that have left the project. For me this film is nearly perfect, but I'm bias and understand this isn't for everyone and compared to other Marvel masterpieces this is definitely mid to top B tier."
Too much branches and details,"The core of the story is lost with lot of push to include too much of everything.

Graphics below expectations in the multiverse.

Missing a great suspense factor like the previous movie."
Truly a disappointment!,
Please! Save the MCU,"I fear for the quality of the next films, good effects, but a frustrating story, but the body of work is interesting. The special effects are great, but at the end that shines is the Scarlet Witch. I really enjoyed the performance of the main characters, in the end I think all my almost eternal wait was worth it."
This review has nothing to do with this great movie. But,"As a Muslim, I am not shocked by some of ""them"" preparation for the Antichrist, but what is surprising is that they know everything.. they really know everything, but they continue to brainwash us since childhood, just as I was expecting some specific companies, not Marvel.. Thanks for the warning.

And as for my review of the movie, it's great, as Dr. Strange usual, but please don't make it strange as it is in his name in the next movie with this Third Eye. It's (Strange) and scary.

As a Muslim."
Strange Feeling,"The movie graphics and action were.entertaining, but the plot was chaotic and out of touch. I felt it being more comical if anything, how silly some dialogue was and how the scenarios played out. I would not watch it again and it is definitely not worth going to the cinema for it, however it is a somewhat okay film to watch at home."
Horrifically Bland,
I'd watch wonder woman 84 again over this,I love marvel I do...but after endgame it seems like they are giving me a box of turd with a shiny sticker on it. It's too dark for my kid to watch which to be honest none of the other movies have had people on fire getting impaled every other second...I just don't care it didn't even hook me we got an hour and a half in and we're like thank god we didn't pay for it and or waste time getting a sitter...we're going to play a drinking game and take shots when we get bored because I have to finish it because MARVEL I am really hopefully for love and thunder in a week because at least taika watiti can direct a movie I'll like....
This film makes me too much worried for upcoming movies.,
"Small, but with creative visual effects","Must watch for Marvel fans. One time watchable for rest of other. Simple Story, Amazing VFX, small runtime.

Wanda too much. Multiverse concept not good for future story, because now they can kill anyone, anytime and make them alive anytime in story.

Good acting, Very good direction, average Background music, Excellent VFX."
May have replaced The Dark World for my least favorite MCU movie,
Kinda OK,
All over the place,"Interesting concepts and ideas, but the storyline is all over the place. It keeps viewers wondering whether it is a marvel comic show or a horror movie."
,"To much time focused on social issues of today and not enough actual story and character development, it's hard to watch a movie that can just randomly kill off characters and no one really cares."

,"Okay, so I really loved this one except for a few issues. The big one being, yes the marketing team pretty much spoiled every cameo, except for maybe one or two, completely shattering expectations. I kept thinking, ""wow! If they're showing us these characters in the trailers, they must have bigger surprises in store!"" I know it was almost impossible to live up to the hype, but still... for a company that basically reinvented, and monopolized the ""cinematic universe"" to do a Marvel Multi-verse movie, this seems like a wasted opportunity to me. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved it! But they had such a great chance to deliver so much more than what we got. With a multi-versal movie like this, we could have gotten so many more characters (old, new, and even one-offs) without the expectation of seeing them again. I really wanted to see a fight ala Ultron vs The Watcher in What If..? Where they're just crashing through universes, falling into quick battle shots of other characters. I absolutely blame the marketing team! But it was still one hell of a ride!"

,"The movie is another beautiful piece by Marvel yet leaves you hungry and expecting. You would want more and seek a deeper impact. The concept of the Multiverse ""touched"" beautifully but creates many questions and some scenes leave you wonder what is next."
,"It feels rushed. CGI was just ok. There was just something missing. Between introducing the illuminati, and killing them all, I just didnt like it. Not for that reason alone, but there are a lot of things in there that are just too busy."
,"No comment necessary. Storyline, acting were horrible. Graphics were solid, only reason it got a one star

Don't bother with the second post credit scene."

,"I, Infact most of the audience beleives that this movie would've been the best Marvel movie of all time, If they didn't cut the original 2 hr 40 min cut into just 2 hr 6 min because there is so much less multiverse and much more madness in this."
